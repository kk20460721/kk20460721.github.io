<div id="t2_105" class="t s1_105">me, we are made for each other!" And within two or three weeks these people who are </div>
<div id="t3_105" class="t s1_105">made for each other are finished. </div>
<div id="t4_105" class="t s1_105">In fact, nobody is made for anybody else; everybody is made for himself or herself. </div>
<div id="t5_105" class="t s1_105">Nobody is made for anybody -- God never makes you in pairs! Drop that whole </div>
<div id="t6_105" class="t s1_105">nonsense. He simply makes individuals. </div>
<div id="t7_105" class="t s1_105">In the East we have stories -- they must be stories, they cannot be history. In Jaina </div>
<div id="t8_105" class="t s1_105">scriptures it is said that in the beginning when the world started, God used to make </div>
<div id="t9_105" class="t s1_105">men and women together. Each mother used to give birth to twins, one girl, one boy; </div>
<div id="ta_105" class="t s1_105">they were going to be husband and wife. They were not sister and brother -- they were </div>
<div id="tb_105" class="t s1_105">made for each other! That must be a wish fulfillment. Man has always been thinking, </div>
<div id="tc_105" class="t s1_105">"There must be someone with whom I am going to fit absolutely. Somewhere someone </div>
<div id="td_105" class="t s1_105">must exist who is just for me and I am for her." There is nobody just for you or you for </div>
<div id="te_105" class="t s1_105">anybody. God creates only individuals, God believes in individuality -- he is an </div>
<div id="tf_105" class="t s1_105">individualist. </div>
<div id="tg_105" class="t s1_105">In fact, marriage is a human invention, God does not believe in marriage. He himself is </div>
<div id="th_105" class="t s1_105">alone without a wife; you can see -- the point is so clear. Otherwise he would at least </div>
<div id="ti_105" class="t s1_105">have married the Holy Ghost! The Holy Ghost can be turned into a woman or a man -- a </div>

<div id="tl_105" class="t s1_105">man -- he gave man first a woman, Lilith. And Lilith was really a beautiful woman, but </div>
<div id="tm_105" class="t s1_105">the first night there was a pillow fight -- the first liberated woman! The Women's </div>
<div id="tn_105" class="t s1_105">Liberation movement started with Lilith. And the fight was because God had given </div>
<div id="to_105" class="t s1_105">them only a single bed and both wanted to sleep on it and it was not big enough for two </div>
<div id="tp_105" class="t s1_105">persons. Lilith simply rejected the idea that she should sleep on the floor. She said, "If </div>
<div id="tq_105" class="t s1_105">you want to sleep on the floor you can!" </div>
<div id="tr_105" class="t s1_105">Adam felt very insulted -- a man, and sleeping on the floor, and the woman sleeping in </div>

<div id="t12_105" class="t s1_105">ugly act, that is very antifeminist. And since then God has been a male chauvinist pig! </div>
<div id="t13_105" class="t s1_105">Nobody is made for anybody else, hence no two persons can fit absolutely. All your </div>
<div id="t14_105" class="t s1_105">ideas about fitting with the other are illusions, and they are shattered sooner or later. </div>
