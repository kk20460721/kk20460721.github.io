<div id="t1_105" class="t s1_105">It is very rare to find a real man. Even to find a peacock is very rare. There are only rats, </div>
<div id="t2_105" class="t s1_105">white and black and all colors of rats! It is not an accident that psychologists go on </div>
<div id="t3_105" class="t s1_105">studying rats to understand man. Strange, trying to understand rats so as to understand </div>
<div id="t4_105" class="t s1_105">man! But not really, not really so strange as it appears, because the majority of men live </div>
<div id="t5_105" class="t s1_105">like rats. </div>
<div id="t6_105" class="t s1_105">The psychology of Pavlov is based on the study of dogs, and the psychology of Skinner </div>
<div id="t7_105" class="t s1_105">is based on the study of rats. And both are perfectly true as far as the majority of </div>
<div id="t8_105" class="t s1_105">humanity is concerned. Only once in a while they may not be right. If they try to apply </div>
<div id="t9_105" class="t s1_105">their psychology on a buddha they may not be right, but as far as the ordinary </div>
<div id="ta_105" class="t s1_105">humanity is concerned they are perfectly right. What has happened to man? He has lost </div>
<div id="tb_105" class="t s1_105">all meaning and significance for the simple reason that he has become a very cowardly </div>
<div id="tc_105" class="t s1_105">being. He lives in such cowardly ways, he is so afraid of anything new. </div>
<div id="td_105" class="t s1_105">I know people who have been listening to me for years -- ten years, twelve years, fifteen </div>
<div id="te_105" class="t s1_105">years -- and they go on saying to me, "We want to become sannyasins, but we are still </div>
<div id="tf_105" class="t s1_105">thinking." And they go on finding excuses, sometimes one excuse, sometimes another </div>
<div id="tg_105" class="t s1_105">excuse. They love me, but they are not courageous enough to declare it. They hide the </div>
<div id="th_105" class="t s1_105">fact. They are not courageous to move into this unknown dimension of sannyas. They </div>
<div id="ti_105" class="t s1_105">love me so they listen to me, and they love me so sometimes they think that one day </div>
<div id="tj_105" class="t s1_105">they are going to become sannyasins, but they go on finding excuses to postpone it. </div>
<div id="tk_105" class="t s1_105">It is because of this cowardliness that man has lost all meaning and significance. All joy, </div>
<div id="tl_105" class="t s1_105">all bliss, all ecstasy, has disappeared. Man looks very sad. Even if he laughs, his </div>
<div id="tm_105" class="t s1_105">laughter looks phony, mechanical, false -- something cultivated, managed, not coming </div>
<div id="tn_105" class="t s1_105">from the depths. It has no profundity, it does not sound like it is coming from the </div>
<div id="to_105" class="t s1_105">center. It is only a painted smile on the circumference. </div>
<div id="tp_105" class="t s1_105">Do you know how the word 'phony' came into existence? It came because of the </div>
<div id="tq_105" class="t s1_105">telephone. When the telephone was invented and people started listening to others </div>
<div id="tr_105" class="t s1_105">thousands of miles away on the telephone, the voice sounded strange. It is bound to be </div>
<div id="ts_105" class="t s1_105">so. It is mechanical; it has not that authenticity. And there was nobody behind it; it was </div>
<div id="tt_105" class="t s1_105">coming out of nowhere. Hence the word 'phony'. You smile, but you don't seem to be </div>
<div id="tu_105" class="t s1_105">behind it; you may not be there at all. </div>
<div id="tv_105" class="t s1_105">And now even a new thing has come into existence. At least in the old days you could </div>
<div id="tw_105" class="t s1_105">imagine that on the other side there must be somebody. Now there may be just a tape </div>
<div id="tx_105" class="t s1_105">recorder saying, "Hello. How are you?" </div>
<div id="ty_105" class="t s1_105">I have heard: </div>
<div id="tz_105" class="t s1_105">One psychologist became very tired with a patient, tired because he was saying the </div>
<div id="t10_105" class="t s1_105">same things again and again. And he was so rich that there was no hope of getting rid </div>
<div id="t11_105" class="t s1_105">of him! So the psychologist said, "You do one thing. I will leave my tape recorder and </div>
<div id="t12_105" class="t s1_105">you go on talking to the tape recorder. And whenever I have time I will listen to it." </div>
<div id="t13_105" class="t s1_105">The man said, "That's perfectly right" -- because psychologists sit behind a screen, </div>
<div id="t14_105" class="t s1_105">particularly Freudian psychologists. The patient lies down on the couch and the </div>
<div id="t15_105" class="t s1_105">psychologist sits behind a screen. It is a good device... so that the psychologist can go to </div>
<div id="t16_105" class="t s1_105">sleep, can read a newspaper, or may even leave. And the patient goes on talking, </div>
