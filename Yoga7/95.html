<div id="t1_95" class="t s1_95">For Nietzsche himself, this realization that there is no personal God was too </div>
<div id="t2_95" class="t s1_95">much. He could not bear it: he went insane. He was not ready himself to </div>
<div id="t3_95" class="t s1_95">understand what insight had happened to him. He himself was childish; he </div>
<div id="t4_95" class="t s1_95">needed a personal God. But he meditated upon it, and as he meditated, the more </div>
<div id="t5_95" class="t s1_95">and more he became aware that that God is no longer there in the skies. It is </div>
<div id="t6_95" class="t s1_95">dead. And he also became aware that he has been killed by us. </div>
<div id="t7_95" class="t s1_95">Of course, if it was created by us, it has to be killed by us. The concept was </div>
<div id="t8_95" class="t s1_95">created by man in his childhood. In his maturity the concept is dropped -- as </div>
<div id="t9_95" class="t s1_95">when you were children you played with toys, then you became mature, and </div>
<div id="ta_95" class="t s1_95">you forgot all about those toys. Suddenly one day you come across in a corner of </div>
<div id="tb_95" class="t s1_95">the house, in the rubbish. An old toy. Then you remember how much you had </div>
<div id="tc_95" class="t s1_95">loved it, but now it is meaningless. It has to be thrown; you have changed. </div>
<div id="td_95" class="t s1_95">Man created the personal God, then man destroyed it. This realization was too </div>
<div id="te_95" class="t s1_95">much for Nietzsche himself; he became insane. His insanity is an indication that </div>
<div id="tf_95" class="t s1_95">he was not prepared for the insight that happened to him. </div>
<div id="tg_95" class="t s1_95">But, in the East, Patanjali is absolutely godless. You cannot find a greater atheist </div>
<div id="th_95" class="t s1_95">than Patanjali, but it does not disturb him because really he is a grown-up man, </div>
<div id="ti_95" class="t s1_95">really grown-up in consciousness, mature, integrated. For Buddha God doesn't </div>
<div id="tj_95" class="t s1_95">exist</div>
<div id="tk_95" class="t s1_95">....</div>
<div id="tl_95" class="t s1_95">If there is a personal God, he can forgive Friedrich Nietzsche because he will </div>
<div id="tm_95" class="t s1_95">understand that this man still needed him. That man Nietzsche was still divided, </div>
<div id="tn_95" class="t s1_95">confused -- half of his being was saying yes and half was saying no. If there is a </div>
<div id="to_95" class="t s1_95">personal God, he can even forgive Gautam Buddha because at least he denied </div>
<div id="tp_95" class="t s1_95">him. He said. "There is no God." That too is paying attention. But he will not be </div>
<div id="tq_95" class="t s1_95">able to forgive Patanjali. He used him. He not only not denied him, that he is not, </div>
<div id="tr_95" class="t s1_95">he used the very concept as a device. He said, "For the ultimate growth of man, </div>
<div id="ts_95" class="t s1_95">even the concept of God can be used as a hypothesis." Patanjali is absolutely cold </div>
<div id="tt_95" class="t s1_95">about God, colder than Gautam Buddha, because when you say no there is a </div>
<div id="tu_95" class="t s1_95">certain passion, when you say yes there is a certain passion -- in love, in hate, </div>
<div id="tv_95" class="t s1_95">there is passion. Patanjali is absolutely indifferent. He says, "Yes, the concept of </div>
<div id="tw_95" class="t s1_95">God can be used." He is the greatest atheist the world has ever known. </div>
<div id="tx_95" class="t s1_95">But in the West the concept of atheist is totally different. It is not yet mature. It is </div>
<div id="ty_95" class="t s1_95">on the same plane as the theist is. The theist goes on saying "there is a God" in </div>
<div id="tz_95" class="t s1_95">childish terminology, as a father, and the atheist goes on denying, that there is no </div>
<div id="t10_95" class="t s1_95">such God. They both exist on the same plane. Patanjali is the real atheist, but it </div>
<div id="t11_95" class="t s1_95">does not mean that he is irreligious. He is the really religious man. A really </div>
<div id="t12_95" class="t s1_95">religious man cannot believe in God. It will look like a paradox. </div>
<div id="t13_95" class="t s1_95">A really religious man cannot believe in God because to believe in God he has to </div>
<div id="t14_95" class="t s1_95">divide existence in two -- God and no God, the creator and the creation, this </div>
<div id="t15_95" class="t s1_95">world and that, matter and mind. He has to divide, and how can a religious man </div>
<div id="t16_95" class="t s1_95">divide? He does not believe in God; he comes to understand the very divinity of </div>
<div id="t17_95" class="t s1_95">existence. Then the whole existence is divine; then all that is there is divine. Then </div>
<div id="t18_95" class="t s1_95">every place is a temple, and wherever you move and whatsoever you do you are </div>
