<div id="t1_32" class="t s1_32">THE ELEPHANT HAULS HIMSELF FROM THE MUD. </div>
<div id="t2_32" class="t s1_32">IN THE SAME WAY DRAG YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR SLOTH. </div>
<div id="t3_32" class="t s1_32">The fundamental problem is not metaphysical, it is not concerned with the ultimate </div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s1_32">reality. It is concerned with you, your mind, your functioning of the mind, your sleep, </div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s1_32">your state of a sleepwalker. </div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s1_32">Man ordinarily exists only mechanically. He is not aware although he believes he is </div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s1_32">aware. In fact that belief hinders him from becoming aware. Man is fast asleep not only </div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s1_32">in the night but in the day too. He is constantly dreaming. You can watch it yourself. </div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s1_32">Any time close your eyes, relax a little and you will be surprised: dreams start moving. </div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s1_32">They were already moving like an undercurrent. You were occupied with outside </div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s1_32">reality, hence you were not looking at them, but they were there all the time. Your back </div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s1_32">was towards them. Just look a little in and you will find thousands of dreams crowding </div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s1_32">you: possible, impossible, consistent, inconsistent. </div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s1_32">When you see this state, you will understand why humanity has missed always the </div>
<div id="tf_32" class="t s1_32">awakened ones. The awakened one has no more any undercurrent of dreaming in him. </div>
<div id="tg_32" class="t s1_32">He is fully alert, aware. He speaks the language of awareness and you are asleep. There </div>
<div id="th_32" class="t s1_32">is no possibility of communication between you and the awakened one. He shouts, he </div>
<div id="ti_32" class="t s1_32">makes every effort to reach you, to penetrate you, to penetrate your sleep and </div>
<div id="tj_32" class="t s1_32">unconsciousness, but it is thick, dense and very deep. Rarely do you hear him, very </div>
<div id="tk_32" class="t s1_32">rarely, and even when you hear him you misinterpret him. Even when you hear him </div>
<div id="tl_32" class="t s1_32">you don't listen to him. You are like a drunk who seems to be hearing, but still goes on </div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s1_32">interpreting according to his drunken state. The whole humanity needs to be part of an </div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s1_32">organization like Alcoholics Anonymous. You may not be alcoholic, you may not be </div>
<div id="to_32" class="t s1_32">taking any intoxicant, you may not be taking or injecting any drug, but the society goes </div>
<div id="tp_32" class="t s1_32">on injecting into your blood, into your being, many poisons. </div>
<div id="tq_32" class="t s1_32">For example, each child is poisoned by the society through teaching him ambition. </div>
<div id="tr_32" class="t s1_32">Ambition is a poison far more dangerous than any alcohol can ever be, far more </div>
<div id="ts_32" class="t s1_32">dangerous than marijuana or LSD, because ambition destroys your whole life. It keeps </div>
<div id="tt_32" class="t s1_32">you moving in a false direction. It keeps you imagining, desiring, dreaming, it keeps </div>
<div id="tu_32" class="t s1_32">you wasting your life. Ambition means a subtle creation of the ego, and once the ego is </div>
<div id="tv_32" class="t s1_32">created you are in the grip of darkness. And the whole social structure depends on </div>
<div id="tw_32" class="t s1_32">ambition. Be the first! Wherever you are, whatsoever you are doing: be the first! -- as if </div>
<div id="tx_32" class="t s1_32">being the first has something divine about it. By what means you become the first is </div>
<div id="ty_32" class="t s1_32">irrelevant. By right means or wrong means, succeed! As if success in itself has become </div>
<div id="tz_32" class="t s1_32">equivalent to life, synonymous with life. </div>
<div id="t10_32" class="t s1_32">Life has nothing to do with success. Success keeps you rushing towards the future and </div>
<div id="t11_32" class="t s1_32">that becomes your intoxicant. Hoping, hoping for the tomorrow, wasting that which </div>
<div id="t12_32" class="t s1_32">you have or that which you don't have and will never have. </div>
<div id="t13_32" class="t s1_32">Rabinowitz walked into Gold's theatrical agency with a puppy under his arm. </div>
<div id="t14_32" class="t s1_32">"I got here an attraction that will make you a million dollars. I got a little puppy dog </div>
<div id="t15_32" class="t s1_32">that plays an electric piano and sings 'My Yiddish Mama'." </div>
