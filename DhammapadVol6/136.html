<div id="t2_136" class="t s1_136">Magdalene, was part of his company. He enjoyed the real people. </div>
<div id="t3_136" class="t s1_136">If you want to see the unreal people you can go to a meeting of the Rotary Club. There </div>
<div id="t4_136" class="t s1_136">you see pseudo people, all with masks, all smiling and saying hello to each other. These </div>
<div id="t5_136" class="t s1_136">are not their real faces, they always keep their real faces locked in their cupboards, they </div>
<div id="t6_136" class="t s1_136">never take them out. Only once in a while can you have a glimpse of their real face. It </div>
<div id="t7_136" class="t s1_136">happens only when they are unconscious; maybe when they have drunk too much you </div>
<div id="t8_136" class="t s1_136">can see their real face. The unconsciousness may give you a glimpse of their truth. </div>
<div id="t9_136" class="t s1_136">Gurdjieff used to give as much wine as possible to his new disciples; he would go on </div>
<div id="ta_136" class="t s1_136">forcing. And when the master forces you to drink</div>
<div id="tb_136" class="t s1_136">....</div>
<div id="tc_136" class="t s1_136">Just think of me asking you to </div>
<div id="td_136" class="t s1_136">drink, and I go on pouring and pouring -- how can you say no? And trust is the first </div>
<div id="te_136" class="t s1_136">thing. </div>
<div id="tf_136" class="t s1_136">Gurdjieff would force them to eat and drink so much that their real faces would show; </div>
<div id="tg_136" class="t s1_136">that was his first contact with the disciple. The disciples were very much puzzled, they </div>
<div id="th_136" class="t s1_136">had never seen such a master. They would fall on the ground and would start saying </div>
<div id="ti_136" class="t s1_136">incoherent things. Then Gurdjieff would sit by their side and listen to what they are </div>
<div id="tj_136" class="t s1_136">saying, what their faces are showing, because these are the real faces, these are their </div>
<div id="tk_136" class="t s1_136">realities. </div>
<div id="tl_136" class="t s1_136">You cannot think of Buddha telling people to drink, but Gurdjieff did. I cannot believe </div>
<div id="tm_136" class="t s1_136">that Jesus never laughed; he lived with such alive people: fishermen, carpenters, poor </div>
<div id="tn_136" class="t s1_136">people. He was not keeping company with the rabbis, the pundits, the scholars and the </div>
<div id="to_136" class="t s1_136">professors. He was moving with raw people, real people of the earth. It is impossible to </div>
<div id="tp_136" class="t s1_136">think that he was a sad man, that he never laughed; and if he was incapable of laughter, </div>
<div id="tq_136" class="t s1_136">he would be incapable of weeping too. </div>
<div id="tr_136" class="t s1_136">This statement, that he wept, shows with absolute certainty that he must have laughed </div>
<div id="ts_136" class="t s1_136">too. That is one of the most beautiful things about Jesus; I love that he is very human. </div>
<div id="tt_136" class="t s1_136">Buddha is a little cold, has no warmth, is far away -- that is his beauty. We need ALL </div>
<div id="tu_136" class="t s1_136">kinds of masters, we need ALL kinds of flowers in the garden. A rose has its beauty and </div>
<div id="tv_136" class="t s1_136">a lotus has its beauty. The lotus will need a lake, a different situation to happen in, it </div>
<div id="tw_136" class="t s1_136">will have a different fragrance. But all kinds of flowers enrich the garden. The garden of </div>
<div id="tx_136" class="t s1_136">buddhahood is full of strange, unique, incomparable beings: Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, </div>
<div id="ty_136" class="t s1_136">Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Krishna, Christ. </div>
<div id="tz_136" class="t s1_136">Now, Christ is on the cross. Whenever you think about Christ, you think of the cross </div>
<div id="t10_136" class="t s1_136">too. It is impossible to think of them separately, they have become inseparable. If you </div>
<div id="t11_136" class="t s1_136">see the cross you will think of Christ, if you think of Christ the cross is always there in </div>
<div id="t12_136" class="t s1_136">the background. With Krishna it is not the cross but the flute. Now, Krishna is a dancer, </div>
<div id="t13_136" class="t s1_136">a singer; you cannot think of Buddha dancing, singing, it is impossible to conceive. And </div>
<div id="t14_136" class="t s1_136">it will look very ridiculous too; with Krishna it fits, his whole vision of life is such that </div>
<div id="t15_136" class="t s1_136">the flute fits with it. </div>
<div id="t16_136" class="t s1_136">Remember this and don't become too much attached to one form of buddhahood. There </div>
<div id="t17_136" class="t s1_136">are as many forms of buddhahood as you can conceive. Many more buddhas will </div>
<div id="t18_136" class="t s1_136">happen in the future, who will have a totally different quality which was never </div>
