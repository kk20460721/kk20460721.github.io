<div id="t2_145" class="t s1_145">nothing but water. Then one day Columbus looked out at the horizon and saw trees. </div>
<div id="t3_145" class="t s1_145">And if you think Columbus was happy to see trees, you should have seen his dog! </div>
<div id="t4_145" class="t s1_145">That's why the Siberian dogs are the fastest in the world: because the trees are so far </div>
<div id="t5_145" class="t s1_145">apart. </div>
<div id="t6_145" class="t s1_145">But this is the world of pleasure. The dog can be forgiven, but you cannot be forgiven. </div>
<div id="t7_145" class="t s1_145">During their first date, the young man, looking for ways to have a good time, asked the </div>
<div id="t8_145" class="t s1_145">young lady if she would like to go bowling. She replied that she did not care to go </div>
<div id="t9_145" class="t s1_145">bowling. He then suggested a movie, but she answered that she did not care for them. </div>
<div id="ta_145" class="t s1_145">While trying to think of something else he offered her a cigarette which she declined. </div>
<div id="tb_145" class="t s1_145">He then asked if she would like to dance and drink at the new disco. She again declined </div>
<div id="tc_145" class="t s1_145">by saying she did not care for those things. </div>
<div id="td_145" class="t s1_145">In desperation he asked her to come to his apartment for a night of lovemaking. To his </div>
<div id="te_145" class="t s1_145">surprise she happily agreed, kissed him passionately and said, "You see, you don't need </div>
<div id="tf_145" class="t s1_145">any of those things to have a good time!" </div>
<div id="tg_145" class="t s1_145">It depends on people what can be called happiness. To the sleeping, pleasurable </div>
<div id="th_145" class="t s1_145">sensations are happiness. He lives from one pleasure to another pleasure. He is just </div>
<div id="ti_145" class="t s1_145">rushing from one sensation to another sensation. He lives for small thrills. His life is </div>
<div id="tj_145" class="t s1_145">very superficial; it has no depth, it has no quality. He lives in the world of quantity. </div>
<div id="tk_145" class="t s1_145">Then the people who are in between, who are neither asleep nor awake, who are just in </div>
<div id="tl_145" class="t s1_145">a limbo, a little bit asleep, a little bit awake. You sometimes have that experience in the </div>
<div id="tm_145" class="t s1_145">early morning: still sleepy, but you can't say you are asleep because you can hear the </div>
<div id="tn_145" class="t s1_145">noise in the house, your wife preparing tea, the noise of the samovar or the milkman at </div>
<div id="to_145" class="t s1_145">the door or children getting ready to go to school. You can hear these things, but still </div>
<div id="tp_145" class="t s1_145">you are not awake. Vaguely, dimly these noises reach to you, as if there is a great </div>
<div id="tq_145" class="t s1_145">distance between you and all that is happening around you. It feels as if it is still a part </div>
<div id="tr_145" class="t s1_145">of the dream. It is not a part of the dream, but you are in a state of in-between. </div>
<div id="ts_145" class="t s1_145">The same happens when you start meditating. The nonmeditator sleeps, dreams; the </div>
<div id="tt_145" class="t s1_145">meditator starts moving away from his sleep towards awakening. He is in a transitory </div>
<div id="tu_145" class="t s1_145">state. Then happiness has a totally different meaning: it becomes more of a quality, less </div>
<div id="tv_145" class="t s1_145">of a quantity; it is more psychological, less physiological. He enjoys music more, he </div>
<div id="tw_145" class="t s1_145">enjoys poetry more, he enjoys creating something. He enjoys nature, its beauty. He </div>
<div id="tx_145" class="t s1_145">enjoys silence. He enjoys what he had never enjoyed before, and this is far more lasting. </div>
<div id="ty_145" class="t s1_145">Even if the music stops, something goes on lingering in you. And it is not a relief. </div>
<div id="tz_145" class="t s1_145">The difference between pleasure and THIS happiness is: it is not a relief, it is an </div>
<div id="t10_145" class="t s1_145">enrichment. You become more full, you become a little overflowing. Listening to good </div>
<div id="t11_145" class="t s1_145">music, something is triggered in your being, a harmony arises in you -- you become </div>
<div id="t12_145" class="t s1_145">musical. Or dancing, suddenly you forget your body; your body becomes weightless. </div>
<div id="t13_145" class="t s1_145">The grip of gravitation over you is lost. Suddenly you are in a different space: the ego is </div>
<div id="t14_145" class="t s1_145">not so solid, the dancer melts and merges into the dance. This is far higher, far deeper </div>
