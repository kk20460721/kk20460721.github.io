<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">less it dominates, the less it forces itself upon you. </div>

<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">you become identified with it you go insane. If you condemn it, if you repress it, you go </div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">insane again. Avoid both the extremes. Keep yourself exactly in the middle, neither </div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">condemning nor identifying. Just be a pure witness. </div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">And slowly slowly, it will be healed. Slowly slowly, it will lose all its poison. Slowly </div>
<div id="t9_22" class="t s1_22">slowly, you will see it changing into a positive energy rather than a negative force. It </div>
<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">will become helpful. Each obsession is a knot in your being. Once it is opened, great </div>
<div id="tb_22" class="t s1_22">energy is released. </div>
<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">And everybody is carrying obsessions; our whole society is obsessive. A few obsessions </div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">are accepted by the people; then you don't call them obsessions. If they are not </div>
<div id="te_22" class="t s1_22">accepted, then they become obsessions. In one society one thing is thought to be </div>
<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">obsessive, in another society it is not obsessive. It may be even respected, may be </div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">thought saintly, holy. </div>
<div id="th_22" class="t s1_22">For a Jaina monk, to take a bath is an obsession. People who are taking baths every day </div>
<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">once or twice are obsessive; they are too much concerned about their body, body-</div>
<div id="tj_22" class="t s1_22">oriented. The Jaina monk condemns them. The Jaina monk does not take a bath. Jaina </div>
<div id="tk_22" class="t s1_22">monks used to come to see me. It was really a difficult time for me -- they stink! But </div>
<div id="tl_22" class="t s1_22">they think they are doing great austerity. </div>
<div id="tm_22" class="t s1_22">They don't clean their teeth either -- that too is an obsession. Morning, evening and </div>
<div id="tn_22" class="t s1_22">before you go to bed... and a few people will clean their teeth after each meal, so four, </div>
<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">five, six times a day. This IS obsession! You are madly concerned about your teeth. And </div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">all arguments that you can give are pointless to them because Jaina monks will say, </div>

<div id="tv_22" class="t s1_22">except a Jaina, nobody will think that these are obsessive things. </div>
<div id="tw_22" class="t s1_22">Remember one thing: that obsessions differ from society to society, from country to </div>
<div id="tx_22" class="t s1_22">country, from religion to religion. What is really obsession? Anything that becomes a </div>
<div id="ty_22" class="t s1_22">dominating force upon you, that dominates you, that becomes master of your being. </div>
<div id="tz_22" class="t s1_22">Anything that reduces you into a slave, that's my definition of an obsession. </div>
<div id="t10_22" class="t s1_22">Watch it, meditate. Be silently with it, because that is how you will become master </div>
<div id="t11_22" class="t s1_22">again. Silence makes you a master of everything. Don't fight, and don't become </div>
<div id="t12_22" class="t s1_22">identified. If you become identified you are mad. If you fight you are mad from the </div>

<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">The director of a well-known mental hospital decided to resign his post after many </div>
