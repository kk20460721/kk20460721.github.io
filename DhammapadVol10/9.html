<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">"Mister, it is not necessary for you to feel worried," she said kindly. "The operation was </div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">a big success. Take my word, when you leave here you will feel twenty years younger. </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">Maybe more, who knows?" </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">But the poor old man only continued to wail, the tears coursing down his cheeks and </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">losing themselves in his long white whiskers. </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">"Please don't cry," pleaded Mrs. Bernstein. "The pain will soon go away." </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">"Who is crying from pain?" sobbed the patient. "I am afraid I will be late for school." </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">Just look deep down inside yourself and you will find the child intact; it has not grown </div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s1_9">up. The ordinary mental age of every human being is not more than twelve. </div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">Physiologically you may be eighty; psychologically you are hanging around twelve. </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">Hence, once in a while, you start behaving like a child -- in spite of yourself. If you are </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">pushed and pulled too much you forget that you are a grown-up person. The child is </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">sitting there, covered by many experiences, but those experiences have not been </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">digested; covered by much knowledge, but that knowledge has not become your </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">wisdom because it has not been achieved through awareness. You have been collecting </div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s1_9">and accumulating it in your sleep, so you have accumulated much rubbish alongside. </div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s1_9">Yes, once in a while you may have picked up a diamond too, not knowing that it is a </div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s1_9">diamond -- just another colored stone. </div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s1_9">PLAY IN YOUR IMAGINATION WITH THEM AND THEY WILL SWEEP YOU </div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s1_9">AWAY. If you allow desire and pleasure and lust and greed and anger and jealousy and </div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s1_9">possessiveness and violence and all these rushing streams towards you, they will sweep </div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s1_9">you away. Don't play with them in your imagination; that is strengthening them, that is </div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s1_9">getting under their sway. </div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s1_9">And the miracle is that everybody can understand everybody else's imagination, except </div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s1_9">his own. When somebody falls in love with somebody else you say, "How foolish!" </div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s1_9">Everybody thinks they have gone crazy. "Look at the face of that woman. She looks like </div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s1_9">a Picasso painting! And why is this man crazy about her? What does he see in her?" </div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s1_9">And when YOU fall in love, then it is totally different. She is a Cleopatra! Nobody else </div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">will agree with you; it is your imagination. And the same goes on and on in different </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">layers, in different dimensions. </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">The nonsense that is written in your religious scriptures is absolutely right; it is </div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s1_9">scientific. The nonsense that is written in others' scriptures is so clearly nonsense; there </div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s1_9">can be no question about it, no doubt about it. Hindus can see all kinds of stupidities in </div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s1_9">the Bible, and Christians see all kinds of stupidities in Hindu scriptures. But this seems </div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s1_9">to be really a miracle: that no Hindu will see in his own scriptures anything wrong; </div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s1_9">everything is scientific. And not only does he think it is scientific, he tries to prove it. </div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s1_9">Once a Hindu monk was brought to me. He came with many followers. One of his </div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s1_9">followers said, "He is a very great scholar; he has written many books. And his whole </div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s1_9">effort in his life has been to prove that Hinduism is the only scientific religion of the </div>
<div id="t14_9" class="t s1_9">world." </div>
<div id="t15_9" class="t s1_9">I said, "Can he give any example?" </div>
