<div id="t1_12" class="t s1_12">DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO RESOLUTELY, WITH ALL YOUR HEART. Remember </div>
<div id="t2_12" class="t s1_12">the emphasis on the heart. Mind can never be one; by its very nature it is many. And the </div>
<div id="t3_12" class="t s1_12">heart is always one; by its very nature it cannot be many. You cannot have many hearts </div>
<div id="t4_12" class="t s1_12">but you can have many minds. Why? -- because the mind lives in doubt and the heart </div>
<div id="t5_12" class="t s1_12">lives in love. The mind lives in doubt and the heart lives in trust. The heart knows how </div>
<div id="t6_12" class="t s1_12">to trust; it is trust that makes it one. When you trust, suddenly you become centered. </div>
<div id="t7_12" class="t s1_12">Hence the significance of trust. It does not matter whether your trust is in the right </div>
<div id="t8_12" class="t s1_12">person or not. It does not matter whether your trust will be exploited or not. It does not </div>
<div id="t9_12" class="t s1_12">matter whether you will be deceived because of your trust or not. There is every </div>
<div id="ta_12" class="t s1_12">possibility you may be deceived -- the world is full of deceivers. What matters is that </div>
<div id="tb_12" class="t s1_12">you trusted. It is out of your trust that you become integrated, which is far more </div>
<div id="tc_12" class="t s1_12">important than anything else. It is not a question that first you have to be certain </div>
<div id="td_12" class="t s1_12">whether the person is worthy of trust or not. How will you be certain? And who will </div>
<div id="te_12" class="t s1_12">inquire? </div>
<div id="tf_12" class="t s1_12">It will be the mind, and the mind knows only how to doubt. It will doubt. It will doubt </div>
<div id="tg_12" class="t s1_12">even a man like Christ or Buddha. It can't help. </div>
<div id="th_12" class="t s1_12">Judas doubted Jesus. He could not trust -- even a man like Jesus. And Jesus trusted </div>
<div id="ti_12" class="t s1_12">Judas; he could not doubt even a man like Judas. See the point. Who is the gainer? If </div>
<div id="tj_12" class="t s1_12">you superficially look, then it seems Jesus has lost because he is crucified. If he had not </div>
<div id="tk_12" class="t s1_12">trusted Judas he would have saved his life. But that is only a superficial understanding. </div>
<div id="tl_12" class="t s1_12">In fact the loser is Judas, not Jesus. One has to die some day or other, and one cannot die </div>
<div id="tm_12" class="t s1_12">a better death than Jesus. It is his death that brought a revolution into the consciousness </div>
<div id="tn_12" class="t s1_12">of humanity. </div>
<div id="to_12" class="t s1_12">If Buddha had also been crucified we would have been far richer. Dying on a bed </div>
<div id="tp_12" class="t s1_12">would not have been of much help. And what difference does it make to Jesus where he </div>
<div id="tq_12" class="t s1_12">dies? But a man like Jesus uses even his death as a situation, as a device. He used it and </div>
<div id="tr_12" class="t s1_12">he used it very skillfully. Socrates could not use his death so skillfully. Maybe it is </div>
<div id="ts_12" class="t s1_12">because of Socrates' death that Jesus has learned a lesson: how to use death. There are </div>
<div id="tt_12" class="t s1_12">foolish people who cannot use their lives usefully, artistically, gracefully, beautifully, </div>
<div id="tu_12" class="t s1_12">and there are people like Jesus who can even use their death. Their death is also a </div>
<div id="tv_12" class="t s1_12">device. </div>
<div id="tw_12" class="t s1_12">The real loser is Judas, and he understood immediately. When Jesus was crucified he </div>
<div id="tx_12" class="t s1_12">felt so ashamed that he committed suicide the next day. Now, committing suicide is </div>
<div id="ty_12" class="t s1_12">ugly; being crucified has a beauty. It is a sacrifice, the ultimate sacrifice, the ultimate </div>
<div id="tz_12" class="t s1_12">offering one can make to God. And Jesus made it. His last words were, "Thy kingdom </div>
<div id="t10_12" class="t s1_12">come, thy will be done." He surrendered totally: "Let thy kingdom come." He effaced </div>
<div id="t11_12" class="t s1_12">himself totally, he dropped his ego totally: "Thy will be done." He trusted Judas </div>
<div id="t12_12" class="t s1_12">absolutely. He hugged him, he kissed him, he washed his feet. He knew that the man </div>
<div id="t13_12" class="t s1_12">was going to betray him -- and still his trust was total. </div>
<div id="t14_12" class="t s1_12">So remember, trust does not mean that first you have to inquire, that first you have to </div>
<div id="t15_12" class="t s1_12">make everything certain, guaranteed, and then you trust. That is not trust, that is really </div>
<div id="t16_12" class="t s1_12">doubt: because you have no more possibilities to doubt, hence you trust. If another </div>
<div id="t17_12" class="t s1_12">possibility arises of doubt you will doubt again. Trust is in spite of all the doubts, in </div>
