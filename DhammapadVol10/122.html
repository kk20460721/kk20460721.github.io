<div id="t1_122" class="t s1_122">J. Krishnamurti was brought up by theosophists. He was fed, spoon-fed with all kinds </div>
<div id="t2_122" class="t s1_122">of occultism. He became so fed up that when the theosophists were going to declare </div>
<div id="t3_122" class="t s1_122">him to be the world teacher</div>
<div id="t4_122" class="t s1_122">....</div>
<div id="t5_122" class="t s1_122">The day they had gathered from all over the world -- six </div>
<div id="t6_122" class="t s1_122">thousand leading theosophists -- when they asked Krishnamurti to declare, he stood up </div>
<div id="t7_122" class="t s1_122">and said, "I dissolve this organization. I am nobody's teacher. I am finished with it all, </div>
<div id="t8_122" class="t s1_122">and I don't want to say anything more!" </div>
<div id="t9_122" class="t s1_122">They were shocked, but as far as I see it, it is a logical conclusion. For years he was </div>
<div id="ta_122" class="t s1_122">taught all kinds of nonsense by all kinds of stupid people. He was getting fed up with </div>
<div id="tb_122" class="t s1_122">the whole thing. But old ladies, and particularly retired old people, were very </div>
<div id="tc_122" class="t s1_122">interested. They were the majority of the theosophists -- retired people and old ladies </div>
<div id="td_122" class="t s1_122">who now had nothing else to do -- and they would gather and talk nonsense about </div>
<div id="te_122" class="t s1_122">ghosts and about Tibetan masters who come flying in the air, and about letters that </div>
<div id="tf_122" class="t s1_122">Master K.H</div>
<div id="tg_122" class="t s1_122">....</div>
<div id="th_122" class="t s1_122">Now nobody knows who this K.H. is. His full name is Koot Humi. That </div>
<div id="ti_122" class="t s1_122">too, nobody knows what it means. The less you understand, the better. </div>
<div id="tj_122" class="t s1_122">Koot Humi -- in short K.H. -- used to write letters, until finally it was found that those </div>
<div id="tk_122" class="t s1_122">letters were written by Blavatsky herself. A servant used to hide on the roof -- just think, </div>
<div id="tl_122" class="t s1_122">just on the roof of Buddha Hall! -- and there was a small hole from where, when the </div>
<div id="tm_122" class="t s1_122">theosophists would be sitting with closed eyes waiting for Koot Humi, he would drop a </div>
<div id="tn_122" class="t s1_122">letter. </div>
<div id="to_122" class="t s1_122">Now, people are so foolish</div>
<div id="tp_122" class="t s1_122">....</div>
<div id="tq_122" class="t s1_122">Just ordinary paper -- they could have seen what brand it </div>
<div id="tr_122" class="t s1_122">was, in what factory it had been made -- ordinary ink, and the handwriting was </div>
<div id="ts_122" class="t s1_122">Blavatsky's. Then the letter would be read, and those letters were collected, and they </div>
<div id="tt_122" class="t s1_122">were great treasures. But in the High Court there was a case against one of the great </div>
<div id="tu_122" class="t s1_122">theosophists, Leadbeater. He was a colleague of Annie Besant, and he was suspected of </div>
<div id="tv_122" class="t s1_122">homosexuality. Just a dirty old man, that's all! </div>
<div id="tw_122" class="t s1_122">So there was a case in the High Court against him, and in that case his servant </div>
<div id="tx_122" class="t s1_122">confessed that he was the man who used to hide on the roof. He went and showed the </div>
<div id="ty_122" class="t s1_122">hole and the place where he used to hide, and everything was discovered. Still, people </div>
<div id="tz_122" class="t s1_122">go on reading those letters believing that Koot Humi wrote them. </div>
<div id="t10_122" class="t s1_122">When people WANT to believe, when they are feeling empty, some belief is needed. </div>
<div id="t11_122" class="t s1_122">They cling to anything, they don't listen... they don't listen to their own heart. They just </div>
<div id="t12_122" class="t s1_122">need belief; so anybody is ready to supply it. Wherever there is demand there is supply. </div>
<div id="t13_122" class="t s1_122">People need fictions, so there are other people -- clever, cunning people -- who go on </div>
<div id="t14_122" class="t s1_122">supplying fictions. </div>
<div id="t15_122" class="t s1_122">In a Catholic school, little Hans was asked to give an example of a dependent clause. </div>
<div id="t16_122" class="t s1_122">"Our cat has a litter of ten kittens," he replied, "all of which are good Catholics." </div>
<div id="t17_122" class="t s1_122">"That's excellent," said the teacher. "You have a good grasp on grammar as well as on </div>
<div id="t18_122" class="t s1_122">our religion." </div>
<div id="t19_122" class="t s1_122">The following week the bishop visited the school and the teacher called on Hans. </div>
<div id="t1a_122" class="t s1_122">"Our cat has a litter of ten kittens," said Hans, "all of which are good sannyasins." </div>
<div id="t1b_122" class="t s1_122">"That is not what you said a week ago!" snapped the teacher. </div>
<div id="t1c_122" class="t s1_122">"Yes," replied Hans, "but my kittens' eyes are open now." </div>
