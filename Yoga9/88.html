<div id="t1_88" class="t s1_88">But try to understand the base of miserliness. It is in the idea of living somewhere in the </div>
<div id="t2_88" class="t s1_88">future. If you are to live herenow, you are never miserly, because you can share. For what </div>
<div id="t3_88" class="t s1_88">to collect anything? For what to accumulate? There is no necessity that the tomorrow is </div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s1_88">going to be; it may not be. Why not share? Why not enjoy? This very moment life is </div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s1_88">flowering in you. Enjoy it, share it. Because by sharing, it becomes intense. By sharing, it </div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s1_88">becomes more vital. By sharing, it increases and grows. </div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s1_88">So the whole point is to understand that the future is not. The future is created by the </div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s1_88">ambitious mind. The future is not part of time. It is part of ambition. Because ambition </div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s1_88">needs space to move. You cannot fulfill ambition now. You can fulfill life now, but not </div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">ambition. Ambition is against life, antilife. </div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">Just see yourself and others. People are preparing: someday they are going to live. That </div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s1_88">day never comes. They go on preparing, and they die. It will never come because, if you </div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s1_88">get into preparations too much, that will become an obsession. You will simply prepare </div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s1_88">and prepare and prepare. It is as if somebody goes on accumulating foodstuff for some </div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s1_88">future use and goes on remaining hungry, starving, and dying. That's what is happening </div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s1_88">to millions of people. They die, surrounded by much stuff which could have been used. </div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s1_88">They could have lived beautifully. </div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s1_88">Nobody is hindering your path except your ambition. </div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s1_88">So miserliness is part of ambition. </div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s1_88">This question is from Bodhidharma. He is very ambitious. Not in a worldly sense -- he </div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s1_88">does not want a big house, he does not want a big car, he does not want a big bank </div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s1_88">account -- no, he is simple that way, very simple, almost a mahatma. He has nothing </div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s1_88">much and he does not bother about it. But he wants to be enlightened. That's his problem. </div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s1_88">And he is in such a hurry to become enlightened. </div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s1_88">Drop all nonsense. Live right now. There is no need for any enlightenment in the future. </div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s1_88">If you live right now, you are enlightened. The day you will be able to find out that life </div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s1_88">has to be lived right now, here-now, you are enlightened. Then one never thinks of the </div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s1_88">past and never thinks of the future. This moment is enough, enough unto itself. All </div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s1_88">misery disappears. </div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s1_88">Misery is because you are not capable of living. So you create some goals -- </div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s1_88">enlightenment is a goal to give you a feeling that you are important, that you are doing </div>
<div id="tw_88" class="t s1_88">something, your life is meaningful, you are not living a meaningless life, you are a great </div>
<div id="tx_88" class="t s1_88">spiritual seeker. All ego trips. </div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s1_88">Enlightenment is not a goal. It is a consequence. You cannot seek it. You cannot make a </div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">goal out of it. It cannot become an object of desire. When you start living desirelessly, </div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s1_88">here-now, suddenly it is there. It is a consequence. It is a consequence of a vital life, of an </div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s1_88">alive being -- so alive and so intense, so aflame, that this moment he moves so deeply </div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s1_88">into time that he touches eternity. </div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s1_88">There are two moments in time. One is from one moment to another, horizontal -- from A </div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s1_88">to B, from B to C, from C to D. That's how you live; that's how desire moves -- </div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s1_88">horizontal. A really alive man, sensitive, aware, does not move from A to B. He moves </div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s1_88">deeper into A and deeper into A and deeper and deeper and deeper; his movement is </div>
<div id="t17_88" class="t s1_88">vertical. </div>
<div id="t18_88" class="t s1_88">This is the meaning of Jesus' cross. The cross is both vertical and horizontal. Jesus' hands </div>
<div id="t19_88" class="t s1_88">are on the horizontal part of the cross. His whole body is on the vertical. Hands are </div>
<div id="t1a_88" class="t s1_88">symbolic of action; action moves horizontally. Being moves vertically. </div>
