<div id="t1_59" class="t s1_59">But one thing I would like to say: all madnesses are not breakthroughs. But every </div>
<div id="t2_59" class="t s1_59">madness can be transformed into a breakthrough -- and that should be the work of the </div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s1_59">therapist. Even if the madness is a breakdown, the function of the therapist is to help </div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">the breakdown to be transformed into a breakthrough. Otherwise, what is your </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">purpose? What are you doing? </div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s1_59">Up to now, the function of the therapist has been to normalize the person, to bring him </div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s1_59">back to his old self. And what was his old self in the first place? It is his old self that has </div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s1_59">brought this state of madness. If you bring him back to the old self you are simply </div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s1_59">postponing the same thing happening again. Sooner or later he will again become mad. </div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s1_59">Maybe you are helping him for temporary relief. Unless his breakdown becomes a </div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s1_59">breakthrough you have not been a real help to him. </div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s1_59">My methods of meditation are methods for future psychotherapy. The orthodox, the </div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">ordinary psychiatrists will be against my methods, because they cling to the old idea. </div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s1_59">They are afraid of the breakdown -- I am not afraid of the breakdown. Breakdown </div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s1_59">simply means the change has started. Breakdown simply means all the old strategies, all </div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s1_59">the old securities, have failed. Breakdown simply means that your old personality is of </div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s1_59">no use anymore. You need a new being, a new birth. </div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s1_59">When the child is born out of the womb he must be thinking -- if he can think -- that this </div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s1_59">is a breakdown, because his whole world is disappearing. The womb, its coziness, its </div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s1_59">warmth, its safety, security -- no worry, no responsibility -- all that is disappearing. And </div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s1_59">the child has to pass such a narrow passage, he must be feeling that he is dying. And </div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s1_59">then he has to learn a new way of life from ABC. It takes twenty-five years for us to </div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s1_59">educate him to function rightly in the society. </div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s1_59">But our society is abnormal, our society is neurotic. It has been dominated by neurotic </div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s1_59">politicians, neurotic priests, for centuries. So we convert each child into a neurotic -- </div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s1_59">Hindu neurotics, Mohammedan neurotics, Christian neurotics. We change every child </div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s1_59">into a fanatic, and the more fanatic he is the more we praise him. The more he says, </div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s1_59">"Hinduism is the only religion, the only right religion, the only true religion," Hindus </div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s1_59">will praise him. </div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s1_59">That's how Ayatollah Khomeini is being praised by foolish people in Iran. He is a </div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s1_59">lunatic -- he needs a breakdown! -- but he is being praised as a great leader, a </div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s1_59">revolutionary leader. Down the centuries, fanatics have been praised. </div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s1_59">If somebody says, "India is the greatest country in the world, the most religious, the </div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s1_59">most sacred land," people will praise him. They will say, "Look how devoted he is to the </div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s1_59">country." He is simply mad -- he needs therapy! </div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s1_59">Because we have praised these kinds of neurotic attitudes, approaches, and we have </div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s1_59">condemned others... if somebody does not praise Mohammedanism, Hinduism, </div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s1_59">Christianity, we think he is a traitor. If somebody is not a great nationalist we think he </div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s1_59">is a traitor. We have condemned the sane people and we have praised the insane. </div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s1_59">Naturally, the crowd has remained insane. </div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s1_59">The whole world needs a breakdown! But just a breakdown is not going to help. Before </div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s1_59">the world goes through that breakdown -- and the day is coming closer every day -- </div>
