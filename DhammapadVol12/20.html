<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">been changing the objects of my desire, but I have not dropped desiring. Instead of </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">money, now I desire enlightenment. Instead of power, now I desire ultimate truth. But </div>

<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">the whole ridiculousness of the effort. </div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">Spiritual effort is more ridiculous than the worldly effort. The worldly effort has a </div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">certain relevance, but the spiritual effort has no relevance. </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">He relaxed -- obviously, naturally. Not that he made an effort to relax: relaxation came </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">to him because there was nothing to achieve, nowhere to go. Relaxation simply came to </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">him; from the beyond something descended. He fell into deep rest. </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">That night he slept for the first time without dreams. When there are no desires there </div>

<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">you are desiring impossible things; hence your night is disturbed, your sleep is </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">disturbed. There is no rest; it is feverish, it is pathological, it is not healthy. For the first </div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">time in his life he relaxed and slept well, totally, like a small child newly born. </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">Deeply rested, in the morning when he opened his eyes the last star was disappearing </div>

<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">enough to keep you tense. Relaxation cannot be a "must," it cannot be an effort. </div>

<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">from insomnia this is the sure method to suffer from insomnia. Try, make an effort to go </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">into sleep. Toss and turn and take long breaths and count sheep and jog in the room </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s1_20">and take a bath and do some Transcendental Meditation. And then naturally sleep will </div>
