<div id="t6_143" class="t s1_143">towards the spiritual nourishment. </div>

<div id="te_143" class="t s1_143">the stuff called bliss. </div>
<div id="tf_143" class="t s1_143">That's what Buddha means when he says: AES DHAMMO SANANTANO -- this is the </div>

<div id="t10_143" class="t s1_143">But Mahavira never became tired and Buddha became tired after six years. What was </div>
<div id="t11_143" class="t s1_143">the matter? And he attained as much as Buddha attained. Buddha attained by dropping </div>
<div id="t12_143" class="t s1_143">his fasting and austerity; Mahavira never dropped it. Now, both cannot be right -- and I </div>
<div id="t13_143" class="t s1_143">say to you both are right. But the reasons are so different, almost inconceivable. </div>
<div id="t14_143" class="t s1_143">Mahavira's fast has a totally different quality. He is not an ascetic, he is not fasting -- in </div>
<div id="t15_143" class="t s1_143">fact, he is eating so much of God that he does not feel the need to eat. His soul is so </div>
