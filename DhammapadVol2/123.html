<div id="t2_123" class="t s1_123">ultimate as your innermost being, your interiority. </div>
<div id="t3_123" class="t s1_123">Yes, you have been told to be respectful to yourself because you don't know who you </div>
<div id="t4_123" class="t s1_123">are. You have been told to feel worthwhile because you feel worthless. You have been </div>
<div id="t5_123" class="t s1_123">told to love yourself because you hate yourself. And the strange thing is, the irony is, </div>
<div id="t6_123" class="t s1_123">that it is the SAME people who have been doing both things to you. </div>
<div id="t7_123" class="t s1_123">The same people first make you feel worthless; this is the trade secret of all the </div>
<div id="t8_123" class="t s1_123">churches, of all the so-called religions, of all political ideologies, of all societies, </div>
<div id="t9_123" class="t s1_123">civilizations and cultures that have existed up to now. This is the trade secret: first they </div>
<div id="ta_123" class="t s1_123">make you feel worthless -- every child is made to feel worthless. He is told, "Unless you </div>
<div id="tb_123" class="t s1_123">become this or that, you have no worth." When he starts feeling worthless, than we start </div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s1_123">telling him, "Feel worthwhile, feel some worth. If you cannot feel worthwhile, your life </div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s1_123">is wasted." </div>
<div id="te_123" class="t s1_123">First we tell him to hate himself and condemn himself; everything that he does is </div>
<div id="tf_123" class="t s1_123">wrong, hence he starts hating himself because he is not a beautiful person. The parents, </div>
<div id="tg_123" class="t s1_123">the teachers, the priests, they are all joined in the conspiracy. Every child is reduced to </div>
<div id="th_123" class="t s1_123">such a condemnable state that he starts feeling, "I must be the ugliest person in the </div>
<div id="ti_123" class="t s1_123">world, because I do things that should not be done, and I don't do things which should </div>
<div id="tj_123" class="t s1_123">be done." And then one day we start telling the child, "Why don't you love yourself? </div>
<div id="tk_123" class="t s1_123">Otherwise, how will you survive?" </div>
<div id="tl_123" class="t s1_123">We take all respect away from the child, and when he becomes disrespectful towards </div>
<div id="tm_123" class="t s1_123">himself we start telling him to create respect. This is such an absurd situation! Each </div>
<div id="tn_123" class="t s1_123">child is born with great respect for himself. Each child knows his worth, his intrinsic </div>
<div id="to_123" class="t s1_123">worth. He is not worthy because he is like Buddha or Krishna or Christ -- he simply </div>
<div id="tp_123" class="t s1_123">knows he has worth because he is, he has being. That's enough! And each child loves </div>
<div id="tq_123" class="t s1_123">himself, respects himself. </div>
<div id="tr_123" class="t s1_123">It is you who teach him just the opposite. First you destroy all that is beautiful in him, </div>
<div id="ts_123" class="t s1_123">and then you start painting a false picture. Destroy the natural beauty and then paint </div>
<div id="tt_123" class="t s1_123">his face, make him absolutely false. But why is this done? -- because only false people </div>
<div id="tu_123" class="t s1_123">can be slaves, only false people can follow the stupid politicians, only false people can </div>
<div id="tv_123" class="t s1_123">be victims of utterly ignorant priests. If people are real, they cannot be exploited and </div>
<div id="tw_123" class="t s1_123">cannot be oppressed. </div>
<div id="tx_123" class="t s1_123">Aradhana, remain confused -- it is good. It is good that you have come to this point </div>
<div id="ty_123" class="t s1_123">where a great confusion has arisen in you. You can no longer trust your ego -- good! It </div>
<div id="tz_123" class="t s1_123">is tremendously important, because now a second step becomes possible. I will give </div>

<div id="t11_123" class="t s1_123">natural love, which is not cultivated; your spontaneous respect, which arises only when </div>
<div id="t12_123" class="t s1_123">you start feeling that you are part of God, that you are divine. </div>
<div id="t13_123" class="t s1_123">Remember, ego is comparative -- it always compares itself with others -- and the self is </div>
<div id="t14_123" class="t s1_123">noncomparative. When you know yourself it is neither inferior nor superior in </div>
<div id="t15_123" class="t s1_123">comparison to anybody, it is simply itself. But the ego is comparative. And remember, if </div>
<div id="t16_123" class="t s1_123">you feel superior to somebody, you are bound to feel inferior to somebody else. So the </div>
<div id="t17_123" class="t s1_123">ego is a very tricky phenomenon: on the one hand it makes you feel superior, on the </div>
