<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">CHAPTER 2. IT AIN’T EASY!</div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s2_40">A strange answer – one in a hundred? But that’s how it has always been. When you have a hundred</div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s2_40">disciples only one is really a disciple. Ninety-nine are just hangers-around.</div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s2_40">Even a great poet, when he writes poetry, ninety-nine times writes only shopping lists. Only once</div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s2_40">in a while the poetry happens – all poetries are not poetic. And sometimes this too happens, that a</div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s2_40">shopping list may have great poetry. All shopping lists are not necessarily unpoetic.</div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s2_40">But Deborah must belong to the new kind of woman that is arising in the world, the lib woman.</div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s2_40">One thing has to be understood: the liberation movement that is going on in the world is a man-</div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s2_40">created phenomenon, a male-created phenomenon. You will be surprised about it, that it is again a</div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s2_40">male conspiracy. Now man wants to get rid of women. He wants to have no responsibility. He wants</div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s2_40">to enjoy women but only as fun; he does not want to take all the other responsibilities that come with</div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s2_40">it.</div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s2_40">Now, this is a subtle conspiracy: the man is trying to persuade women all over the world that the</div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s2_40">woman has to become independent. It is a subtle trick. And the male mind is cunning and the male</div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s2_40">mind is succeeding. And now many women have become poisoned by this idea.</div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s2_40">Do you know? The ﬁrst persons who started talking about equality between man and woman were</div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s2_40">men, not women. The ﬁrst persons who started talking about it, that they should have equal freedom,</div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s2_40">were men, not women. The seed comes from the male mind. And it has always been so – whenever</div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s2_40">a man feels what is in his favour, he manages it. His cunning is very subtle. And sometimes he</div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s2_40">manages it in such a way that the woman thinks she is doing it on her own.</div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s2_40">In the past also it has been so. Man has persuaded women in the past that they are pure beings,</div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s2_40">angels. Man is dirty, boys are boys – but the woman? She is divine. Man has put woman on a high</div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s2_40">pedestal; that was his trick to control woman. Man has worshipped, and through worship he has</div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s2_40">controlled. And naturally, when the woman was on the pedestal she thought that she was something</div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s2_40">divine – she could not do those things that men are doing, she could not, because that was going</div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s2_40">against her ego. That high pedestal was very ego-satisfying. She was the mother, she was divine;</div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s2_40">she had more divine qualities than man. Man is ugly, immoral, and all that. Man has to be forgiven</div>
<div id="ts_40" class="t s2_40">for that.</div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s2_40">So man, down the ages, started remaining in his ways. And the woman was high. But this was a</div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s2_40">trick, the ego was persuaded. And once your ego is persuaded, you are caught. Then you cannot</div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s2_40">move from your posture. To ask for equality will be a kind of fall – you will have to come down to</div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s2_40">become equal. It was a strategy, and the woman followed it. She remained pure, she remained</div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s2_40">virgin up to the marriage.</div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s2_40">It was not so for the man. If the woman died, the man was allowed to marry again – because boys</div>
<div id="tz_40" class="t s2_40">are boys, they cannot live without the woman. If the man died, the woman had to remain a widow for</div>
<div id="t10_40" class="t s2_40">her whole life. Or, in this country particularly – which did this strategy to the very logical end – she</div>
<div id="t11_40" class="t s2_40">had to commit suicide. She had to burn herself alive with the husband. And millions of women did</div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s2_40">it. How were they persuaded? And do you think they were forced? No, nobody was forcing them.</div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s2_40">There was no visible coercion, just a very deep seduction. By becoming SATIS, by going into the</div>
<div id="t14_40" class="t s2_40">ﬁre with the husband, their egos were fulﬁlled. Greatly fulﬁlled – people worshipped them. When</div>
