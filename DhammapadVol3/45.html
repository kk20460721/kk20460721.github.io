<div id="t1_45" class="t s1_45">By the evening when she came she was a totally different woman -- she came laughing. </div>
<div id="t2_45" class="t s1_45">In the morning she had come crying and weeping; she was almost mad because the </div>
<div id="t3_45" class="t s1_45">only son had died. Buddha asked her, "Why are you smiling?" </div>
<div id="t4_45" class="t s1_45">She said, "Now I know -- you tricked me, you befooled me, but I could not see the point </div>
<div id="t5_45" class="t s1_45">at that time. Everybody has to die, so it is not a question now that my son has died. He </div>
<div id="t6_45" class="t s1_45">had to die one day or other. And it is good, in a way, that he has died before me: if I had </div>
<div id="t7_45" class="t s1_45">died before him, he would have suffered. It is better for me to suffer than for him to </div>
<div id="t8_45" class="t s1_45">suffer. So it is good, perfectly good. </div>
<div id="t9_45" class="t s1_45">"Now I have come for initiation. Initiate me into sannyas, because I would like to know: </div>
<div id="ta_45" class="t s1_45">is there anything beyond death or not? Is death all or does something survive? I am no </div>
<div id="tb_45" class="t s1_45">longer interested in the son." </div>
<div id="tc_45" class="t s1_45">Buddha said, "That was the purpose of sending you, so that you can be awakened." </div>
<div id="td_45" class="t s1_45">Now the same story you can visualize about Jesus Christ. What Christians say... because </div>
<div id="te_45" class="t s1_45">nobody knows what kind of man Jesus really was except what the Christians say about </div>
<div id="tf_45" class="t s1_45">him, and they are saying wrong things about him. If he was really a buddha -- and he </div>
<div id="tg_45" class="t s1_45">was -- then he would not have been interested in reviving people from death. He would </div>
<div id="th_45" class="t s1_45">not revive Lazarus from death -- what is the point? Lazarus is no longer alive. He must </div>
<div id="ti_45" class="t s1_45">have died a few years later; even if he was revived he would have died a few years </div>
<div id="tj_45" class="t s1_45">later. Death is going to happen; you can at the most postpone it. </div>
<div id="tk_45" class="t s1_45">A buddha is not interested in postponing! A buddha's whole effort is to make you alert, </div>
<div id="tl_45" class="t s1_45">aware, that death is coming. He is not to protect you from death, he has to take you </div>
<div id="tm_45" class="t s1_45">beyond death. And Jesus is a buddha. MY understanding of Jesus is totally different </div>
<div id="tn_45" class="t s1_45">from the Christian interpretation. To me, this is a parable: Lazarus coming back to life </div>
<div id="to_45" class="t s1_45">simply means Lazarus reborn spiritually. </div>
<div id="tp_45" class="t s1_45">Buddha has said many times -- Jesus has said also -- Unless you are born again, you will </div>
<div id="tq_45" class="t s1_45">not enter into my Kingdom of God. But "born again" does not mean that you have to be </div>
<div id="tr_45" class="t s1_45">resurrected. "Born again" means a spiritual process of awakening. Jesus must have </div>
<div id="ts_45" class="t s1_45">awakened Lazarus from his sleep, from his metaphysical death. </div>
<div id="tt_45" class="t s1_45">When you come to me you are metaphysically dead -- you are Lazarus. The story says </div>
<div id="tu_45" class="t s1_45">Jesus called Lazarus out of his tomb: "Lazarus, come out!" That's what every buddha </div>
<div id="tv_45" class="t s1_45">has been doing down the ages: calling Lazaruses to come out of their graves. When I </div>
<div id="tw_45" class="t s1_45">initiate you into sannyas, what am I doing? -- calling, "Lazarus, come out of your grave! </div>
<div id="tx_45" class="t s1_45">Be reborn!" </div>
<div id="ty_45" class="t s1_45">Sannyas is a process of rebirth. Lazarus must have been initiated into the deeper </div>
<div id="tz_45" class="t s1_45">mysteries of life which go beyond death. But to make this beautiful metaphor into an </div>
<div id="t10_45" class="t s1_45">historical event is to destroy the whole poetry of it, the whole significance of it. </div>
<div id="t11_45" class="t s1_45">A buddha will not ask -- for himself or for his family or for anybody else -- for power, </div>
<div id="t12_45" class="t s1_45">prestige, possessions, because they are utterly useless. </div>
<div id="t13_45" class="t s1_45">CAN A WISE MAN WISH TO RISE UNJUSTLY? That's impossible. Remember, the </div>
<div id="t14_45" class="t s1_45">"wise man" is a translation of 'buddha'. An awakened man cannot do anything unjust -- </div>
<div id="t15_45" class="t s1_45">it is impossible, it can't happen in the nature of things. The awakened one can do only </div>
