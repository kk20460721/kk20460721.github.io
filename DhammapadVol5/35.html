<div id="t5_35" class="t s1_35">religious search was also concerned with an object of desire, as much as the worldly </div>
<div id="t6_35" class="t s1_35">search was. The worldly man sought money, power, prestige, and the otherworldly </div>
<div id="t7_35" class="t s1_35">man was seeking God, heaven, eternity, truth. But one thing was common: both were </div>
<div id="t8_35" class="t s1_35">looking outside themselves, both were extroverts. Remember this word, because this is </div>
<div id="t9_35" class="t s1_35">going to help you understand Buddha. </div>
<div id="ta_35" class="t s1_35">Before Buddha, the religious search was not concerned with the within but with the </div>
<div id="tb_35" class="t s1_35">without; it was extrovert, and when the religious search is extrovert it is not really </div>
<div id="tc_35" class="t s1_35">religious. Religion begins only with introversion, when you start diving deeply within </div>
<div id="td_35" class="t s1_35">yourself. </div>
<div id="te_35" class="t s1_35">People had looked for centuries for God: Who is the builder of the universe? Who is the </div>
<div id="tf_35" class="t s1_35">creator of the universe? And there are many who are still living in a pre-Buddha time, </div>
<div id="tg_35" class="t s1_35">who are still asking such questions: Who is the creator of the world? When did he create </div>
<div id="th_35" class="t s1_35">the world? There are some stupid people who have even determined the day, the date </div>
<div id="ti_35" class="t s1_35">and the year when God created the world. There are Christian theologians who say that </div>
<div id="tj_35" class="t s1_35">exactly four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ -- Monday, 1st January! -- God </div>
<div id="tk_35" class="t s1_35">created the world or started creating the world, and he finished the job in six days. Only </div>
<div id="tl_35" class="t s1_35">one thing is true about it: that he must have finished the job in six days, because you can </div>

<div id="to_35" class="t s1_35">....</div>
<div id="tp_35" class="t s1_35">Maybe Friedrich Nietzsche is right, that he is not resting -- he is dead! He has not shown </div>

<div id="tr_35" class="t s1_35">But Christians say, "No, he has not forgotten. Look! He sent Jesus Christ, his only </div>

<div id="tt_35" class="t s1_35">Christians say he has shown, in sending Jesus Christ... but the world is not saved. If that </div>
<div id="tu_35" class="t s1_35">was the purpose of sending Jesus Christ to the world, then Jesus has failed and through </div>

<div id="tx_35" class="t s1_35">There are many who are still living in this pre-Buddha worldview. </div>
<div id="ty_35" class="t s1_35">Buddha changed the whole religious dimension, he gave it such a beautiful turn: he </div>
<div id="tz_35" class="t s1_35">asked REAL questions. He was not a metaphysician, he never asked a metaphysical </div>
<div id="t10_35" class="t s1_35">question; to him metaphysics was all rubbish. He was the first psychologist the world </div>
<div id="t11_35" class="t s1_35">had known, because he based his religion not on philosophy but on psychology. </div>
<div id="t12_35" class="t s1_35">Psychology in its original meaning means the science of the soul, the science of the </div>
