<div id="t1_165" class="t s1_165">CHAPTER 9. ONLY IN SILENCE</div>
<div id="t2_165" class="t s2_165">A Zen story says: A man’s wife was dying. The wife had controlled the man like anything; he was</div>
<div id="t3_165" class="t s2_165">the most perfectly henpecked husband. And he was feeling a little happy that the wife was dying;</div>
<div id="t4_165" class="t s2_165">his day of freedom was not far away.</div>
<div id="t5_165" class="t s2_165">But the wife was not going to leave him so easily. While she was breathing her last she said, ”Look!</div>
<div id="t6_165" class="t s2_165">Don’t feel so happy, because I am going to become a ghost and I will haunt you and I will see that</div>
<div id="t7_165" class="t s2_165">you don’t do anything wrong. Never fool around, because I will catch you every night!”</div>
<div id="t8_165" class="t s2_165">The wife died. The husband was very much afraid, but after a few days he thought, ”Now she is</div>
<div id="t9_165" class="t s2_165">dead. Who knows whether she has become a ghost or not? Why not be really free now? I have</div>
<div id="ta_165" class="t s2_165">always wanted this woman, that woman. I have wanted to go to the pub. Now is the time! And so</div>
<div id="tb_165" class="t s2_165">many days have passed and she has not come.”</div>
<div id="tc_165" class="t s2_165">That night somebody knocked on the door. He opened the door and the wife was there! And she</div>
<div id="td_165" class="t s2_165">said, ”So, you have started dreaming, you have started thinking about and planning such things!</div>
<div id="te_165" class="t s2_165">Beware! I am not far away, I am always here! You may see me, you may not see me. Don’t think of</div>
<div id="tf_165" class="t s2_165">your freedom, etcetera, stop all that nonsense!”</div>
<div id="tg_165" class="t s2_165">And she said everything that he had thought, every single thing that he had thought – going to the</div>
<div id="th_165" class="t s2_165">pub, thinking of the neighbor’s wife – she said everything. Now it was absolutely clear that she did</div>
<div id="ti_165" class="t s2_165">know, and it was very difﬁcult. His life became that of great misery; he was free and yet not free.</div>
<div id="tj_165" class="t s2_165">And from that day the wife started coming to him almost every night and she would tell him what he</div>
<div id="tk_165" class="t s2_165">had been thinking in the ofﬁce, what he had been thinking about the typist girl – each single thought!</div>
<div id="tl_165" class="t s2_165">He was so tired, he went to a Zen master and asked him, ”Help me! She tortured me my whole life,</div>
<div id="tm_165" class="t s2_165">now she is dead and she is killing me! I have no peace of mind. I cannot even dream freely! At least</div>
<div id="tn_165" class="t s2_165">while she was alive I used to dream freely – now she even reads my dreams. In the morning she</div>
<div id="to_165" class="t s2_165">shakes me up and says, ’So you were having a sexual dream!’”</div>
<div id="tp_165" class="t s2_165">The Zen master laughed. He gave him a small bag and told him not to open it. ”It contains a few</div>
<div id="tq_165" class="t s2_165">pebbles. You take it home and when your wife comes, ask her how many pebbles are in the bag. If</div>
<div id="tr_165" class="t s2_165">she can give you the right number – count them immediately – if she can give you the right number</div>
<div id="ts_165" class="t s2_165">then come to me. If she cannot give you the right number then she is just a fantasy of your own</div>
<div id="tt_165" class="t s2_165">mind, your projection. Then too come just to tell me.”</div>
<div id="tu_165" class="t s2_165">The man went home. The wife was waiting already. When he entered the room the wife was sitting</div>
<div id="tv_165" class="t s2_165">in his chair. She said, ”So you went to that phony, that Zen master? I know him well! And he has</div>
<div id="tw_165" class="t s2_165">given you a bag – it contains pebbles – and he has told you to ask me how many pebbles it contains.”</div>
<div id="tx_165" class="t s2_165">The man became so frightened that she knew everything already! But still, the master had said she</div>
<div id="ty_165" class="t s2_165">would. So he remembered, he said, ”Okay, you know everything. Now just tell me the number of</div>
<div id="tz_165" class="t s2_165">pebbles.”</div>
<div id="t10_165" class="t s2_165">And the wife disappeared! Because he himself did not know the number, he could not project it. The</div>
<div id="t11_165" class="t s2_165">chair was empty. He looked around; the wife was not there. Since that day the wife stopped coming.</div>
<div id="t12_165" class="t s2_165">He went to the Zen master. He said, ”What trick did you do? What magic is in this bag?”</div>
<div id="t13_165" class="t s2_165">The White Lotus</div>
<div id="t14_165" class="t s2_165">165</div>
<div id="t15_165" class="t s3_165">Osho</div>
