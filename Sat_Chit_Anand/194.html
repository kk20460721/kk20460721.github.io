<div id="t1_194" class="t s1_194">CHAPTER 17. POLITICIANS ARE GREAT CRIMINALS</div>
<div id="t2_194" class="t s2_194">But something happened on the way. My own understanding is that it was a sunstroke, because he</div>
<div id="t3_194" class="t s2_194">was a very violent and angry man, too hot. And the sun was too hot and he was passing through the</div>
<div id="t4_194" class="t s2_194">desert, day and night moving towards Jerusalem. And one day, just in the middle of the day, when</div>
<div id="t5_194" class="t s2_194">the sun was hottest and he was burning with a deep desire to convert back all the Christians, he got</div>
<div id="t6_194" class="t s2_194">a double sunstroke. He fell into a coma.</div>
<div id="t7_194" class="t s2_194">And in his coma, he saw Jesus Christ. The reason is very simple: if you are so much against Jesus</div>
<div id="t8_194" class="t s2_194">Christ you will be continuously thinking only of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div id="t9_194" class="t s2_194">In that coma he saw Jesus Christ</div>
<div id="ta_194" class="t s2_194">coming in all his glory. It was just a dream, but that transformed the man. He changed his name to</div>
<div id="tb_194" class="t s2_194">make it a point that, ”I am no more the same person.” From Saul, he became Paul. And this Paul</div>
<div id="tc_194" class="t s2_194">was the founder of Christianity. He was the ﬁrst pope! A very strange pope.</div>
<div id="td_194" class="t s2_194">I think between Paul and the Polack Pope, there is not much difference – they are all living in a</div>
<div id="te_194" class="t s2_194">coma. But they have nothing to do with Jesus. I have a certain love for Jesus, although I cannot say</div>
<div id="tf_194" class="t s2_194">he was an enlightened man – but very close. He was just with the wrong kind of people. Always</div>
<div id="tg_194" class="t s2_194">choose your company very intelligently.</div>
<div id="th_194" class="t s2_194">He ﬁnally came to his senses after the cruciﬁxion. He did not die on the cross, he escaped to India.</div>
<div id="ti_194" class="t s2_194">His grave is here in Kashmir. I have been to his grave. It is strange that no Christian takes note of</div>
<div id="tj_194" class="t s2_194">that grave. If they take any interest in the grave it will show that Jesus died here, and they believe</div>
<div id="tk_194" class="t s2_194">that after resurrection he simply went to paradise. If they mean it symbolically – Kashmir is known as</div>
<div id="tl_194" class="t s2_194">the paradise of the earth – that’s perfectly true. He had come to paradise, but he did not ﬂy towards</div>
<div id="tm_194" class="t s2_194">the sky.</div>
<div id="tn_194" class="t s2_194">And he lived a long life – one hundred and twelve years.</div>
<div id="to_194" class="t s2_194">But he had learned the lesson: one</div>
<div id="tp_194" class="t s2_194">cruciﬁxion is enough. And here in this country, everybody knows so much of spirituality that you</div>
<div id="tq_194" class="t s2_194">cannot teach. At the most, you can become a disciple. There is no possibility of anybody becoming</div>
<div id="tr_194" class="t s2_194">a master or a prophet or a savior. Here everybody, even villagers, nine hundred million people are</div>
<div id="ts_194" class="t s2_194">spiritual prophets. Everybody knows the scriptures like parrots.</div>
<div id="tt_194" class="t s2_194">So coming to Kashmir with his small group of friends and fellow travelers, he simply remained silent,</div>
<div id="tu_194" class="t s2_194">just working on those few people he had brought. The village is still in existence, because he used</div>
<div id="tv_194" class="t s2_194">to call himself ‘the shepherd’. In Kashmiri the word for ‘shepherd’ is pahalgam. The village is called</div>
<div id="tw_194" class="t s2_194">Pahalgam, the village of the shepherd.</div>
<div id="tx_194" class="t s2_194">And you can see by the noses of the people you ﬁnd in</div>
<div id="ty_194" class="t s2_194">Pahalgam that once they were Jews. In fact, the whole of Kashmir was once Jewish.</div>
<div id="tz_194" class="t s2_194">It was a tribe ... Moses was taking them to Jerusalem, to Israel, not knowing himself where Israel</div>
<div id="t10_194" class="t s2_194">was. For forty years they wandered in the desert. The great prophet, Moses ... Almost seventy-ﬁve</div>
<div id="t11_194" class="t s2_194">percent of his followers died in that forty-year tedious journey in the desert, and I don’t think they</div>
<div id="t12_194" class="t s2_194">ever found Israel. What they found was a helplessness. Finally Moses was too old and not willing to</div>
<div id="t13_194" class="t s2_194">search – it is enough, he has searched enough. They settled on some land ... It was just to give a</div>
<div id="t14_194" class="t s2_194">sense to his people. And they were no more his people, they were the third generation. And there</div>
<div id="t15_194" class="t s2_194">was almost no relationship between Moses and the people he had brought.</div>
<div id="t16_194" class="t s2_194">Those who had come out of Egypt with him had died long before. And the young people were not</div>
<div id="t17_194" class="t s2_194">very interested in his leadership, in listening to him. One tribe of the Jews had got lost in the desert.</div>
<div id="t18_194" class="t s2_194">Just as an excuse, because he was feeling uneasy with his people ... They were new and young</div>
<div id="t19_194" class="t s2_194">Sat Chit Anand</div>
<div id="t1a_194" class="t s2_194">194</div>
<div id="t1b_194" class="t s3_194">Osho</div>
