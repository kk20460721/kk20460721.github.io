<div id="t1_22" class="t s1_22">Now, down the ages priests have been telling you that you are born with a soul. That </div>
<div id="t2_22" class="t s1_22">has created a very wrong state of affairs. Because everybody has been told he is born </div>
<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">with a soul, he thinks, "Then why bother? I am already a soul. I am immortal. The body </div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">will die but I am going to live." Gurdjieff said, "You are nothing but the body, and when </div>
<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">the body dies YOU will die. Only once in a while does a person survive -- one who has </div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">created soul in his life survives death -- not all. A Buddha survives, a Jesus survives, but </div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">not you! You will simply die, not even a trace will be left." </div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">What was Gurdjieff trying to do? He was shocking you to the very roots; he was trying </div>
<div id="t9_22" class="t s1_22">to take away all your consolations and foolish theories which go on helping you to </div>
<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">postpone work upon yourself. Now, to tell people, "You don't have any souls, you are </div>
<div id="tb_22" class="t s1_22">just vegetables, just a cabbage or maybe a cauliflower" -- a cauliflower is a cabbage with </div>
<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">a college education -- "but nothing more than that." He was really a master par </div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">excellence. He was taking the very earth away from underneath your feet. He was </div>
<div id="te_22" class="t s1_22">giving you such a shock that you had to think over the whole situation: are you going to </div>
<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">remain a cabbage? He was creating a situation around you in which you would have to </div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">seek and search for the soul, because who wants to die? </div>
<div id="th_22" class="t s1_22">And the idea that the soul is immortal has helped people to console themselves that </div>
<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">they are not going to die, that death is just an appearance, just a long sleep, a restful </div>
<div id="tj_22" class="t s1_22">sleep, and you will be born again. Gurdjieff says, "All nonsense. This is all nonsense! </div>
<div id="tk_22" class="t s1_22">Dead, you are dead forever -- unless you have created the soul</div>
<div id="tl_22" class="t s1_22">....</div>
<div id="tm_22" class="t s1_22">" </div>
<div id="tn_22" class="t s1_22">Now see the difference: you have been told you are already a soul, and Gurdjieff </div>
<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">changes it totally. He says, "You are not already a soul, but only an opportunity. You </div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">can use it, you can miss it." </div>
<div id="tq_22" class="t s1_22">And I would like to tell you that Gurdjieff was just using a device. It is not true. </div>
<div id="tr_22" class="t s1_22">Everybody is born with a soul. But what to do with people who have been using truths </div>
<div id="ts_22" class="t s1_22">as consolations? A great master sometimes has to lie -- and only a great master has the </div>
<div id="tt_22" class="t s1_22">right to lie -- just to pull you out of your sleep. </div>
<div id="tu_22" class="t s1_22">For example, you are fast asleep and I shake you and shake you and you don't budge. </div>
<div id="tv_22" class="t s1_22">And then I start shouting, "Fire! Fire!" and you start running out of the house. Outside </div>
<div id="tw_22" class="t s1_22">we will settle the matter. I will say that there is no fire...but this was the only way to </div>
<div id="tx_22" class="t s1_22">wake you up. </div>
<div id="ty_22" class="t s1_22">Once you have known the soul, Gurdjieff will whisper in your ear, "Now don't be </div>
<div id="tz_22" class="t s1_22">worried. Forget all about what I was telling you. But it was needed. It was a device. I </div>
<div id="t10_22" class="t s1_22">had to shout 'Fire!' otherwise you were not going to get out of your sleep." </div>
<div id="t11_22" class="t s1_22">But these people are bound to be misunderstood. To understand a man like Gurdjieff is </div>
<div id="t12_22" class="t s1_22">an almost impossible job. You can understand him only if you go with him, if you go </div>
<div id="t13_22" class="t s1_22">along with him. And the work that Gurdjieff did was a very secret work -- it can't be </div>
<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">otherwise. Real work can be done only in a mystery school. It is hidden, it is </div>
<div id="t15_22" class="t s1_22">underground. It is not public and it cannot be public. </div>
<div id="t16_22" class="t s1_22">In the Middle Ages the mystics disappeared behind the garb of alchemy; they had to </div>
<div id="t17_22" class="t s1_22">disappear because of the Christians. The Christians were destroying all kinds of sources </div>
<div id="t18_22" class="t s1_22">which were in any way in conflict with Christian ideology. They were not allowing </div>
