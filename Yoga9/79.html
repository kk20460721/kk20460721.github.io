<div id="t2_79" class="t s1_79">trust. You will receive in the same amount as you are receptive. Sannyas is simply </div>
<div id="t3_79" class="t s1_79">symbolic of your deep trust, symbolic that now you are going to be with me -- even when </div>
<div id="t4_79" class="t s1_79">all reason says don't go, even when your mind resists and says, "This is dangerous. You </div>
<div id="t5_79" class="t s1_79">are moving into a world of insecurity." When your mind tries to protect you and your </div>
<div id="t6_79" class="t s1_79">character and your structure, even then, if you are ready to go with me, you have trust. </div>
<div id="t7_79" class="t s1_79">Trust is not just an emotion; it is not sentimental. People think it is only for sentimental </div>
<div id="t8_79" class="t s1_79">people. You are wrong. In a deep sentiment you can say, "I trust," but this is not going to </div>
<div id="t9_79" class="t s1_79">be of much help because when everything will be disappearing, the first thing to </div>
<div id="ta_79" class="t s1_79">disappear will be your sentiment. It is a very weak thing, impotent. Trust has to be so </div>

<div id="tc_79" class="t s1_79">you, that whatsoever happens, at least you will not lose trust. </div>
<div id="td_79" class="t s1_79">That's why I tell you to do small things. They don't look meaningful. I insist for ochre </div>
<div id="te_79" class="t s1_79">robes. Sometimes you think, "Why? What is the point? Can't I meditate without ochre </div>
<div id="tf_79" class="t s1_79">robes?" You can meditate; that is not the point at all. I am putting a few things to you </div>
<div id="tg_79" class="t s1_79">which are not rational. There is no reason for ochre robes, there is no scientific reason for </div>
<div id="th_79" class="t s1_79">it. One can meditate and become enlightened in any color. I am giving you something </div>
<div id="ti_79" class="t s1_79">irrational just as a test whether you are ready to go with me. I put a mala around your </div>
<div id="tj_79" class="t s1_79">neck just to make a fool of you, so you go into the world like a fool. People will laugh at </div>

<div id="tm_79" class="t s1_79">you will have trust. </div>
<div id="tn_79" class="t s1_79">These are crises artificially created around you. They are tremendously significant -- with </div>
<div id="to_79" class="t s1_79">no reason. Their significance is deeper than reason. All the Masters have done that. </div>
<div id="tp_79" class="t s1_79">When Ibrahim, a Sufi Master, came to his Master to be initiated, Ibrahim was a king; and </div>
<div id="tq_79" class="t s1_79">the Master looked at him and he said, "Drop your clothes. Take my shoe, go into the </div>
<div id="tr_79" class="t s1_79">marketplace, naked, and beat your head with my shoe." People who were sitting around, </div>
<div id="ts_79" class="t s1_79">his old disciples, they said, "This is too hard. Why? You never asked this from us. You </div>
<div id="tt_79" class="t s1_79">never told us to be nude and go into the marketplace and beat your head with your shoe.' </div>
<div id="tu_79" class="t s1_79">Why are you so hard with King Ibrahim?" </div>
<div id="tv_79" class="t s1_79">The Master said, "Because his ego is bigger than yours. He is a king, and I have to drop </div>
<div id="tw_79" class="t s1_79">it; otherwise further work will not be possible." </div>
<div id="tx_79" class="t s1_79">But Ibrahim didn't ask a question; he simply dropped his clothes. It must have been very, </div>
<div id="ty_79" class="t s1_79">very difficult for him -- in the same capital where he has always been a king, almost </div>
<div id="tz_79" class="t s1_79">always been thought of as a superhuman being, moving on the street, where he has never </div>
<div id="t10_79" class="t s1_79">moved, naked, and with a shoe beating his head. But he moved, went into the town. He </div>
<div id="t11_79" class="t s1_79">was laughed at, children started throwing stones at him -- a crowd, a big crowd, laughing </div>
<div id="t12_79" class="t s1_79">and ridiculing him, that he has gone mad. But he went around the town, came back. </div>
<div id="t13_79" class="t s1_79">The Master said, "You are accepted. Now everything is possible; you are open." </div>
<div id="t14_79" class="t s1_79">Now what is the reason of it? If you understand, you will understand that this was a way </div>
<div id="t15_79" class="t s1_79">to break down his ego. When ego is gone, trust arises. </div>
<div id="t16_79" class="t s1_79">Sannyas is just a method, a means, to see whether you can Come with me. I have made it </div>
<div id="t17_79" class="t s1_79">almost difficult for you -- rumors about me all around. I go on helping them. And I will </div>
<div id="t18_79" class="t s1_79">tell you also to create as many rumors as you can. Don't be bothered about truth; create </div>
<div id="t19_79" class="t s1_79">rumors. People who will be able to make contact with me in spite of the rumors will be </div>
<div id="t1a_79" class="t s1_79">the right people, daring, courageous. Much is possible for them. </div>
