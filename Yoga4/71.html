<div id="t1_71" class="t s1_71">FLOWING THROUGH LIFE IS THE FEAR OF DEATH, THE CLINGING TO </div>
<div id="t2_71" class="t s1_71">LIFE, AND IT IS DOMINANT IN ALL, EVEN THE LEARNED. </div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s1_71">It is flowing through life. If you watch your mind, if you observe yourself, you </div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s1_71">will find that whether alert or not, a fear of death is continuously there. </div>
<div id="t5_71" class="t s1_71">Whatsoever you do, the fear of death is there. Whatsoever you enjoy, just around </div>
<div id="t6_71" class="t s1_71">the comer the shadow of death is always there, persisting. It follows you. </div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s1_71">Wherever you go, you go with it. It is something within you. You cannot leave it </div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s1_71">outside, you cannot escape from it; the fear of death is you. </div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s1_71">From where does this fear of death come? Have you known death before? If you </div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s1_71">have not known death before, why are you afraid of it, of something which you </div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s1_71">don't know? If you ask the psychologists, they will say, 'Fear is relevant if you </div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s1_71">know what death is. If you have died before, fear seems relevant.' But you don't </div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">know death. You don't know whether it is going to be painful or whether it is </div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">going to be ecstatic. Then why are you afraid? </div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s1_71">No, the fear of death is not really a fear of death, because how can you be afraid </div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s1_71">of something which is unknown, which is not known at all? How can you be </div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">afraid of something which is absolutely unknown to you? Fear of death is not </div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s1_71">really fear of death. Fear of death is really clinging to life. </div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s1_71">Life is there and you know well that you are not living it, it is bypassing you. The </div>
<div id="tk_71" class="t s1_71">river is bypassing you, you are standing on the bank, and it is going </div>
<div id="tl_71" class="t s1_71">continuously out of your hands. The fear of death, basically, is the fear that you </div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">are incapable of living and life is going. Soon, there will be no time left, and you </div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">have been waiting and you have always been preparing. You are obsessed with </div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">preparations. </div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s1_71">I have heard about a German scholar who accumulated one of the greatest </div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s1_71">libraries in the world, from all the countries, from all languages. He was never </div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">able to read a single book be cause he was always accumulating: going to China </div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">to find a very rare book written on human skin, then running to Burma, then </div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">coming to India, then to Ceylon, then to Afghanistan -- his whole life. By the time </div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s1_71">he was seventy, he had accumulated a vast collection of books, rare books. He </div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s1_71">was always postponing, and he would read them when the library was complete. </div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s1_71">And death Came. When he was dying, tears started flowing from his eyes. He </div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s1_71">asked a friend, 'What to do now? No time is left. The library is ready but my life </div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s1_71">is spent. Do something! Fetch any book from the library, read something from it </div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s1_71">so that I can understand. At least I can be satisfied a little.' The friend went to the </div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s1_71">library, fetched a book, came back -- but the scholar was dead. </div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s1_71">This happens to everybody, to almost everybody; you go on preparing for life. </div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s1_71">You think millions of preparations have to be made first and then you will enjoy, </div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s1_71">and then you will live -- but by that time, life is gone. Preparations are made but </div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s1_71">there is nobody to enjoy them. This is the fear, you know it deep down in your </div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s1_71">guts, you feel it: that life is flowing by, every moment you are dying, every </div>
<div id="t16_71" class="t s1_71">moment you are dying. </div>
