<div id="t2_149" class="t s1_149">one year later? </div>
<div id="t3_149" class="t s1_149">"Those who can't understand me are bound to MISunderstand. My words will become a </div>
<div id="t4_149" class="t s1_149">problem for them. They are already confused and I don't want to confuse them any </div>
<div id="t5_149" class="t s1_149">more. My words will create more confusion in them." </div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s1_149">The gods were at a loss what to say, how to persuade Buddha. They went away. They </div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s1_149">discussed it among themselves to find out some way, and then they came back with a </div>
<div id="t8_149" class="t s1_149">new argument. They said, "You are right, there are people, a very few people, who will </div>
<div id="t9_149" class="t s1_149">understand you immediately. And yes, we agree with you totally, they don't need it; </div>
<div id="ta_149" class="t s1_149">they will reach anyway. They are just on the borderline: one step more and they will be </div>
<div id="tb_149" class="t s1_149">buddhas. Even without you they will become buddhas, that is certain. If YOU could </div>
<div id="tc_149" class="t s1_149">become a buddha without any other buddha helping you, they can also become -- we </div>
<div id="td_149" class="t s1_149">can understand it. </div>
<div id="te_149" class="t s1_149">"And your other point is also right: there are millions of people who will not </div>
<div id="tf_149" class="t s1_149">understand you. But we don't agree with you that your words will create more </div>
<div id="tg_149" class="t s1_149">confusion. Those people are so confused, there cannot be more confusion. They have </div>
<div id="th_149" class="t s1_149">already reached to the rock bottom of confusion; you cannot confuse them any more. So </div>
<div id="ti_149" class="t s1_149">don't be worried about them. </div>
<div id="tj_149" class="t s1_149">"And we have thought about a third category also. There are a few people who are just </div>

<div id="tl_149" class="t s1_149">understand you and become enlightened and who are not so unevolved either that they </div>
<div id="tm_149" class="t s1_149">will simply become more and more confused by hearing you. They are just in the </div>

<div id="tt_149" class="t s1_149">you it makes no difference -- you have entered eternity -- but they are living in time, </div>
<div id="tu_149" class="t s1_149">and time means birth, death and the wheel of birth and death. And they will have to go </div>

<div id="tw_149" class="t s1_149">but compared to a small life -- a seventy-year life, a sixty-year life -- it is too much. You </div>
<div id="tx_149" class="t s1_149">have to think about that third category too." </div>
<div id="ty_149" class="t s1_149">Buddha listened to them and immediately agreed to speak. He followed the argument: </div>
<div id="tz_149" class="t s1_149">yes, there IS a third category. The first category is of those people who cannot </div>
