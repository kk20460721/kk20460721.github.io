<div id="t1_164" class="t s1_164">Jesus had disciples, but they all disappeared. He died alone. In fact, he lived </div>
<div id="t2_164" class="t s1_164">alone, he walked alone on this earth. The multitude that followed him, and the </div>
<div id="t3_164" class="t s1_164">disciples who were around him were just so-so. Lukewarm was their trust. There </div>
<div id="t4_164" class="t s1_164">was no intense passion in it, because when the Master was being crucified, there </div>
<div id="t5_164" class="t s1_164">was the test. They were hiding themselves. They must have been greedy people, </div>
<div id="t6_164" class="t s1_164">as all so-called religious people are. </div>
<div id="t7_164" class="t s1_164">Just before Jesus was caught and imprisoned they were discussing amongst </div>
<div id="t8_164" class="t s1_164">themselves,'In heaven, when Jesus will be sitting by the right side of God, what </div>
<div id="t9_164" class="t s1_164">will be the position of the disciples, the twelve? Who will be sitting next to </div>
<div id="ta_164" class="t s1_164">Jesus?' Of course they allowed Jesus to sit next to God; but who would be sitting </div>
<div id="tb_164" class="t s1_164">next to Jesus? There was great argument amongst them. They were greedy </div>
<div id="tc_164" class="t s1_164">people. They were just extending their ordinary minds into their so-called </div>
<div id="td_164" class="t s1_164">religious heaven. Their heaven was nothing but an extension of this earth. It was </div>
<div id="te_164" class="t s1_164">nothing new. Jesus remained alone, died alone. </div>
<div id="tf_164" class="t s1_164">Try to understand this, because just to think that you are following when there is </div>
<div id="tg_164" class="t s1_164">no danger is not enough. When death comes, when danger comes, then there will </div>
<div id="th_164" class="t s1_164">be the test. Then, not even a single disciple declared to be with him. </div>
<div id="ti_164" class="t s1_164">In fact, when Jesus was taken as a prisoner, Peter wanted to follow him. Jesus </div>
<div id="tj_164" class="t s1_164">told him,'No need to follow me, because you will deny me.' Peter said,'Never! I </div>
<div id="tk_164" class="t s1_164">will never deny you.' Jesus said,'You will deny me. Even before the cock crows </div>
<div id="tl_164" class="t s1_164">and the sun has risen, you will have denied me thrice.' And it happened. All the </div>
<div id="tm_164" class="t s1_164">disciples fled; only Peter followed. But those people who had made him prisoner </div>
<div id="tn_164" class="t s1_164">became suspicious: somebody was amongst them who looked a stranger. They </div>
<div id="to_164" class="t s1_164">asked him,'Who are you? Are you a disciple of Jesus?' He said,'No, I don't know </div>
<div id="tp_164" class="t s1_164">this man. Who is he?' And Jesus looked back and said,'The morning has not yet </div>
<div id="tq_164" class="t s1_164">come.' And it happened a second time; and it happened thrice. Jesus laughed, </div>
<div id="tr_164" class="t s1_164">and looked back at the crowd and said,'The cock has not crowed yet.' </div>
<div id="ts_164" class="t s1_164">It is so difficult to follow a Master when he is moving into death. And this the </div>
<div id="tt_164" class="t s1_164">ONLY way to follow a Master, there is no other. Because a Master has to lead </div>
<div id="tu_164" class="t s1_164">you into death; that is the only way to be reborn. There is no other. Until you die, </div>
<div id="tv_164" class="t s1_164">you will not be able to be reborn. Only through death is eternal life attained, only </div>
<div id="tw_164" class="t s1_164">through losing yourself do you gain. </div>
<div id="tx_164" class="t s1_164">Jesus died. No miracle happened. The crowd, feeling frustrated, disappeared. </div>
<div id="ty_164" class="t s1_164">AND AS THEY THUS SPAKE, JESUS HIMSELF STOOD IN THE MIDST OF </div>
<div id="tz_164" class="t s1_164">THEM, AND SAITH UNTO THEM. PEACE BE UNTO YOU. </div>
<div id="t10_164" class="t s1_164">The disciples gathered and they discussed what to do now. They were feeling </div>
<div id="t11_164" class="t s1_164">absolutely betrayed, deceived. This man simply proved not a real son of God. He </div>
<div id="t12_164" class="t s1_164">had promised again and again that he would be resurrected, that he would come </div>
<div id="t13_164" class="t s1_164">down out of death with a new, eternal body of light. And he died like an </div>
<div id="t14_164" class="t s1_164">ordinary man; and he died complaining to God,'My God, my God, why have you </div>
<div id="t15_164" class="t s1_164">forsaken me?' So.God had betrayed Jesus, Jesus had betrayed his disciples, and </div>
