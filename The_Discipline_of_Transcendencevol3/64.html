<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">methods, you will have to develop different structures, to understand them. And </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">if you don't go, they are not at a loss -- psychology suffers. </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">Psychology has remained at the level of the pathological. It is not even at the </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">level of the normal man. </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">For example, if you ask a psychoanalyst, "What do you say about Mahavir -- </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">because he threw his clothes and became naked?" certainly they will say, "He is a </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">certain type of psychotic. Many mad people suffer from that disease." Or, "He is </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">an exhibitionist; he wants to show his naked body to people -- a sexual pervert." </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">Is this right about Mahavir? And whatsoever they are saying, they are saying </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">after a long study -- but they have studied mad people. And they are true! The </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">wrong comes only because they are stretching their understanding too far away. </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">Mahavir used to pull his hair out, he wouldn't go to a barber -- because he said, </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">"Even to depend for that on a barber is a dependence." So when the hairs were </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">too long, he would simply pull them and throw them. </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">Now ask the psychoanalyst what he says. He will say, "This is a sort of madness. </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">There are mad people who pull their hair out." You may have also observed that </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">when your wife goes mad she starts pulling her hair -- becomes angry and wants </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">to pull her hair. A certain craziness -- and they are right! And yet not right. Their </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">understanding remains at the pathological level. </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">Ask them about Jesus. Many books have been written about Jesus because Jesus </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">seems to be closer to them than Mahavir. They have neglected Mahavir, and it is </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">good for Jains that they have neglected Mahavir -- otherwise they will prove </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">certainly that he is a neurotic. About Jesus they have written many books -- that </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">he is mad, that he is a megalomaniac. Why do they say this? Because there are </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">cases in madhouses -- somebody says, "I am the only prophet of God." </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">Have you heard the famous anecdote? In Baghdad it happened: </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">A man declared, in the days of Calipha Omar, "I am the real prophet. After </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">Mohammed I have been sent to the world." Of course, Mohammedans cannot </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">tolerate such a thing -- at least not Mohammedans. If he had been in India he </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">would have been tolerated, but Omar could not tolerate it. He was thrown in the </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">jail. </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">But after seven or eight days another man declared that he was God Himself. </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">Now this was going too far. That man was thrown into jail. </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">After a few days Omar went to the jail to see them because both were beaten </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">badly, punished badly. He thought, "Now they may have come to their senses." </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">He went and he asked the man who was declaring himself the new prophet -- </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">and he was laughing! His whole body was covered with wounds, blood was </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">flowing out of the wounds, but he was laughing loudly. Omar said, "Why are </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">you laughing?" </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">He said, "When God told me, 'You are going to be my last prophet, the final </div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s1_64">prophet,' He told me also that 'They will treat you badly -- they always treat </div>
