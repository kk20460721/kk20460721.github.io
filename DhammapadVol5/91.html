<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">hours." He sat outside the window, hiding behind a wall. </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">Nagarjuna threw the bowl outside the window. The thief was very much puzzled. The </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">bowl fell just near his feet. He was puzzled: "What has this man done?" He could not </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">believe his eyes, he was also shocked. He stood up -- even though he was a thief, he was </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">a master thief and he had some dignity. He thanked Nagarjuna. He said, "Sir, I have to </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">show my gratitude. But you are a rare man -- throwing out such a precious thing as if it </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">is nothing. Can I come inside and touch your feet?" </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">Nagarjuna said, "Come in! In fact I have thrown the bowl out so that you could come </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">in." </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">The thief could not understand what he was saying; he came in, he looked at Nagarjuna </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">-- his silence, his peace, his bliss -- he was overwhelmed. He said, "I feel jealous of you. I </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">have never come across a man like you. Compared to you, all others are subhuman </div>

<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">for me too one day to attain such integration, such individuality, such compassion and </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">such nonattachment to things?" </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">Nagarjuna said, "It is possible. It is everybody's potential." </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">But the thief said, "Wait! Let me tell you one thing. I have been many times to many </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">saints and they all know me and they say, 'First you stop stealing, then anything else is </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">possible. Without stopping stealing you cannot grow spiritually.' So please don't make </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">that condition because that I cannot do. It is impossible. I have tried and I have failed </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">many times. It seems that is my nature -- I have to go on stealing, so don't mention that. </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">Let me tell you first so you don't make it a condition." </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">Nagarjuna said, "That simply shows you have never seen a saint before. Those must </div>

<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">Go on stealing and do everything as skillfully as possible. It is good to be a master of </div>

<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">The thief was shocked even more: "What kind of man is this?" And he said, "Then what </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">do you suggest? What is right, what is wrong?" </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">He said, "I don't say anything is right or anything is wrong. Do one thing: if you want to </div>

<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">conscious. And report to me after seven days." </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">After seven days the thief came, bowed down, touched Nagarjuna's feet and said, "Now </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">initiate me into sannyas." </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">Nagarjuna said, "Why? What about your stealing?" </div>

<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">the whole thing seems so stupid, so meaningless. What am I doing? For what? </div>
