<div id="t1_65" class="t s1_65">One day by mistake, the cage of the parrot was left open, and he flew out of it. </div>
<div id="t2_65" class="t s1_65">Everybody had started to love the parrot, so the sage and his disciples, they all </div>
<div id="t3_65" class="t s1_65">went all over the forest to search for him. When they were reaching deeper and </div>
<div id="t4_65" class="t s1_65">deeper into the forest they heard the parrot saying, "Watch out for the trap. Don't </div>
<div id="t5_65" class="t s1_65">sit on the trap." So they were very happy that he was there. So, following the </div>
<div id="t6_65" class="t s1_65">direction of his voice, they reached there. And what did they see? They could not </div>
<div id="t7_65" class="t s1_65">believe it: he was sitting on a trap. He was trapped -- sitting on a trap he was </div>
<div id="t8_65" class="t s1_65">continuously repeating, "Watch out for the trap Don't sit on the trap." </div>
<div id="t9_65" class="t s1_65">That happens to people who live in the head. Whatsoever they say, their life is </div>
<div id="ta_65" class="t s1_65">just the contrary. They don't live it; they go on just repeating like a parrot. They </div>
<div id="tb_65" class="t s1_65">become great scholars: they know everything about God and they have not </div>
<div id="tc_65" class="t s1_65">tasted even a little bit what God means. Their life has remained untouched. Their </div>
<div id="td_65" class="t s1_65">knowledge has a separate world; it is a storage in the memory. Their heart has </div>
<div id="te_65" class="t s1_65">remained as ignorant as ever. They know much, and they know not. They seem </div>
<div id="tf_65" class="t s1_65">to know much, but their ignorance is tremendous. </div>
<div id="tg_65" class="t s1_65">I was reading the autobiography of a great mystic, a Chinese mystic, who used to </div>
<div id="th_65" class="t s1_65">be the librarian of the Chinese emperor. Once somebody asked him some </div>
<div id="ti_65" class="t s1_65">question, and of course it was expected that the librarian should know all the </div>
<div id="tj_65" class="t s1_65">answers. He was there to read and study for the king, so whenever the king </div>
<div id="tk_65" class="t s1_65">wanted to know anything he could ask the librarian. </div>
<div id="tl_65" class="t s1_65">But this librarian had a bad habit of saying to almost all questions, "I don't </div>
<div id="tm_65" class="t s1_65">know." So when some minister of the emperor asked some significant question </div>
<div id="tn_65" class="t s1_65">which needed to be answered and the librarian said, "I don't know," the minister </div>
<div id="to_65" class="t s1_65">became annoyed. He said, "The king pays you for it; you have to know it." </div>
<div id="tp_65" class="t s1_65">The librarian said, "The king pays for my knowledge. If the king is ready to pay </div>
<div id="tq_65" class="t s1_65">for my ignorance also</div>
<div id="tr_65" class="t s1_65">....</div>
<div id="ts_65" class="t s1_65">He pays me for things I know, but if he starts paying me </div>
<div id="tt_65" class="t s1_65">for things I don't know, then his treasures will not be enough. Only a few things I </div>
<div id="tu_65" class="t s1_65">know. In fact, only one thing I know," he said, "and that is myself All else I can </div>
<div id="tv_65" class="t s1_65">pretend to know. I can collect information, but that will not be knowledge." </div>
<div id="tw_65" class="t s1_65">If you go on collecting information then this will happen -- you will go on saying </div>
<div id="tx_65" class="t s1_65">yes in your head and you will go on saying no in your life. You will become a </div>
<div id="ty_65" class="t s1_65">dichotomy, a split personality. Your head will be going north; your heart will be </div>
<div id="tz_65" class="t s1_65">going south, and you will be in a constant tug of war. </div>
<div id="t10_65" class="t s1_65">That's what has happened. You know everything about love, but have you </div>
<div id="t11_65" class="t s1_65">loved? You know everything about prayer, but have you prayed? You know </div>
<div id="t12_65" class="t s1_65">everything about beauty, but have you observed beauty, have you got lost in </div>
<div id="t13_65" class="t s1_65">some beautiful phenomenon? Have you become in any moment so total that the </div>
<div id="t14_65" class="t s1_65">head and heart lose their constant tug of war? Has there ever been a moment </div>
<div id="t15_65" class="t s1_65">when you were so total that you were not? If that has not happened, then you </div>
<div id="t16_65" class="t s1_65">can go on saying yes but it will not mean much -- maybe just a polite attitude. </div>
<div id="t17_65" class="t s1_65">The so-called religious people of the world are just like the second son who said, </div>
<div id="t18_65" class="t s1_65">"I go, sir" -- and went not. Even an atheist is better because he says no. At least he </div>
<div id="t19_65" class="t s1_65">is true, at least he says whatsoever he feels. He's authentic; he says, "No, I'm not </div>
