<div id="t1_131" class="t s1_131">I have told you the story of a Sufi mystic. One night in Baghdad, the king heard </div>
<div id="t2_131" class="t s1_131">somebody walking on the roof of his palace. He shouted, "Who is there? And </div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s1_131">what are you doing there?" </div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s1_131">The man was not a thief. Without any fear he said, "Don't shout, that may disturb </div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s1_131">other people's sleep. It is none of your business. I am looking for my camel. My </div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s1_131">camel is lost and it is time for you to go to sleep." </div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s1_131">The king could not believe what kind of madman could be on the roof of a palace </div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s1_131">searching for his camel. He called the guards and they searched all over the place </div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s1_131">but could not find the man. And the next day when he was sitting in his court he </div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s1_131">heard the same voice again; he recognized it. </div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s1_131">The king immediately said, "Bring that man in," because he was arguing with the </div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s1_131">guard in front of the gate that he wanted to stay in the caravanserai. </div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s1_131">And the guard said, "You will be getting into problems unnecessarily. This is the </div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s1_131">palace of the king; this is not a caravanserai." </div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s1_131">The man said, "I know it is a caravanserai and you are just a guard. Don't bother </div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s1_131">me. Just let me go in. I want to discuss the matter with the king himself. If I can </div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s1_131">convince him that this is a caravanserai then I will stay. If he can convince me it </div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s1_131">is not a caravanserai, then of course I will leave. But I won't listen to you; you are </div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s1_131">just a guard." </div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s1_131">And just at that moment the message came from inside, "Don't stop that man. We </div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s1_131">are in search of him; bring him in." </div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s1_131">The Sufi mystic was called in and the king said, "You seem to be a very strange </div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s1_131">fellow. I recognize your voice. You were the man on the roof searching for your </div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s1_131">camel and now you are calling my place, my home, a caravanserai." </div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s1_131">The man laughed and said, "You seem to be a man of some understanding. It is </div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s1_131">possible to talk with you. Yes, it was me who was looking for the camel on the </div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s1_131">roof of the palace. Don't think that I'm insane. If you can look for blissfulness </div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s1_131">sitting on a golden throne, if you can look for God while continuously </div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s1_131">conquering and butchering and burning living human beings, what is wrong in </div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s1_131">searching for a camel on the roof of the palace? You tell me! </div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s1_131">"If I am inconsistent you are also not consistent. And what right have you got to </div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s1_131">call this place your home, because I have been here before and on the same </div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s1_131">golden throne I have seen another man sitting. He looked just like you -- a little </div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s1_131">older." </div>
<div id="tz_131" class="t s1_131">The king said, "He was my father. Now he's dead." And the mystic said, "I was </div>
<div id="t10_131" class="t s1_131">here even before that and I found another man. He also looked a little bit like you </div>
<div id="t11_131" class="t s1_131">but very old." The king said, "You are right, he was my grandfather." And the </div>
<div id="t12_131" class="t s1_131">mystic said, "What happened to him?" The king said, "He is dead." </div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s1_131">And the mystic said, "When are you going to die? They also believed that this is </div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s1_131">their home. I have argued with your grandfather. Now the poor fellow is in the </div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s1_131">grave. I have argued with your father; that poor fellow is also in the grave. Now I </div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s1_131">am arguing with you and someday I will come back again and I will be arguing </div>
<div id="t17_131" class="t s1_131">with your son and you will be in a grave. So what kind of home is this where </div>
