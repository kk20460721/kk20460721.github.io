<div id="t1_94" class="t s1_94">If you are authentic, if you are compassionate, if you are meditative, then if there is a </div>
<div id="t2_94" class="t s1_94">God he will come to you; you need not go in search for him. And if there is a paradise it </div>
<div id="t3_94" class="t s1_94">will descend in your heart. There is no need to be bothered about such abstract ideas; </div>
<div id="t4_94" class="t s1_94">they simply waste your time. And if you are not authentic, not meditative, not </div>
<div id="t5_94" class="t s1_94">compassionate, not wise enough, even if you come across God what are you going to </div>
<div id="t6_94" class="t s1_94">do? You will feel a little embarrassed and God will feel a little embarrassed facing you. </div>
<div id="t7_94" class="t s1_94">You both will be unnecessarily in a strange situation -- what to say, what to do, what </div>
<div id="t8_94" class="t s1_94">not to say, what not to do. You would like to escape and he would like to escape. </div>
<div id="t9_94" class="t s1_94">Just think: if suddenly you come across God, what will you do? You will run away from </div>
<div id="ta_94" class="t s1_94">him as fast as you can! </div>
<div id="tb_94" class="t s1_94">Rabindranath has a beautiful parable. In one of his poems he sings: I searched for God </div>
<div id="tc_94" class="t s1_94">for many lives. I saw him sometimes far away on a star, but by the time I reached there </div>
<div id="td_94" class="t s1_94">he had left the star long before; he was somewhere else. He was always somewhere else </div>
<div id="te_94" class="t s1_94">and I was chasing him. The very adventure was beautiful; I was enjoying the thrill of it. </div>
<div id="tf_94" class="t s1_94">And then one day I happened to reach his home. For a moment I was ecstatic that I had </div>
<div id="tg_94" class="t s1_94">arrived, but the next moment I became very sad. Standing at his door I was just going to </div>
<div id="th_94" class="t s1_94">ring the bell, but my hand became frozen. I thought for a while, "If I ring the bell and he </div>
<div id="ti_94" class="t s1_94">comes out, then what? Then what am I going to do? And after that whom am I going to </div>
<div id="tj_94" class="t s1_94">search? All is finished! My whole past has been nothing but a search for God; it was </div>
<div id="tk_94" class="t s1_94">meaningful because of the search. If the search disappears, all meaning will disappear." </div>
<div id="tl_94" class="t s1_94">So Rabindranath says, "I descended back from his steps. I took my shoes in my hand so </div>
<div id="tm_94" class="t s1_94">that he would not hear that somebody had come. Otherwise, who knows? He may </div>
<div id="tn_94" class="t s1_94">simply open the door and he will say, 'Come in!' And then I ran away from the place as </div>
<div id="to_94" class="t s1_94">fast as I could. </div>
<div id="tp_94" class="t s1_94">"And again I am searching for God, and now I know where he is so I avoid that space </div>
<div id="tq_94" class="t s1_94">only and I search everywhere else, knowing perfectly well that I am not going to meet </div>
<div id="tr_94" class="t s1_94">him there and my search can continue. I can go on hoping and desiring and deep down </div>
<div id="ts_94" class="t s1_94">I know the whole ridiculousness of it -- because he is just by the corner; I can reach his </div>
<div id="tt_94" class="t s1_94">home any moment." </div>
<div id="tu_94" class="t s1_94">This is a true parable about man: you also know where he is. If he is anywhere at all he </div>
<div id="tv_94" class="t s1_94">is within YOU, not even by the corner. If he is anywhere, he is in your consciousness, in </div>
<div id="tw_94" class="t s1_94">your heart of hearts. He is your life. There you don't look at all, afraid you may find </div>
<div id="tx_94" class="t s1_94">him. And you go on searching in Kaaba, in Kailash, in Kashi, and you go on and on </div>
<div id="ty_94" class="t s1_94">searching knowing perfectly well that you will not find him. And the search can </div>
<div id="tz_94" class="t s1_94">continue and the thrill can continue and you can go on hoping and desiring. </div>
<div id="t10_94" class="t s1_94">Buddha simply cuts all your hoping and desiring. He does not say there is no God, he </div>
<div id="t11_94" class="t s1_94">does not say there is. He simply says it is irrelevant. It does not matter whether he is or </div>
<div id="t12_94" class="t s1_94">he is not; it is absolutely beside the point. What matters is your inner transformation, </div>
<div id="t13_94" class="t s1_94">and the inner transformation cannot be postponed for tomorrow; it can happen right </div>
<div id="t14_94" class="t s1_94">now. </div>
