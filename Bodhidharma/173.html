<div id="t2_173" class="t s1_173">mind, then it is one thing, but if you are experiencing the process of mud </div>
<div id="t3_173" class="t s1_173">transforming into a lotus flower, you will understand Bodhidharma without any </div>
<div id="t4_173" class="t s1_173">difficulty. You will rejoice in his strange statements. </div>
<div id="t5_173" class="t s1_173">MORTALS ...again, a very strange statement: MORTALS LIBERATE BUDDHAS </div>
<div id="t6_173" class="t s1_173">AND BUDDHAS LIBERATE MORTALS. </div>
<div id="t7_173" class="t s1_173">I can understand why Buddhists have been hiding these sutras for one thousand </div>
<div id="t8_173" class="t s1_173">years, because the very idea is outrageous that MORTALS LIBERATE </div>
<div id="t9_173" class="t s1_173">BUDDHAS AND BUDDHAS LIBERATE MORTALS. But Bodhidharma is right. </div>
<div id="ta_173" class="t s1_173">Every buddha comes from the mortals and seeing the agony, the suffering, the </div>
<div id="tb_173" class="t s1_173">misery, the continuous meaninglessness of mortals is the cause of his liberation. </div>
<div id="tc_173" class="t s1_173">If there were no mortals, there would be no buddhas. </div>
<div id="td_173" class="t s1_173">When I came back from the university, naturally my parents were anxious that I </div>
<div id="te_173" class="t s1_173">should get married. They were afraid that I was not the sort and my father was </div>
<div id="tf_173" class="t s1_173">very alert that once I say no to something, then there is no way to make it yes. So </div>
<div id="tg_173" class="t s1_173">he asked his friends, "Just find out what's on his mind, if it is possible that he </div>
<div id="th_173" class="t s1_173">would say yes. Only then, I will ask him. Once he has said no to me, it is </div>
<div id="ti_173" class="t s1_173">finished." </div>
<div id="tj_173" class="t s1_173">So his friends started asking me. One of his friends was the best physician of that </div>
<div id="tk_173" class="t s1_173">area. He called me to have a dinner with him and along the way he mentioned, </div>
<div id="tl_173" class="t s1_173">"What do you think about marriage?" </div>
<div id="tm_173" class="t s1_173">I said, "Uncle, I am unmarried; I don't have any experience. You have been </div>

<div id="to_173" class="t s1_173">me, what do you think?" </div>
<div id="tp_173" class="t s1_173">He looked very miserable and he said, "My experience -- I am a fool! I should </div>
<div id="tq_173" class="t s1_173">have stopped when my first wife died. But fools are fools. I married again </div>
<div id="tr_173" class="t s1_173">thinking that not every woman is going to be the same. But within a few days </div>
<div id="ts_173" class="t s1_173">...the woman was different but the problems were the same. And God has been </div>
<div id="tt_173" class="t s1_173">so kind to me, even the second wife died. But my stupidity is such, I married </div>
<div id="tu_173" class="t s1_173">again and now I am suffering. And you are asking me, `What do you think about </div>
<div id="tv_173" class="t s1_173">marriage'!" </div>
<div id="tw_173" class="t s1_173">I said, "That's enough. Just tell my father your experience. You have liberated me </div>
<div id="tx_173" class="t s1_173">from marriage." </div>
<div id="ty_173" class="t s1_173">He said, "What do you mean by that? I have done just the opposite of what your </div>
<div id="tz_173" class="t s1_173">father asked me. I was going to convince you." </div>
<div id="t10_173" class="t s1_173">I said, "You have convinced me! Just tell my father the whole thing that </div>
<div id="t11_173" class="t s1_173">happened ...I will get married only if you say yes." </div>
<div id="t12_173" class="t s1_173">He said, "I cannot. No, I will not drag you into the same hell in which I have </div>
<div id="t13_173" class="t s1_173">lived. I cannot say yes." </div>
<div id="t14_173" class="t s1_173">"Then," I said, "tell my father that you have convinced me that I should not get </div>
<div id="t15_173" class="t s1_173">married." </div>
<div id="t16_173" class="t s1_173">He said, "You have put me in such trouble. Your father is depending on me." </div>
