<div id="t4_55" class="t s1_55">But Ta Hui has not understood, although he has been from one master to another -- to</div>
<div id="t5_55" class="t s1_55">many masters. Perhaps that has created the whole confusion in him. In those many masters, a</div>
<div id="t6_55" class="t s1_55">few may have been just teachers, a few may not have even been teachers, but people who love</div>
<div id="t7_55" class="t s1_55">to advise -- whether they know anything or not. They enjoy advising, because in advising they</div>
<div id="t8_55" class="t s1_55">become higher than you; you are ignorant, and they are knowledgeable.</div>
<div id="t9_55" class="t s1_55">I have been part of a psychology department in a university. There were four other</div>
<div id="ta_55" class="t s1_55">psychologists in the department, and they were all practicing psychoanalysis, except me. I</div>
<div id="tb_55" class="t s1_55">never believed in any kind of analysis, any kind of psychology, because I don't want to do</div>
<div id="tc_55" class="t s1_55">anything with the mind at all. But you will be surprised, they were giving counseling to sick</div>
<div id="td_55" class="t s1_55">people -- mentally sick, psychologically sick. They were analyzing, and they were earning</div>
<div id="te_55" class="t s1_55">much money, but they were suffering from the same problems.</div>
<div id="tf_55" class="t s1_55">I was the only one available, so they were all asking me, "What to do with this problem</div>
<div id="tg_55" class="t s1_55">that never leaves us?"</div>
<div id="th_55" class="t s1_55">I said, "You are great psychoanalysts; you counsel people, you help people."</div>
<div id="ti_55" class="t s1_55">They said, "Don't make a laughingstock of us! We know the technique, we have learned</div>
<div id="tj_55" class="t s1_55">psychoanalysis, and we advise."</div>
<div id="tk_55" class="t s1_55">But I said, "If you cannot follow your own advice, what right have you got to give it to</div>
<div id="tl_55" class="t s1_55">somebody else?"</div>
<div id="tm_55" class="t s1_55">I used to tell them an ancient Sufi story. A woman was very much disturbed by her young</div>
<div id="tn_55" class="t s1_55">child -- she had only one child, and her husband had died. She was rich, but she had lost all</div>
<div id="to_55" class="t s1_55">interest in life. She was living simply because of this small child, and certainly in such</div>
<div id="tp_55" class="t s1_55">circumstances, children are spoiled; the child would not eat anything except sweets. The</div>
<div id="tq_55" class="t s1_55">doctors were saying, "This is bad, his whole health will be spoiled." But the child was not</div>
<div id="tr_55" class="t s1_55">listening.</div>
<div id="ts_55" class="t s1_55">The woman used to go to the Sufi mystic, so one day she thought, "He does not listen to</div>
<div id="tt_55" class="t s1_55">me, but perhaps he may listen to the mystic, because the man is so radiant that anybody who</div>
<div id="tu_55" class="t s1_55">goes close to him feels impressed."</div>
<div id="tv_55" class="t s1_55">She took the child and she told the mystic, "He does not listen to anybody. Doctors tell</div>
<div id="tw_55" class="t s1_55">him that his health will be spoiled, and I am telling him every day. His whole food consists</div>
<div id="tx_55" class="t s1_55">only of sweets; otherwise he prefers to remain hungry. He is my only child, my husband is</div>
<div id="ty_55" class="t s1_55">dead, and I am only living for him. I cannot see him hungry, so I have to give him sweets,</div>
<div id="tz_55" class="t s1_55">knowing well that I am giving poison to him -- white sugar is white poison. So I have brought</div>
<div id="t10_55" class="t s1_55">him. You tell him something! You are a man of God, perhaps your words may have a different</div>
<div id="t11_55" class="t s1_55">impact."</div>
<div id="t12_55" class="t s1_55">The mystic looked at the child. He said, "My son, I am not in a position to answer you</div>
<div id="t13_55" class="t s1_55">right now because I myself love to eat sweets. You come back after two weeks. For two weeks</div>
<div id="t14_55" class="t s1_55">I will not eat sweets, if I can manage it. Only then can I advise; otherwise, I am not the right</div>
<div id="t15_55" class="t s1_55">person to advise."</div>
<div id="t16_55" class="t s1_55">The woman could not believe it. This could even be dangerous ... but the child was</div>
<div id="t17_55" class="t s1_55">immensely impressed. He touched the feet of the mystic. He said, "I have been taken to many</div>
