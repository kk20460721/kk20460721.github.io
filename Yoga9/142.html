<div id="t4_142" class="t s1_142">I have heard: </div>
<div id="t5_142" class="t s1_142">Comrade Cohen was a member of a Russian trade mission to an English industrial town. </div>
<div id="t6_142" class="t s1_142">One evening the Russians were guests at the local workingmen's club. One of the club </div>
<div id="t7_142" class="t s1_142">members was Joe Chubb, an earnest young socialist, who eventually maneuvered </div>

<div id="td_142" class="t s1_142">the Egyptian fascists against the democratic Israelis." </div>
<div id="te_142" class="t s1_142">From Comrade Cohen, silence. Just a slight shrug. </div>
<div id="tf_142" class="t s1_142">"But, come, Comrad Cohen," the young man persisted, "after all, you are a Jew. Despite </div>
<div id="tg_142" class="t s1_142">the official attitude of your country, of your party, you must have your own view as to </div>
<div id="th_142" class="t s1_142">where justice lies -- of whose cause is the right one." </div>
<div id="ti_142" class="t s1_142">But Comrade Cohen would say nothing, not a word. </div>
<div id="tj_142" class="t s1_142">Joe Chubb leant nearer. In a tone almost of pleading he urged, "But surely, Comrade </div>
<div id="tk_142" class="t s1_142">Cohen, you must have an opinion." </div>
<div id="tl_142" class="t s1_142">Comrade Cohen stirred in his chair and regarded the young man with a steady gaze, and </div>
<div id="tm_142" class="t s1_142">he broke his silence. "Comrade Chubb," he said, "I have an opinion." He paused, "But I </div>

<div id="tq_142" class="t s1_142">but you have been conditioned to have a prejudice about it. </div>
<div id="tr_142" class="t s1_142">Just put aside all prejudices. Simply watch life. Let life reveal itself to you as if you have </div>

<div id="tt_142" class="t s1_142">you simply watch, with no ideology behind it -- Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan. With </div>

<div id="t14_142" class="t s1_142">but it is nothing but a magical trick to seduce the other sex. If you look around, you will </div>
<div id="t15_142" class="t s1_142">be surprised. All that is beautiful is sexual. </div>
<div id="t16_142" class="t s1_142">And your saints go on praising the flowers. They are just against the flowering of human </div>
