<div id="t2_105" class="t s1_105">into the divine. Death is the door to the divine. Death is the name of the door of God's </div>
<div id="t3_105" class="t s1_105">temple. The meditator dies voluntarily. </div>
<div id="t4_105" class="t s1_105">There are two kinds of death. One is the ordinary death; everybody dies it. That is not </div>
<div id="t5_105" class="t s1_105">the mystic's death. The ordinary death happens against you; you go into it very </div>
<div id="t6_105" class="t s1_105">reluctantly. You don't want to go into it, you cling to life. You don't become available to </div>
<div id="t7_105" class="t s1_105">it, you don't become open to it. Hence you go on missing the point. </div>
<div id="t8_105" class="t s1_105">Many times you have died, but each time you died so much obsessed with life that you </div>
<div id="t9_105" class="t s1_105">could not see what death is. Your eyes were focused on life, you were clinging to life. </div>
<div id="ta_105" class="t s1_105">You were snatched away, and the only way to snatch you away is to make you </div>
<div id="tb_105" class="t s1_105">unconscious. </div>
<div id="tc_105" class="t s1_105">When the surgeon is going to operate on you he makes you unconscious, he gives you </div>
<div id="td_105" class="t s1_105">anesthesia. That's what death has been doing for centuries, from eternity. If you can't go </div>
<div id="te_105" class="t s1_105">joyously, dancingly into it, there is a built-in anesthesia: people become unconscious </div>
<div id="tf_105" class="t s1_105">before they die. That's why you don't remember your past lives, because you became so </div>
<div id="tg_105" class="t s1_105">deeply unconscious before you died that the chapter became closed. </div>
<div id="th_105" class="t s1_105">If a person can die conscious, alert, he will remember his past life. That's how India </div>
<div id="ti_105" class="t s1_105">discovered that there is not only one life; millions of times you have lived. You are not </div>
<div id="tj_105" class="t s1_105">new, you are very ancient pilgrims. But each time you died reluctantly, unconsciously; </div>
<div id="tk_105" class="t s1_105">hence you forgot everything. </div>
<div id="tl_105" class="t s1_105">The mystic dies voluntarily. The mystic dies before the actual death; he dies in </div>
<div id="tm_105" class="t s1_105">meditation. Lovers know a little bit of it because fifty percent of love is death. That's </div>
<div id="tn_105" class="t s1_105">why love is very close to meditation. Lovers know something of meditativeness; </div>
<div id="to_105" class="t s1_105">unawares they have stumbled upon it. Lovers know silence, stillness. Lovers know </div>
<div id="tp_105" class="t s1_105">timelessness, but they have stumbled upon it -- it has not been their basic search. </div>
<div id="tq_105" class="t s1_105">The mystic goes into it very consciously, deliberately. Meditation is total death, </div>
<div id="tr_105" class="t s1_105">voluntary death. One dies into oneself. Before death ever comes the mystic dies. He dies </div>
<div id="ts_105" class="t s1_105">every day. Whenever he meditates he goes into death. He reaches to those heights, </div>
<div id="tt_105" class="t s1_105">those depths, and, slowly slowly, as meditation becomes natural, he starts living death. </div>
<div id="tu_105" class="t s1_105">Then each moment of his life is also a moment of death. Each moment he dies to the </div>
<div id="tv_105" class="t s1_105">past and remains fresh, because the moment you die to the past you become alive to the </div>
<div id="tw_105" class="t s1_105">present. </div>
<div id="tx_105" class="t s1_105">He dies continuously and remains as fresh as dewdrops or lotus leaves in the early </div>
<div id="ty_105" class="t s1_105">morning sun. His freshness, his youth, his timelessness, depend on the art of dying. </div>
<div id="tz_105" class="t s1_105">And then when actual death comes he has nothing to fear, because he has known this </div>
<div id="t10_105" class="t s1_105">death thousands of times. He is thrilled, enchanted; he dances! Joyously he wants to die. </div>
<div id="t11_105" class="t s1_105">Death does not create fear in him; on the contrary, a tremendous attraction, a great pull. </div>
<div id="t12_105" class="t s1_105">And because he dies joyously he dies without becoming unconscious, and he knows the </div>
<div id="t13_105" class="t s1_105">total secret of death. Knowing it, he has the master key that can unlock all the doors. He </div>
<div id="t14_105" class="t s1_105">has the key that can open the door of God. </div>
<div id="t15_105" class="t s1_105">And now he knows that he is not a separate individual. The very idea of separation was </div>
<div id="t16_105" class="t s1_105">stupid. The very idea of separation was there because he was not aware of death. You </div>
<div id="t17_105" class="t s1_105">think yourself separate as an ego because you don't know what death is. If you know </div>
