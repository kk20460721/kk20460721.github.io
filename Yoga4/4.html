<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">I feel deep affinity with a man who was born two thousand years ago in Greece. </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">His name was Epicurus. Nobody thinks of him as religious. People think that he </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">was the most atheistic man ever born, the most materialistic ever born; he was </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">just the opposite of the religious man. But that is not my understanding. </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">Epicurus was a naturally religious man. Remember the words 'naturally </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">religious'; religion happens to him. That's why people overlooked him, because </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">he never sought. The proverb: Eat, drink and be merry, comes from Epicurus. </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">And this has become the attitude of the materialist. </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">Epicurus in fact lived one of the most austere of lives. He lived as simply as </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">anybody has ever lived. Even a Mahavir or a Buddha were not so simple and </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">austere as Epicurus, because their simplicity was cultivated; they had worked for </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">it, it had been a practice. They had thought about it and they had dropped all </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">that w as unnecessary. They had been disciplining themselves to be simple, and </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">whenever there is discipline, there is complexity. There is a fight in the </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">background, and the fight will always be there, in the background. Mahavir was </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">naked, nude; he had renounced all, but he had renounced. It was not natural. </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">Epicurus lived in a small garden. The garden was known as Epicurus' garden. </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">He had no academy like Aristotle, or a school like Plato; he had a garden. It </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">seems simple and beautiful. A garden seems more natural than an academy. He </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">lived in the garden with a few friends. That was probably the first commune. </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">They were just living there, not doing anything in particular, working in the </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">garden, having just enough to live. </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">It is said that the King once came to visit and he had been thinking that this man </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">must be living in luxury because his motto was: Eat, drink and be merry. 'lf this </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">is the message,' the King thought, 'I will see people living in luxury, in </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">indulgence.' But when he arrived he saw very simple people working in the </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">garden, watering trees. The whole day they had been working. They had very </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">few belongings, only enough to live. In the evening, when they were having </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">dinner, there was not even any butter; just dry bread and a little milk. But they </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">enjoyed it as if it were a feast. After the dinner, they danced. The day was over </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">and they offered a thanksgiving to the existence. And the King wept, because he </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">had always thought to condemn Epicurus in his mind. He asked, 'What do you </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">mean by saying, "Eat, drink and be merry?"' Epicurus said, 'You have seen. For </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">twenty four hours we are happy here. If you want to be happy you have to be </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">simple, because the more complex you are, the more unhappy you become. The </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">more complex your life, the more misery it creates. We are simple not because </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">we are seeking God, we are simple because to be simple is to be happy.' And the </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">King said, 'I would like to send some presents for you. What would you like for </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">the garden and your community?' Epicurus was at a loss. He thought and </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">thought and he said, 'We don't think that anything else is needed. Don't be </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">offended; you are a great King, you can give everything -- but we don't need. If </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">you insist, you can send a little salt and butter.' He was an austere man. </div>
