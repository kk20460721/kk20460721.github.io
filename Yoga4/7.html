<div id="t1_7" class="t s1_7">contact with reality; burdened you cannot come. A rich man always has his bank </div>
<div id="t2_7" class="t s1_7">balance in the way. </div>
<div id="t3_7" class="t s1_7">You see the Queen of England, Elizabeth? She cannot even shake hands without </div>
<div id="t4_7" class="t s1_7">gloves on. She cannot even touch humanity without gloves on. Even the human </div>
<div id="t5_7" class="t s1_7">touch seems to be something impure, something ugly. A queen, a king, live </div>
<div id="t6_7" class="t s1_7">encapsulated; it is not only a question of the hand. That is just a symbol to say </div>
<div id="t7_7" class="t s1_7">that the Queen is entombed; she is no longer alive. </div>
<div id="t8_7" class="t s1_7">In the Middle Ages in Europe it was thought that kings and queens didn't have </div>
<div id="t9_7" class="t s1_7">two legs, because nobody had ever seen them naked. It was thought that they </div>
<div id="ta_7" class="t s1_7">had only one leg. They were not human; they were living at a distance. Ego </div>
<div id="tb_7" class="t s1_7">always tries to live at a distance, and the distance makes you insensitive. You </div>
<div id="tc_7" class="t s1_7">cannot come and touch a child playing on the road. You cannot come near a tree </div>
<div id="td_7" class="t s1_7">and embrace the tree. You cannot come nearer to life; you are pretending that </div>
<div id="te_7" class="t s1_7">you are higher than life, greater than life, bigger than life. The distance has to be </div>
<div id="tf_7" class="t s1_7">created and only then can you pose as being bigger than life. But life is not losing </div>
<div id="tg_7" class="t s1_7">anything by your foolishness; you are only becoming more and more insensitive. </div>
<div id="th_7" class="t s1_7">You are already dead. Life needs you to be more alive. </div>
<div id="ti_7" class="t s1_7">When Patanjali says 'austerity', he means, 'Be simple, don't cultivate it.' Because </div>
<div id="tj_7" class="t s1_7">cultivated simplicity is not simplicity. How can a cultivated simplicity be simple? </div>
<div id="tk_7" class="t s1_7">It is very complex; you have been trying, calculating, cultivating. </div>
<div id="tl_7" class="t s1_7">I know a man; I happened to pass by the village where he was living. My driver </div>
<div id="tm_7" class="t s1_7">said, 'Your friend lives here, just outside the village.' So I said, 'It is good. Just for </div>
<div id="tn_7" class="t s1_7">a few minutes I will go see him, and see what he is doing now.' He was a Jain </div>
<div id="to_7" class="t s1_7">monk. When I reached near his house, through the window I could see him </div>
<div id="tp_7" class="t s1_7">walking naked inside. Jain monks have five stages; by and by, they cultivate </div>
<div id="tq_7" class="t s1_7">simplicity. At the fifth stage, the last, they become naked. First they will wear </div>
<div id="tr_7" class="t s1_7">three articles of clothing, then two, then one, and then that too is to be dropped. </div>
<div id="ts_7" class="t s1_7">That is the highest ideal of simplicity, when one becomes absolutely nude; </div>
<div id="tt_7" class="t s1_7">nothing to carry -- no burden, no clothes, no things. But I knew that this man was </div>
<div id="tu_7" class="t s1_7">only in the second stage, so why was he nude? </div>
<div id="tv_7" class="t s1_7">I knocked on the door. He opened the door, but now he was wrapped in a </div>
<div id="tw_7" class="t s1_7">lunghi. So I asked, 'What is the matter.? Just now I saw you through the window </div>
<div id="tx_7" class="t s1_7">and you were nude.' He said, 'Yes, I am practicing. I am practicing for the fifth, </div>
<div id="ty_7" class="t s1_7">the last stage. First, I will practice inside the house, then with friends; then, by </div>
<div id="tz_7" class="t s1_7">and by, I will move to the village, and then to the larger world. I have to practice. </div>
<div id="t10_7" class="t s1_7">It will take at least a few years for me to drop the shyness, to be courageous </div>
<div id="t11_7" class="t s1_7">enough to move naked in the world.' I told him, 'You had better join a circus. </div>
<div id="t12_7" class="t s1_7">You will be nude, but a practiced nudity is not simple; it is very calculated. You </div>
<div id="t13_7" class="t s1_7">are very cunning, and you are moving step by step with cleverness. In fact, you </div>
<div id="t14_7" class="t s1_7">will never become nude. A practiced nudity will be like clothes again, very </div>
<div id="t15_7" class="t s1_7">subtle clothing. You are creating them by practice. </div>
<div id="t16_7" class="t s1_7">'If you feel like an innocent child, you will simply drop the clothes and move in </div>
<div id="t17_7" class="t s1_7">the world. What is the fear -- that people will laugh? What is wrong in their </div>
