<div id="t1_8" class="t s1_8">The missionary gave a few examples. He said, "For example, some old woman wants to </div>
<div id="t2_8" class="t s1_8">cross the street and the traffic is too much -- hold her hand, help her to cross the street." </div>
<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">And so on, so forth. </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">Next Sunday he inquired, "How many of you did some act of public service?" </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">Three boys -- the strongest and the biggest in the class -- stood up. They said, "We did </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">one act of public service." </div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s1_8">The missionary was very happy. "So you say</div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">....</div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">" He asked the first boy, "What did you </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">do?" </div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s1_8">He said, "I helped an old woman, a very old woman, to cross the street." </div>
<div id="tc_8" class="t s1_8">He patted the boy and he said, "You are a good boy. Go on doing such good acts." He </div>
<div id="td_8" class="t s1_8">asked the next boy, "What did you do?" </div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s1_8">He said, "I also helped a very old woman to cross the street." </div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s1_8">The missionary was a little puzzled that both could find two very old women, but there </div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s1_8">are many old women -- it is possible. He patted the second boy also, but not so heartily. </div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s1_8">With a little suspicion he said, "Good. Go on doing." </div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">Then he asked the third. </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">The third said, "I also helped a very very old woman to cross the street." </div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">Now it was too much! Such a coincidence can't be, that three very very old women </div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">wanted to cross the street. And he asked, "What day, what time?" It was the same day </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">and the same time and the same street! So he said, "You please explain -- how could you </div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s1_8">find three such very very old women?" </div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s1_8">They said, "They were not three -- it was only one woman, very very old. We all three </div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s1_8">helped her." </div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s1_8">He said, "That too is good, but were three persons needed?" </div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s1_8">They said, "Three? Although she was old, she made so much fuss because she never </div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s1_8">wanted to go to the other side! But we DID manage. When one has to do some public </div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s1_8">act, some public service, one has to do it. She was shouting and cursing and calling the </div>
<div id="tu_8" class="t s1_8">policeman, but we were determined to do it and we did it!" </div>
<div id="tv_8" class="t s1_8">As far as Buddha is concerned, whatsoever you are doing is mischief because </div>
<div id="tw_8" class="t s1_8">whatsoever you are doing is done out of unconsciousness. His definition of mischief is: </div>
<div id="tx_8" class="t s1_8">any act done unconsciously. And any act done consciously is virtue. </div>
<div id="ty_8" class="t s1_8">Your life is almost a vicious circle: one mischief leads to another and that one leads to </div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s1_8">still another. Mischiefs grow out of mischiefs -- only mischiefs can grow out of </div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">mischiefs. And you go on living and moving in circles and you don't know what else to </div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s1_8">do. You do good -- at least you think you are doing good -- but the good never happens; </div>
<div id="t12_8" class="t s1_8">otherwise the world would have been overflowing with good. </div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s1_8">So many people are doing good -- parents doing good to children, and where are the </div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s1_8">good children? Husbands are doing good to wives -- and wives are really after </div>
<div id="t15_8" class="t s1_8">husbands to transform them, to change them, to make them saints. But where are those </div>
<div id="t16_8" class="t s1_8">husbands and where are those wives and where are those children? Everybody is trying </div>
<div id="t17_8" class="t s1_8">to do good according to his own idea -- and he himself is living in deep darkness. </div>
