<div id="t1_76" class="t s1_76">Jesus even kissed Judas and washed his feet, and he knew the man had betrayed him. </div>
<div id="t2_76" class="t s1_76">He knew perfectly well, because before he washed the feet of Judas he told his disciples, </div>
<div id="t3_76" class="t s1_76">"Tonight I am going to be betrayed by one of you." But he cannot do otherwise: he can </div>
<div id="t4_76" class="t s1_76">only kiss, he can only wash the feet. He has no ego, he is utterly humble. In fact, he has </div>
<div id="t5_76" class="t s1_76">no self; he is a nonself. Buddha's word for it is ANATTA -- no-self. And he is constantly </div>
<div id="t6_76" class="t s1_76">radiating the cool energy of the moon. </div>
<div id="t7_76" class="t s1_76">HE IS THE MOON. HE IS SERENE. HE SHINES -- he is as serene as the moon and he </div>
<div id="t8_76" class="t s1_76">shines as beautifully as the moon. </div>
<div id="t9_76" class="t s1_76">FOR HE HAS TRAVELED </div>
<div id="ta_76" class="t s1_76">LIFE AFTER LIFE </div>
<div id="tb_76" class="t s1_76">THE MUDDY AND TREACHEROUS ROAD OF ILLUSION. </div>
<div id="tc_76" class="t s1_76">He knows from bitter experience. He has every compassion for you. If you are deep in </div>
<div id="td_76" class="t s1_76">your mud he only has compassion for you. He makes every effort to pull you out of the </div>
<div id="te_76" class="t s1_76">mud because he has been in the same mud for lives. He has traveled the same path, he </div>
<div id="tf_76" class="t s1_76">has gone astray thousands of times, he has suffered in the same way. </div>
<div id="tg_76" class="t s1_76">That is one of the most beautiful things Buddha taught, because all other religions were </div>
<div id="th_76" class="t s1_76">trying to prove something else. Hindus were saying in India that Krishna, Rama and all </div>
<div id="ti_76" class="t s1_76">their AVATARAS, they descend from heaven, they are parts of God, they are </div>
<div id="tj_76" class="t s1_76">incarnations of God. That is the meaning of 'avatara'; avatara means "descending from </div>
<div id="tk_76" class="t s1_76">above." They are not part of us, they came as messengers of God. They have not </div>
<div id="tl_76" class="t s1_76">traveled on the same muddy path. How can they understand our misery? How can they </div>
<div id="tm_76" class="t s1_76">understand our problems? They have never suffered the same problems. </div>
<div id="tn_76" class="t s1_76">And the same was the case with Judaism. And remember, these are the only two </div>
<div id="to_76" class="t s1_76">religions; all other religions are born out of these two. Judaism was also preaching the </div>
<div id="tp_76" class="t s1_76">same idea: that God sends his messengers, messiahs, prophets. Those are special </div>
<div id="tq_76" class="t s1_76">people, they are not ordinary like you. </div>
<div id="tr_76" class="t s1_76">Buddha's approach is tremendously human; he is the first humanitarian mystic. He </div>
<div id="ts_76" class="t s1_76">says, "I have traveled on the same muddy path, I have suffered in the same way you are </div>
<div id="tt_76" class="t s1_76">suffering, I have committed the same mistakes. Hence I can understand you, and I can </div>
<div id="tu_76" class="t s1_76">understand why you are unable to understand me, because I have come across many </div>
<div id="tv_76" class="t s1_76">buddhas in my other lives, many buddhas; I never understood them, I always </div>
<div id="tw_76" class="t s1_76">misunderstood them. So if you are misunderstanding me there is nothing to make a </div>
<div id="tx_76" class="t s1_76">fuss about. It is simple, it is natural, it is inevitable. So whatsoever you do to me," </div>
<div id="ty_76" class="t s1_76">Buddha says, "it is okay. Still I will go on showering my flowers on you because I have </div>
<div id="tz_76" class="t s1_76">nothing else to shower." </div>
<div id="t10_76" class="t s1_76">Buddha is not an avatara. He has not come from the above, he has risen from the below. </div>

<div id="t12_76" class="t s1_76">completely agree with him. The Hindu and the Jewish concept is utterly inhuman; that </div>
<div id="t13_76" class="t s1_76">concept is not right. That cannot help humanity to be transformed. </div>
<div id="t14_76" class="t s1_76">Buddha brings a totally new insight. His approach is not mythological, his approach is </div>
<div id="t15_76" class="t s1_76">scientific. FOR HE HAS TRAVELED LIFE AFTER LIFE THE MUDDY AND </div>
