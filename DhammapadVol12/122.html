<div id="t2_122" class="t s1_122">became their country, money became their religion, money became their home, money </div>
<div id="t3_122" class="t s1_122">became their security. That was bound to happen. </div>
<div id="t4_122" class="t s1_122">In a country like India where for thousands of years everybody has been told to seek </div>
<div id="t5_122" class="t s1_122">and search for his salvation</div>
<div id="t6_122" class="t s1_122">....</div>
<div id="t7_122" class="t s1_122">And, of course, you can seek and search only for YOUR </div>
<div id="t8_122" class="t s1_122">salvation; you cannot seek and search for somebody else's salvation, that is not possible. </div>
<div id="t9_122" class="t s1_122">The inward journey has to be done in absolute aloneness. But the by-product of it has </div>
<div id="ta_122" class="t s1_122">been that Indians have become very selfish. It was bound to happen. It is an ugly </div>
<div id="tb_122" class="t s1_122">phenomenon, but too much insistence on going inwards, extreme insistence on going </div>
<div id="tc_122" class="t s1_122">inwards, has made people very selfish, because there is nobody who is yours. That has </div>
<div id="td_122" class="t s1_122">been the teaching of all the mahatmas: "You are alone. You are born alone, you have to </div>
<div id="te_122" class="t s1_122">live alone, you have to die alone. Nobody is going with you. All relationships are just </div>
<div id="tf_122" class="t s1_122">superficial, so don't be bothered much by them and don't invest much in them." That </div>
<div id="tg_122" class="t s1_122">has made India more selfish than any other country. </div>
<div id="th_122" class="t s1_122">This is one of the most selfish countries in the world. It is because of this selfishness that </div>
<div id="ti_122" class="t s1_122">India has remained in bondage for thousands of years -- because everybody thinks only </div>
<div id="tj_122" class="t s1_122">of himself. So if an enemy comes and conquers the country, who bothers about the </div>
<div id="tk_122" class="t s1_122">country? The country does not really exist; there is no idea of nation in India. </div>
<div id="tl_122" class="t s1_122">Individuals are there, but there is no nation. Hence all kinds of quarrels and small </div>
<div id="tm_122" class="t s1_122">divisions and subdivisions... you will not find the same thing happening anywhere else </div>
<div id="tn_122" class="t s1_122">in the world. Every political party goes on splitting into many many small fragments. </div>
<div id="to_122" class="t s1_122">Then those small fragments start splitting into smaller ones, and the process seems to be </div>
<div id="tp_122" class="t s1_122">unending -- unless you are your own party! You are the member and you are the </div>
<div id="tq_122" class="t s1_122">president and you are the secretary. When only you are left alone, only then will the </div>
<div id="tr_122" class="t s1_122">process stop. And who knows whether there too the process will stop or not? -- because </div>
<div id="ts_122" class="t s1_122">the habit of splitting everything has gone so deep that you may start saying, "Legs are </div>

<div id="tu_122" class="t s1_122">higher part is superior and the lower is inferior. The higher part means the brahmins, </div>

<div id="tw_122" class="t s1_122">Every race has passed through different phases, different climates. This is a hot country. </div>
<div id="tx_122" class="t s1_122">A hot country makes people lazy, so you cannot compete with Indians as far as laziness </div>
<div id="ty_122" class="t s1_122">is concerned. They are utterly lazy and lousy! You cannot compete with them, it is </div>
<div id="tz_122" class="t s1_122">impossible; they will surpass everyone in that. No country can have any superiority as </div>
<div id="t10_122" class="t s1_122">far as laziness and lousiness is concerned. Indians are the tops! </div>
<div id="t11_122" class="t s1_122">Because it is a hot country and the climate is not provoking people to work more, </div>
<div id="t12_122" class="t s1_122">people have remained poor. If one person in the whole family earns then it is enough. If </div>
<div id="t13_122" class="t s1_122">just enough is available to survive, Indians are satisfied, more than satisfied. Of course, </div>
<div id="t14_122" class="t s1_122">they find rationalizations for it, they find great spiritual rationalizations for it -- "We are </div>

<div id="t16_122" class="t s1_122">the climate is hot and they don't want to work -- so they have to create a philosophy to </div>
<div id="t17_122" class="t s1_122">support themselves: "We are not much concerned about mundane things, we only think </div>
<div id="t18_122" class="t s1_122">of spiritual things." </div>
