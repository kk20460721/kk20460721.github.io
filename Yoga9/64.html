<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">economically, socially, death is going to take them all away from you -- and not much </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">intelligence is needed to understand this -- but the inner powers, death cannot take them </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">away. They are beyond death. And they never frustrate you. They are your powers, your </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">potentialities come to flower. There seems to be no need to sacrifice them, no need to </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">renounce them, but Patanjali is saying that they have also to be renounced. Otherwise you </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">will start living in a world of visions -- again the power trip. And religion is not a power </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">trip. </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">You are not seeking the ego; rather you are trying to find out the whole; and the whole is </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">possible only when all sorts of egoistic trips are dropped and sacrificed. When you are </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">not, God is. </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">Let me tell you one very famous Sufi story, "The Holy Shadow." </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">There once lived a saint so good that the angels came from heaven to see how a man </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">could be so godly. This saint went about his daily life diffusing virtue as the stars diffuse </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">light and the flowers scent, without being aware of it. His day could be summed up by </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">two words -- he gave, he forgave -- yet these words never passed his lips. They were </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">expressed in his ready smile, his kindness, forbearance, and charity. </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">The angels said to God, "Lord, grant him the gift of miracles." </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">God replied, "Ask what it is that he wishes." </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">They said to the saint, "Would you like the touch of your hands to heal the sick?" </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">"No," answered the saint. "I would rather God do that." </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">"Would you like to convert guilty souls and bring back wandering hearts to the right </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">path?" </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">"No, that is the angels' mission. It is not for me to convert." </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">"Would you like to become a model of patience, attracting men by the luster of your </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">virtues, and thus glorifying God?" </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">"No," replied the saint. "If men should be attracted to me, they would become estranged </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">from God." "What is it that you desire, then?" asked the angels. </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">"What can I wish for?" asked the saint smiling. "That God gives me his grace; with that </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">would I not have everything?" </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">The angels said, "You must ask for a miracle, or one will be forced upon you." </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">"Very well," said the saint. "That I may do a great deal of good without ever knowing it." </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">The angels were perplexed. They took counsel and resolved upon the following plan: </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">every time the saint's shadow fell behind him or to either side, so that he could not see it, </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">it would have the power to cure disease, soothe pain, and comfort sorrow. </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">When the saint walked along, his shadow, thrown on the ground on either side or behind </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">him, made arid paths green, caused withered plants to bloom, gave clear water to dried-</div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">up brooks, fresh color to pale children, and joy to unhappy men and women. </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">The saint simply went about his daily life diffusing virtue as the stars diffuse light and the </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">flowers scent, without being aware of it. The people, respecting his humility, followed </div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s1_64">him silently, never speaking to him about his miracles. Soon they even forgot his name, </div>
<div id="t16_64" class="t s1_64">and called him "The Holy Shadow." </div>
<div id="t17_64" class="t s1_64">This is the ultimate: one has to become the holy shadow, just a shadow of God. This is </div>
<div id="t18_64" class="t s1_64">the greatest revolution that can happen to a human being: the transfer of the center. You </div>
