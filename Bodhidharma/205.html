<div id="t4_205" class="t s1_205">gives the other cheek or not, stood up and he said, "Now let us see: you have </div>
<div id="t5_205" class="t s1_205">been telling us again and again to give the other cheek." He was a wrestler so the </div>

<div id="tc_205" class="t s1_205">was suddenly surprised and the whole congregation was surprised: the saint </div>
<div id="td_205" class="t s1_205">jumped on the wrestler and started beating him this way and that way. He was </div>
<div id="te_205" class="t s1_205">not expecting it. Although he was a wrestler he forgot; it was so unexpected. He </div>
<div id="tf_205" class="t s1_205">simply could manage to say, "What are you doing?" </div>

<div id="ti_205" class="t s1_205">what it means." </div>

<div id="tn_205" class="t s1_205">on his motorbike, stopped the poor girl and squeezed one of her breasts. This </div>
<div id="to_205" class="t s1_205">they call in Poona, "Hindu culture." </div>

<div id="tr_205" class="t s1_205">of cheeks. She has asked a really profound question, "What do you say, what </div>
<div id="ts_205" class="t s1_205">should I do in such a situation?" </div>
<div id="tt_205" class="t s1_205">But basically the teaching of Christ is only a morality. You don't have to give </div>

<div id="t14_205" class="t s1_205">Her question reminded me about a conference of psychoanalysts. A very old </div>
