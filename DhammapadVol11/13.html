<div id="t1_13" class="t s1_13">forsaken me? Have you forgotten me? Why is all this happening to me?" There must </div>
<div id="t2_13" class="t s1_13">have been a little doubt, just a shadow of doubt. He understood immediately, he </div>
<div id="t3_13" class="t s1_13">apologized. He said, "No, forgive me. Let thy will be done." But for a moment he had </div>
<div id="t4_13" class="t s1_13">wavered. Mansoor never wavered. </div>
<div id="t5_13" class="t s1_13">And he was killed so mercilessly that Jesus' crucifixion seems to be very humane </div>
<div id="t6_13" class="t s1_13">compared to Mansoor's. First his legs were cut off, then his hands were cut off, then his </div>
<div id="t7_13" class="t s1_13">eyes were destroyed, then his tongue was cut off, then his head was cut off. But even </div>
<div id="t8_13" class="t s1_13">though all this suffering was there he was all laughter. </div>
<div id="t9_13" class="t s1_13">Before his tongue was cut off, somebody asked, "Why are you laughing?" </div>
<div id="ta_13" class="t s1_13">He said, "I am laughing because you cannot destroy my experience; whatsoever you do </div>
<div id="tb_13" class="t s1_13">is irrelevant. And I am laughing because you are killing one person and I am somebody </div>
<div id="tc_13" class="t s1_13">else. You are such fools, that's why I am laughing! And I am also laughing at God. I am </div>
<div id="td_13" class="t s1_13">laughing at him, 'You cannot deceive me. In whatsoever form you come I will recognize </div>
<div id="te_13" class="t s1_13">you. I recognize you in the butcher who has cut off my feet, who has cut off my hands. </div>
<div id="tf_13" class="t s1_13">It is you who are in him, and nobody else.'" </div>
<div id="tg_13" class="t s1_13">In fact, Junnaid seems to be a little cowardly; many people think that he was a little </div>
<div id="th_13" class="t s1_13">cowardly. Why should he tell Mansoor to keep it inside? But that is not true -- he was </div>
<div id="ti_13" class="t s1_13">not a coward. In fact, he sacrificed far more than Mansoor. Mansoor's sacrifice is </div>
<div id="tj_13" class="t s1_13">apparent; Junnaid's sacrifice is not apparent, it is very subtle. </div>
<div id="tk_13" class="t s1_13">To contain the truth when it happens is a superhuman feat, it is a miracle. And he tries </div>
<div id="tl_13" class="t s1_13">to contain it so that he can help people. He is a bodhisattva and Mansoor is an arhata. </div>
<div id="tm_13" class="t s1_13">He cares nothing for the work, he cares nothing for anybody else. He has attained, now </div>
<div id="tn_13" class="t s1_13">there is no problem. Death is not a problem at all, he knows he is immortal. </div>
<div id="to_13" class="t s1_13">Junnaid is working silently, in the dark, to help people who are blind. And you don't </div>
<div id="tp_13" class="t s1_13">know HIS suffering. His suffering is that he has to contain something which is </div>
<div id="tq_13" class="t s1_13">uncontainable. </div>
<div id="tr_13" class="t s1_13">Buddha says: DO NOT EXALT YOURSELF</div>
<div id="ts_13" class="t s1_13">....</div>
<div id="tt_13" class="t s1_13">Avoid any exaltation, avoid any </div>
<div id="tu_13" class="t s1_13">declaration -- unless you find it is going to help, unless you find it is going to prepare </div>
<div id="tv_13" class="t s1_13">the way; then it is okay. </div>
<div id="tw_13" class="t s1_13">Buddha himself declared, "I am the most perfect enlightened one." He knew that this </div>
<div id="tx_13" class="t s1_13">was going to help. But if Jesus had asked him he would have said, "No, contain it," </div>
<div id="ty_13" class="t s1_13">because Jesus was in a wrong country with wrong people. To declare there that, "I am </div>
<div id="tz_13" class="t s1_13">God" was just asking for your death, nothing else. </div>
<div id="t10_13" class="t s1_13">Jesus could only work for three years. Hence Christianity is so poor, because the master </div>
<div id="t11_13" class="t s1_13">lived only three years. Up to his thirtieth year he was working for his own </div>
<div id="t12_13" class="t s1_13">enlightenment. When he was ready he came out of the monasteries, started working, </div>
<div id="t13_13" class="t s1_13">and then lived only three years. By the age of thirty-three he was crucified. Now, three </div>
<div id="t14_13" class="t s1_13">years' time is not enough at all. Buddha worked for forty-two years; even that is not </div>
<div id="t15_13" class="t s1_13">enough. </div>
<div id="t16_13" class="t s1_13">If Jesus had asked Buddha, Buddha would have told him, "Keep quiet, work silently. </div>
<div id="t17_13" class="t s1_13">Just be an ordinary rabbi. There is no need to declare that you are the Son of God. You </div>
<div id="t18_13" class="t s1_13">know it, that's enough; and God knows it, that's enough." </div>
