<div id="t1_66" class="t s1_66">Turgenev has written a story, THE FOOL. In a certain town there was a man who was </div>
<div id="t2_66" class="t s1_66">known as the greatest idiot in these parts. He was very much worried because wherever </div>
<div id="t3_66" class="t s1_66">he would go people would laugh at him, whatsoever he would say people would </div>
<div id="t4_66" class="t s1_66">ridicule him. Even if he was saying something right, people would laugh at him </div>
<div id="t5_66" class="t s1_66">because nobody could believe that the idiot could say anything right. It was assumed </div>
<div id="t6_66" class="t s1_66">that he was a perfect idiot. </div>
<div id="t7_66" class="t s1_66">A Sufi mystic was passing through the village. The idiot went to him and he said, "My </div>
<div id="t8_66" class="t s1_66">whole life is wasted -- everybody thinks I am an idiot. Can you help me?" </div>
<div id="t9_66" class="t s1_66">He said, "It is so easy! You just start doing one thing -- you start criticizing, and after </div>
<div id="ta_66" class="t s1_66">seven days you come to me. I will remain here for seven days just for you; within seven </div>
<div id="tb_66" class="t s1_66">days everything will be changed. But you criticize! If somebody quotes Shakespeare, </div>
<div id="tc_66" class="t s1_66">immediately say, 'What is there in it? It is all nonsense, rubbish!' If somebody says, 'The </div>
<div id="td_66" class="t s1_66">moon is beautiful, look!' -- just say, 'What is it? I don't see any beauty. Prove what </div>
<div id="te_66" class="t s1_66">beauty is there!' Nobody can prove it, because beauty cannot be proved. If somebody </div>
<div id="tf_66" class="t s1_66">says, 'What a beautiful morning!' -- immediately jump upon it and start criticizing. You </div>
<div id="tg_66" class="t s1_66">do only one thing for seven days: go around the town and criticize everybody." </div>
<div id="th_66" class="t s1_66">Within seven days the man came back -- not alone, followed by hundreds of people, </div>
<div id="ti_66" class="t s1_66">and they all said, "You have done a miracle! The greatest idiot has become the greatest </div>
<div id="tj_66" class="t s1_66">wise man. Nobody can argue with him." </div>
<div id="tk_66" class="t s1_66">It is easier to criticize, very easy to criticize. It is very difficult to create. </div>
<div id="tl_66" class="t s1_66">And what I am creating is something invisible. Unless you have very sympathetic eyes </div>
<div id="tm_66" class="t s1_66">you will not be able to see it. Unless you fall in rapport with me you will not be able to </div>
<div id="tn_66" class="t s1_66">understand it. </div>
<div id="to_66" class="t s1_66">Father Murphy was a priest in a very poor parish. He asked for some suggestions as to </div>
<div id="tp_66" class="t s1_66">how he could raise money and was told that a racehorse owner always had money. </div>
<div id="tq_66" class="t s1_66">He went to a horse auction, but instead of buying a horse he got a donkey. However, he </div>
<div id="tr_66" class="t s1_66">thought he would enter it in the race and the donkey came in third. The next day the </div>
<div id="ts_66" class="t s1_66">headlines in the paper read, "Father Murphy's ass showed." The archbishop saw the </div>
<div id="tt_66" class="t s1_66">headlines and was displeased. </div>
<div id="tu_66" class="t s1_66">The next day the donkey came in first and the headlines read, "Father Murphy's ass out </div>
<div id="tv_66" class="t s1_66">in front." The archbishop was up in arms and figured something had to be done. Father </div>
<div id="tw_66" class="t s1_66">Murphy had entered the donkey once again and the donkey came in second. </div>
<div id="tx_66" class="t s1_66">The headlines read, "Father Murphy's ass back in place." The archbishop thought this </div>
<div id="ty_66" class="t s1_66">too much, and forbade the priest to enter the donkey in the next race. </div>
<div id="tz_66" class="t s1_66">The next day the headlines read, "Archbishop scratches Father Murphy's ass." </div>
<div id="t10_66" class="t s1_66">The archbishop ordered Father Murphy to get rid of the donkey. He was unable to sell </div>
<div id="t11_66" class="t s1_66">it, so he gave it to Sister Agatha for a pet. When the archbishop heard this he ordered </div>
<div id="t12_66" class="t s1_66">Sister Agatha to dispose of the animal at once. Since she could not give it away, she sold </div>
