<div id="t1_12" class="t s1_12">It is a very paradoxical effort, hence the difficulty. You have to talk to people to help </div>
<div id="t2_12" class="t s1_12">them become silent. You have to talk about silence because people can't understand </div>
<div id="t3_12" class="t s1_12">silence directly. It is very absurd -- talking about silence, teaching people to be silent -- </div>
<div id="t4_12" class="t s1_12">but that has to be done, particularly in the beginning. </div>
<div id="t5_12" class="t s1_12">Second: DO NOT EXALT YOURSELF</div>
<div id="t6_12" class="t s1_12">....</div>
<div id="t7_12" class="t s1_12">It is very natural when you become enlightened. It is not egoistic, it happens very </div>
<div id="t8_12" class="t s1_12">naturally. It has nothing to do with the ego because if the ego is still there you cannot </div>
<div id="t9_12" class="t s1_12">become enlightened. </div>
<div id="ta_12" class="t s1_12">Buddha says: HOLD YOUR TONGUE. DO NOT EXALT YOURSELF... because when </div>
<div id="tb_12" class="t s1_12">you become enlightened the ego HAS disappeared -- you can become enlightened only </div>
<div id="tc_12" class="t s1_12">when you have fulfilled that condition -- but now the experience is so vast, so </div>
<div id="td_12" class="t s1_12">overflowing, so ecstatic that it starts expressing itself. You have to learn</div>
<div id="te_12" class="t s1_12">....</div>
<div id="tf_12" class="t s1_12">It is said of al-Hillaj Mansoor -- who was crucified like Jesus, in a far more inhuman and </div>
<div id="tg_12" class="t s1_12">cruel way than Jesus himself -- it is said about him that the day he became enlightened, </div>
<div id="th_12" class="t s1_12">he shouted, "ANA'L HAQ -- I am the truth! I am God!" </div>
<div id="ti_12" class="t s1_12">His master, Junnaid, was present. He came close to him, whispered in his ear, </div>
<div id="tj_12" class="t s1_12">"Mansoor, keep it inside you. Please keep it inside you! Contain it! I know it is very </div>
<div id="tk_12" class="t s1_12">difficult to contain it -- it is so vast, almost uncontainable. It expresses itself. I know you </div>
<div id="tl_12" class="t s1_12">are not uttering it, it is being uttered by some unknown force, by God himself, but still I </div>
<div id="tm_12" class="t s1_12">say to you, hold your tongue!" </div>
<div id="tn_12" class="t s1_12">And Mansoor promised, "I will hold my tongue." He understood the point, but again </div>
<div id="to_12" class="t s1_12">and again he would forget. Again and again he would come into that same state of </div>
<div id="tp_12" class="t s1_12">inner light, joy, bliss, and again the shout -- the lion's roar, as Buddha used to call it -- </div>
<div id="tq_12" class="t s1_12">would come out of him in spite of himself. </div>
<div id="tr_12" class="t s1_12">He would come and apologize to Junnaid, his master, but the master would say, </div>
<div id="ts_12" class="t s1_12">"Mansoor, something has to be done; otherwise you are going to get into trouble </div>
<div id="tt_12" class="t s1_12">unnecessarily. You could be of great help to humanity, but this way you will be </div>
<div id="tu_12" class="t s1_12">unnecessarily in trouble. And not only you, you will stop my work too. It happened to </div>
<div id="tv_12" class="t s1_12">me too, but I had to contain it and you have to contain it too." </div>
<div id="tw_12" class="t s1_12">But Mansoor was not capable of it. Junnaid sent him to Kaaba for a three-year </div>
<div id="tx_12" class="t s1_12">pilgrimage. "Maybe on this three-year-long journey, being with many mystics, he may </div>
<div id="ty_12" class="t s1_12">cool down. The experience is so new; by and by he will become accustomed to it." But </div>
<div id="tz_12" class="t s1_12">he could not become accustomed to it; when he came back he was again in the same </div>
<div id="t10_12" class="t s1_12">state. He was caught by the king, by the people... because it was a Mohammedan </div>
<div id="t11_12" class="t s1_12">country and it was one of the greatest crimes, the greatest sins, to call oneself God, to </div>
<div id="t12_12" class="t s1_12">declare oneself God. He was killed. </div>
<div id="t13_12" class="t s1_12">For centuries it has been discussed among Sufis who was greater, Junnaid or Mansoor. </div>
<div id="t14_12" class="t s1_12">Ordinarily one would say Mansoor: he was really a great martyr: he suffered and </div>
<div id="t15_12" class="t s1_12">suffered laughingly. He died with laughter. Even Jesus had gone a little forsaken. When </div>
<div id="t16_12" class="t s1_12">the last nail was put in his hands he looked at the sky and said, "God, have you </div>
