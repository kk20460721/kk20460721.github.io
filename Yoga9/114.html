<div id="t3_114" class="t s1_114">about man; man has to become independent. Have you not observed that man is born the </div>

<div id="t7_114" class="t s1_114">That is the whole theory of rebirth, of evolution. In the East we say that every man has </div>

<div id="t9_114" class="t s1_114">were a tree, and once you were a rock also. Then you became man. "Man" means you </div>

<div id="tb_114" class="t s1_114">Adam was "expelled." Hmm?... the word "expulsion" is not good. If we in the East had </div>
<div id="tc_114" class="t s1_114">written the story of the Bible, we would have said, "God sent man farther away from </div>

<div id="te_114" class="t s1_114">around your mother. If you continuously go on living on her milk, it will be impossible to </div>
<div id="tf_114" class="t s1_114">grow. You will remain childish. </div>

<div id="th_114" class="t s1_114">yom mother," you will start thinking of killing your mother. That's how Eve persuaded </div>

<div id="tj_114" class="t s1_114">chose Eve's advice against God's commandment. Simple. He said, "Okay, drop that old </div>

<div id="tl_114" class="t s1_114">And of course women are not very rational; they live by hunches. She has been advised -- </div>
<div id="tm_114" class="t s1_114">by a snake. Hmm?... just look at the absurdity of it -- just a hunch. But when a wife </div>

<div id="tz_114" class="t s1_114">He said, "Certainly. I can see clearly, more dearly. For example, the nurse becomes </div>

<div id="t11_114" class="t s1_114">When you can see clearly, of course the nurse becomes plainer and plainer. When you </div>

<div id="t13_114" class="t s1_114">If everything is clear, then there will be no need to make your eyes clear. The whole thing </div>
<div id="t14_114" class="t s1_114">is this, the whole game is this: things are not clear. So you have to bring more clarity to </div>
<div id="t15_114" class="t s1_114">your mind so you can choose your path. Things are in a chaos. You have to bring </div>
<div id="t16_114" class="t s1_114">awareness within you so you can choose and move rightly into the chaos. Chaos is </div>
<div id="t17_114" class="t s1_114">consideredly there; it is meant to be there. It is not because of the devil the chaos is there; </div>
<div id="t18_114" class="t s1_114">it is because of God. </div>
<div id="t19_114" class="t s1_114">It is like a jigsaw puzzle. Hmm?... if everything is clear then what is the point of the </div>
<div id="t1a_114" class="t s1_114">puzzle? You give a jigsaw puzzle to a small child, you mix all the parts, you confuse the </div>
