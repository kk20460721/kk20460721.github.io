<div id="t2_53" class="t s1_53">who is exactly like you will ever be there again. Hence your religion has to be your </div>
<div id="t3_53" class="t s1_53">religion, your truth has to be your truth. </div>
<div id="t4_53" class="t s1_53">And that is the beauty of truth, that it always comes in such a unique form that you can </div>
<div id="t5_53" class="t s1_53">say, "This is a special gift from God to me." Hence there are so many religions. And it is </div>
<div id="t6_53" class="t s1_53">beautiful! -- there should be many more. Many people have been trying to make one </div>
<div id="t7_53" class="t s1_53">religion; that is utter stupidity. You cannot create one religion. You can enforce one </div>
<div id="t8_53" class="t s1_53">religion on people, but that will destroy their spirit, their freedom; that will cripple their </div>
<div id="t9_53" class="t s1_53">being and paralyze their growth. </div>
<div id="ta_53" class="t s1_53">Just as there are so many languages, there are so many religions. The variety is </div>
<div id="tb_53" class="t s1_53">beautiful, the variety makes it possible for you to choose according to your type. </div>
<div id="tc_53" class="t s1_53">Religion is not and cannot be decided by birth, and those who decide their religion by </div>
<div id="td_53" class="t s1_53">their birth are utter fools. You cannot be born a Hindu and you cannot be born a </div>
<div id="te_53" class="t s1_53">Christian; birth has nothing to do with your religion. Religion is an inquiry. You may be </div>
<div id="tf_53" class="t s1_53">born to Hindu parents -- that is one thing -- but if your parents really love you they will </div>
<div id="tg_53" class="t s1_53">not convert you into a Hindu. Of course they will tell you all they have known and </div>
<div id="th_53" class="t s1_53">experienced, but they will leave you free. And they will tell you, "Become more alert, </div>
<div id="ti_53" class="t s1_53">watchful, mature, and when you are mature enough and you want to decide, choose </div>
<div id="tj_53" class="t s1_53">your own religion." </div>

<div id="tm_53" class="t s1_53">because of variety. There are roses and lotuses and a thousand and one other flowers. </div>
<div id="tn_53" class="t s1_53">Go and choose your own perfume, your own fragrance, because unless you yourself </div>
<div id="to_53" class="t s1_53">choose you will not be dedicated to it, you will not be surrendered to it. </div>

<div id="ts_53" class="t s1_53">understanding, before one can choose. </div>
<div id="tt_53" class="t s1_53">Nobody is born a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Parsi. Everybody is born clean, </div>
<div id="tu_53" class="t s1_53">innocent, a TABULA RASA, and then everyone has to seek and search. This is the </div>
<div id="tv_53" class="t s1_53">beauty of life because life is an inquiry. And don't be settled too early; there is no need. </div>
<div id="tw_53" class="t s1_53">It is possible that no existing religion may satisfy you. But that is good; that means a </div>

<div id="ty_53" class="t s1_53">flower, one more tree -- a new phenomenon. </div>
<div id="tz_53" class="t s1_53">Buddha brings a new religion into the world; the world was poorer before Buddha </div>
<div id="t10_53" class="t s1_53">because it was missing Buddhism. Buddha could have followed the religion of his </div>
<div id="t11_53" class="t s1_53">parents; then the world would have been still poor. The world would have missed </div>
<div id="t12_53" class="t s1_53">something immensely valuable, a new door to God. Buddha opened a new door, a new </div>
<div id="t13_53" class="t s1_53">vision, a new insight. He was not convinced by his parents' religion; otherwise, he </div>
<div id="t14_53" class="t s1_53">would have remained a Hindu. He rebelled. All religious people are rebellious people. </div>
<div id="t15_53" class="t s1_53">He went on an individual search -- all religious people are explorers, all religious </div>
<div id="t16_53" class="t s1_53">people are adventurers. It would have been easy and convenient and comfortable to </div>
<div id="t17_53" class="t s1_53">believe in the religion that had been believed in by the parents and the parents' parents, </div>
