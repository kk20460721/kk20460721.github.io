<div id="t3_173" class="t s1_173">make you only phony, that will make you only pseudo. Existence never repeats </div>
<div id="t4_173" class="t s1_173">anybody. Jesus comes only once, Buddha comes only once. There has never been a </div>
<div id="t5_173" class="t s1_173">person like Buddha before and will never be again, for the simple reason that existence </div>
<div id="t6_173" class="t s1_173">never repeats. </div>
<div id="t7_173" class="t s1_173">You are a totally new manifestation of God. It has never been before so there has never </div>
<div id="t8_173" class="t s1_173">been a person exactly like you. So whomsoever you follow, you will be following </div>
<div id="t9_173" class="t s1_173">somebody who is not like you and you will get into trouble. You can cultivate a certain </div>
<div id="ta_173" class="t s1_173">character around you, you can act, but by acting you are not going to become a buddha. </div>
<div id="tb_173" class="t s1_173">That's what the Buddhist monks have been doing for twenty-five centuries -- acting, </div>
<div id="tc_173" class="t s1_173">performing, literally following. The way Buddha walks they will walk, the way Buddha </div>
<div id="td_173" class="t s1_173">eats they will eat, the way Buddha sits they will sit. You can do all these things and it is </div>
<div id="te_173" class="t s1_173">possible you may do them even better than Buddha, because Buddha was not imitating </div>
<div id="tf_173" class="t s1_173">anybody else; he was spontaneous. When a person is spontaneous he has no time to </div>
<div id="tg_173" class="t s1_173">rehearse it; you will have enough time to rehearse. You may even defeat Buddha in a </div>
<div id="th_173" class="t s1_173">competition. </div>
<div id="ti_173" class="t s1_173">It actually happened once: </div>
<div id="tj_173" class="t s1_173">Friends of Charlie Chaplin were celebrating one of his birthdays and they found a </div>
<div id="tk_173" class="t s1_173">beautiful way to celebrate it. They advertised in the newspapers all over England that </div>
<div id="tl_173" class="t s1_173">there will be a competition and whosoever can imitate Charlie Chaplin will be </div>
<div id="tm_173" class="t s1_173">rewarded. There were three big awards. </div>
<div id="tn_173" class="t s1_173">Many people participated. At least a hundred were chosen from different cities and </div>
<div id="to_173" class="t s1_173">they all gathered in London for the final selection of the three winners. </div>
<div id="tp_173" class="t s1_173">Charlie Chaplin had an idea. He entered in the competition from a different town </div>
<div id="tq_173" class="t s1_173">hoping that he was going to win the first prize -- there was no question about it. But he </div>
<div id="tr_173" class="t s1_173">was wrong; he got the second prize! People came to know only later on that he was also </div>
<div id="ts_173" class="t s1_173">a participant. He was so surprised that somebody managed better than himself. </div>
<div id="tt_173" class="t s1_173">Naturally, the other had practiced it for a long time. Charlie Chaplin was just there </div>
<div id="tu_173" class="t s1_173">being himself; there was no need to practice. He IS Charlie Chaplin, so why practice? </div>
<div id="tv_173" class="t s1_173">What is there to practice? But the other was more polished, more practiced. He walked </div>
<div id="tw_173" class="t s1_173">better than Charlie Chaplin, he talked better than Charlie Chaplin! He outdid him. </div>
<div id="tx_173" class="t s1_173">This is possible. Some Christian monk may defeat Jesus, some Buddhist monk may </div>
<div id="ty_173" class="t s1_173">defeat Buddha. But still, Buddha is Buddha and you will be only an imitator. Still, </div>
<div id="tz_173" class="t s1_173">Charlie Chaplin is Charlie Chaplin and the man who was acting even in a better way is </div>
<div id="t10_173" class="t s1_173">just acting; deep down he is himself. </div>
<div id="t11_173" class="t s1_173">You can never be somebody else. Remember it as one of the most fundamental laws. </div>
<div id="t12_173" class="t s1_173">AES DHAMMO SANANTANO -- this is the eternal law: you can never be like </div>
<div id="t13_173" class="t s1_173">somebody else. That does not mean you should not learn. Learn, but don't follow. </div>
<div id="t14_173" class="t s1_173">Absorb, but go on your own way. Learn from all the enlightened ones. Sit at their feet, </div>
<div id="t15_173" class="t s1_173">absorb their presence, but go on your own way. </div>
