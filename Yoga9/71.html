<div id="t1_71" class="t s1_71">Now, if you are attached to things, you cannot be a lover. Only a nonattached man can </div>
<div id="t2_71" class="t s1_71">raise himself towards that sky which we call love. There is much misunderstanding about </div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s1_71">it. People who leave the world and become detached almost simultaneously become </div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s1_71">loveless also; then something has gone wrong. Because love is the criterion, the very test, </div>
<div id="t5_71" class="t s1_71">the touchstone. If your nonattachment to the world makes you loveless, something has </div>
<div id="t6_71" class="t s1_71">gone sour. Your nonattachment is not true, authentic, real. It is pseudo. Because you are </div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s1_71">afraid of love, that shows you are afraid of being attached, so you avoid all situations </div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s1_71">where love can flower -- because you are afraid deep down that if love flowers you will </div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s1_71">become attached again. </div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s1_71">That's why your so-called mahatmas are afraid of love so much. They will not stay in one </div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s1_71">place for more than three days. Why so much fear? Because if you remain in one place </div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s1_71">for many more days, you will start feeling love for people. Somebody will come every </div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">day to massage your feet, and you will start feeling love for him. Somebody will bring </div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">food for you every day, and you will start feeling love for her. A certain affection will </div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s1_71">arise, and the fear of being attached again: move before you become attached. </div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s1_71">These so-called nonattached people are simply afraid people. They live in deep panic. </div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">They can never touch the real core of life, because it is always touched by love. </div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s1_71">Remember, if your nonattachment to things is true, has come out of understanding, has </div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s1_71">grown out of awareness, you will become more loving. Because the same energy that was </div>
<div id="tk_71" class="t s1_71">involved in attachment will be released. Where will it go? You will have more energy at </div>
<div id="tl_71" class="t s1_71">your disposal. Attachment is not love. It is an ego trip -- to possess, to dominate, to </div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">manipulate. It is violence; it is not love. When this energy is relieved, suddenly you have </div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">much more energy with which to love. A really nonattached person is full of love, and </div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">always and always he has more and more to give, and always he goes on finding new </div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s1_71">sources of love. His source is infinite. </div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s1_71">"By being nonattached TO EVEN THESE POWERS</div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">....</div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">" And the ultimate nonattachment </div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">comes when you have attained some miracles, siddhis, powers, when you can do things -- </div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s1_71">things which are miraculous, things which are unbelievable. If you become attached to </div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s1_71">them, sooner or later you will be back in the world again. Beware. It is the ego's last </div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s1_71">attack on you; don't be caught. The ego is throwing its last net on you. </div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s1_71">"By being nonattached to even these powers, the seed of bondage is destroyed." The seed </div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s1_71">of bondage is attachment. And the seed of liberation is love. And how alike they look. </div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s1_71">They are diametrically opposite: attachment is lovelessness; love is always nonattached. </div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s1_71">Where is the difference? </div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s1_71">You love a woman or a man and you feel attached. Why do you feel attached? </div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s1_71">Attachment means that tomorrow also you would like to have this woman with you, that's </div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s1_71">all. Tomorrow and again the day after tomorrow you would like to have this woman in </div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s1_71">your possession. That simply shows you have not been able to love today; otherwise the </div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s1_71">tomorrow never enters. Who bothers about tomorrow? Who knows about tomorrow? </div>
<div id="t16_71" class="t s1_71">Tomorrow never comes. It enters only into the mind who has not been living today. You </div>
<div id="t17_71" class="t s1_71">have not loved this woman today, so you are waiting for tomorrow to come so that you </div>
<div id="t18_71" class="t s1_71">can love. Your love is incomplete, unfinished. For that unfinished love attachment arises. </div>
<div id="t19_71" class="t s1_71">Then it is natural, logical. You are painting and the painting is incomplete; you would </div>
<div id="t1a_71" class="t s1_71">like to have the canvas tomorrow also, to complete it. </div>
<div id="t1b_71" class="t s1_71">There is a very deep law in life: it wants to complete everything. The bud wants to </div>
<div id="t1c_71" class="t s1_71">flower; the seed wants to become a sprout. </div>
