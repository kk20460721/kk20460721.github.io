<div id="t1_154" class="t s1_154">He was hoping that as he had made a great sacrifice, so he was going to be patted on </div>
<div id="t2_154" class="t s1_154">the back by the master. </div>
<div id="t3_154" class="t s1_154">And do you know what Gurdjieff did? The moment Ouspensky arrived he said, "Put </div>
<div id="t4_154" class="t s1_154">down your money and go back! Leave your money here and go back to London </div>
<div id="t5_154" class="t s1_154">immediately!" </div>
<div id="t6_154" class="t s1_154">This was too much. He became antagonistic. He thought Gurdjieff had become insane. </div>
<div id="t7_154" class="t s1_154">He was not insane. Had Ouspensky followed that too, although it was very illogical</div>
<div id="t8_154" class="t s1_154">....</div>
<div id="t9_154" class="t s1_154">But Ouspensky was a mathematician, a logician, a great intellectual of this century, one </div>
<div id="ta_154" class="t s1_154">of the most profound mathematicians that we have ever produced. He could not believe </div>
<div id="tb_154" class="t s1_154">all this nonsense. He traveled back, but he turned against, turned very sour -- saying </div>
<div id="tc_154" class="t s1_154">that Gurdjieff had gone mad. </div>
<div id="td_154" class="t s1_154">That was his rationalization to avoid seeing the truth, that Gurdjieff was trying to </div>
<div id="te_154" class="t s1_154">destroy his ego totally. That was the last hit on his head. If he had allowed it he would </div>
<div id="tf_154" class="t s1_154">have become enlightened. He missed the point -- and from the last rung of the ladder he </div>
<div id="tg_154" class="t s1_154">missed and fell down. Sometimes it happens: you can miss at the last moment. </div>
<div id="th_154" class="t s1_154">Then for his whole life Ouspensky was talking against Gurdjieff; his name became </div>
<div id="ti_154" class="t s1_154">unmentionable. Whatsoever he was teaching he had learned from Gurdjieff, but he was </div>
<div id="tj_154" class="t s1_154">very secretive. He wouldn't allow his disciples to read Gurdjieff's books. He wouldn't </div>
<div id="tk_154" class="t s1_154">allow his disciples to go and see Gurdjieff. Ouspensky's disciples could see Gurdjieff </div>
<div id="tl_154" class="t s1_154">only after Ouspensky's death; and then they were surprised at how much they had </div>
<div id="tm_154" class="t s1_154">missed. Ouspensky was only a professor, nothing else. Gurdjieff was an enlightened </div>
<div id="tn_154" class="t s1_154">man. </div>
<div id="to_154" class="t s1_154">But the problem is always how to drop the ego. Gurdjieff offended many people in the </div>
<div id="tp_154" class="t s1_154">West for the simple reason that in the West there is no tradition, no background, no </div>
<div id="tq_154" class="t s1_154">context for the psychology of egolessness. </div>
<div id="tr_154" class="t s1_154">That's why I have chosen to be here in the East. Even if people are coming from the </div>
<div id="ts_154" class="t s1_154">West they have to come to ME, because only in the Eastern space is it possible so </div>
<div id="tt_154" class="t s1_154">surrender the ego. The whole milieu is helpful; much effort is not needed. </div>
<div id="tu_154" class="t s1_154">And once the new commune is established it is going to become a very easy </div>
<div id="tv_154" class="t s1_154">phenomenon, a child's play, to drop the ego. When you see ten thousand sannyasins </div>
<div id="tw_154" class="t s1_154">moving without the ego, without a head, you will look foolish with a head. You will be </div>
<div id="tx_154" class="t s1_154">in a hurry immediately so that your head can be cut off and you can also run without a </div>
<div id="ty_154" class="t s1_154">head and do all kinds of things which were not possible before -- because of the head. </div>
<div id="tz_154" class="t s1_154">Gurdjieff is right: the false has to be dropped. The false has to cease for the real to be. </div>
<div id="t10_154" class="t s1_154">The second question: </div>
<div id="t11_154" class="t s1_154">BELOVED MASTER, </div>
<div id="t12_154" class="t s1_154">PLEASE NEVER SPEAK AGAINST THE INDIAN MIND BECAUSE I GET SO ANGRY </div>
<div id="t13_154" class="t s1_154">THAT I START THINKING HOW TO KILL YOU. </div>
<div id="t14_154" class="t s1_154">Deva Kumar, people who only think of killing never kill. You can go on thinking; </div>
<div id="t15_154" class="t s1_154">thinkers can't do anything. And why do you get so much disturbed if I speak against </div>
<div id="t16_154" class="t s1_154">the Indian mind? </div>
