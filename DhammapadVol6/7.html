<div id="t1_7" class="t s1_7">He was very much shocked: "How does he know?" In that shock his eyes were opened. </div>
<div id="t2_7" class="t s1_7">He looked at Buddha: that grace, that beauty, that silence, that light, that love -- he had </div>
<div id="t3_7" class="t s1_7">never seen it anywhere else. He bowed again. </div>
<div id="t4_7" class="t s1_7">Buddha said, "Now it is right, now it is of your heart! Otherwise you were following the </div>
<div id="t5_7" class="t s1_7">advice of your prime minister. Now you are really bowing down because you have seen </div>
<div id="t6_7" class="t s1_7">me." </div>
<div id="t7_7" class="t s1_7">It is rare to find a buddha and more rare to recognize him, because you go on seeing </div>
<div id="t8_7" class="t s1_7">with your old eyes, with your old, stupid mind. Your stupid mind is unable to see </div>
<div id="t9_7" class="t s1_7">buddhahood. It can see only things; it cannot see the immaterial, the mysterious. It can </div>
<div id="ta_7" class="t s1_7">only see the gross, not the subtle. </div>
<div id="tb_7" class="t s1_7">One Friday night Bob came home earlier than usual and surprised his attractive wife in </div>
<div id="tc_7" class="t s1_7">bed with another man. Becoming enraged, he seized a pistol he kept hidden in his </div>
<div id="td_7" class="t s1_7">dresser and shot the lovers to death. </div>
<div id="te_7" class="t s1_7">A next-door neighbor, Jim, was discussing the tragedy with some friends a few days </div>
<div id="tf_7" class="t s1_7">later. Jim said, "Well, after all, it is not the worst thing that could have happened." </div>
<div id="tg_7" class="t s1_7">The others jumped on him. "What do you mean? Two people dead, and Bob may be </div>
<div id="th_7" class="t s1_7">about to be executed!" </div>
<div id="ti_7" class="t s1_7">Jim replied, "Well, I still say it could have been worse. If Bob had come home early on </div>
<div id="tj_7" class="t s1_7">Thursday night, I would be dead!" </div>
<div id="tk_7" class="t s1_7">Man lives in such unconsciousness. He goes on doing things motivated by the </div>
<div id="tl_7" class="t s1_7">unconscious. He is not master of his own soul. He does not know where these desires </div>
<div id="tm_7" class="t s1_7">arise from; they simply possess him. And when he is possessed by a desire, he is utterly </div>
<div id="tn_7" class="t s1_7">helpless. </div>
<div id="to_7" class="t s1_7">The buddha is awake, awake to all that is happening in his being; so alert that nothing </div>
<div id="tp_7" class="t s1_7">can take possession of him, so full of light that no darkness can enter into his own </div>
<div id="tq_7" class="t s1_7">being. He lives in that light, he lives with that awareness. His every movement, his </div>
<div id="tr_7" class="t s1_7">every act, comes out of this consciousness. Hence there is never any repentance in a </div>
<div id="ts_7" class="t s1_7">buddha. He never looks back; there is no point. Each thing that he has done, he has </div>
<div id="tt_7" class="t s1_7">done totally and perfectly. </div>
<div id="tu_7" class="t s1_7">You always have to look back, for the simple reason that you are always partial, </div>
<div id="tv_7" class="t s1_7">fragmentary. Only a part of your being gets involved, and you do everything in such a </div>
<div id="tw_7" class="t s1_7">way that you are not totally in it, never wholly in it. Later on you start thinking, "I </div>
<div id="tx_7" class="t s1_7">should have done that," or "I should have done this," or "maybe a better way of doing it </div>
<div id="ty_7" class="t s1_7">was possible." You start repenting, you start feeling guilty. Your actions are so </div>
<div id="tz_7" class="t s1_7">incomplete, that's why there is this hang-up. When some action is done with your </div>
<div id="t10_7" class="t s1_7">totality, when you are entirely in it, then once you are out of it, you are entirely out of it. </div>
<div id="t11_7" class="t s1_7">Remember this fundamental law: if you are totally into something, you can be totally </div>
<div id="t12_7" class="t s1_7">out of it. If you are not totally in it you will remain involved in it even when the time is </div>
<div id="t13_7" class="t s1_7">past; even when its days are gone you will remain involved in it. Some part of you will </div>
<div id="t14_7" class="t s1_7">go on clinging to the past, and you will always feel miserable. Whatsoever you choose, </div>
