<div id="t1_88" class="t s1_88">consciousness is total, ego is not found at all. And the totality of consciousness is </div>
<div id="t2_88" class="t s1_88">another name for the experience of God. </div>
<div id="t3_88" class="t s1_88">God is not a person, let me remind you again and again -- God is only an experience of </div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s1_88">absolute awareness, of ultimate ecstasy. Hence I say laugh deeply, love deeply, live </div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s1_88">deeply. Risk everything for love, laughter, life. Let your life be a great exploration and </div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s1_88">go on always moving into the unknown and the unknowable. </div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s1_88">Nobody else has used jokes in a spiritual way; hence sometimes people are shocked. </div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s1_88">When they come for the first time to listen to me, naturally they are shocked because </div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s1_88">they want to hear something very serious -- as if they are not serious enough already! </div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">They want to hear something esoteric, something nonsensical, something which makes </div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">no sense to them; then they think there must be great meaning in it. When something is </div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s1_88">incomprehensible to them they think this is great philosophy! Whenever they come </div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s1_88">across something written in stupid jargon, esoteric, occult, spiritual, they become very </div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s1_88">much interested. They think they are going to find some treasure in it. </div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s1_88">The treasure is not hidden in big words, the treasure is hidden in you. And it is to be </div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s1_88">discovered, not through big words, it is to be discovered through wordlessness, it is to </div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s1_88">be discovered through silence. </div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s1_88">And haven't you felt after deep laughter that a sudden silence comes to you in the wake </div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s1_88">of it? -- the silence after a storm. For a moment it is as if the mind stops functioning... </div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s1_88">you are utterly relaxed, in a deep rest. </div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s1_88">Those are the moments, Masta, when you start feeling the presence of God. Those are </div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s1_88">the first glimpses that God is. There is no other proof. </div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s1_88">Hence my commune is going to remain a shock to the traditional people. They have </div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s1_88">seen many spiritual communes, but they were all serious. Jesus will understand what I </div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s1_88">am saying, but not the pope of the Vatican, because these fools go on saying that Jesus </div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s1_88">never laughed. And I tell you, on my own authority, that he must have been one of the </div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s1_88">most hilarious persons. Who else can laugh so beautifully as Jesus? Who else has the </div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s1_88">right? He was not a deadly kind of saint; he lived, and lived very close to the earth. He </div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s1_88">lived with all kinds of ordinary people -- with drunkards and gamblers and tax </div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s1_88">collectors and prostitutes -- and he loved eating and drinking. </div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s1_88">Indian spiritual phonies are very much against drinking. That's why they cannot believe </div>
<div id="tw_88" class="t s1_88">that Jesus is enlightened. Many Jaina monks have asked me, "Why do you say that Jesus </div>
<div id="tx_88" class="t s1_88">is enlightened, as Buddha and Mahavira are? He used to drink wine!" There is nothing </div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s1_88">wrong in it, one just has to learn the art of drinking wine. One should not drink too </div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">much; the golden mean has to be followed. Nobody has ever heard that Jesus was lying </div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s1_88">in the street! He must have known how much to drink and when to drink and when not </div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s1_88">to drink. </div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s1_88">And moreover, wine is absolutely vegetarian; far more vegetarian than milk which </div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s1_88">Hindu, Jaina and Buddhist monks think is the purest food. It is animal food! It is closer </div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s1_88">to nonvegetarian food than to vegetarian food. It is part of the human body or the </div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s1_88">animal body. Wine has nothing wrong in it. And if one is foolish one can drink too </div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s1_88">much water and can get into trouble. So it is not a question of drinking. </div>
