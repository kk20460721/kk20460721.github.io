<div id="t2_52" class="t s1_52">art which is not art at all. It is more a therapy than an art. Look at the modern paintings </div>
<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">and you will be convinced of what I am saying. The painters must be insane; they have </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">poured their insanity on the canvas. It helps them because it releases some tensions </div>
<div id="t5_52" class="t s1_52">inside their being. It is a catharsis, but it is not art. It is therapy through art, but not art </div>
<div id="t6_52" class="t s1_52">itself. </div>
<div id="t7_52" class="t s1_52">If Picasso is prevented from painting, he will go mad. Vincent van Gogh went mad </div>
<div id="t8_52" class="t s1_52">before he committed suicide. And I have been looking into his life deeply and my </div>

<div id="ta_52" class="t s1_52">money to paint. His brother was giving him money enough just to survive, and he was </div>
<div id="tb_52" class="t s1_52">not eating for four days per week. He would eat only for three days and four days he </div>
<div id="tc_52" class="t s1_52">will fast to save money to paint. How long can you do that? But painting was more </div>
<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">important for him than food -- and it ended in madness. He could not paint as much as </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">he wanted, and when he saw that there was no possibility to paint anymore -- the </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">brother is tired, the family is tired and nobody wants to help him and nobody wants to </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">purchase his paintings -- he committed suicide. </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">The same would be the case with Picasso if he was prevented from painting: he would </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">go mad or he would commit suicide. Suicide is the ultimate in insanity. But his </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">paintings are a great help, a great relaxation. </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">And it is not only so with painting; it is so with poetry, music, dance. Everything </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">modern is a little crazy because modern man is a little crazy, off the center. </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">Gurdjieff has divided art into two categories. The modern art he calls subjective art. The </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">ancient art -- the real art -- the people who made the pyramids, the people who made </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">the Taj Mahal, the people who made the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, they were of a </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">totally different kind. He calls that art objective art. Subjective art is like vomiting. You </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">are feeling sick, nauseous; a good vomit helps you to feel good. The poison is thrown </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">out, you feel relieved. It is good for you, but not good for others. </div>

<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">Objective art means something that helps you to become centered, that helps you to </div>

<div id="t10_52" class="t s1_52">tremendous significance. </div>
<div id="t11_52" class="t s1_52">But objective art has disappeared from the world because mystics have disappeared </div>
