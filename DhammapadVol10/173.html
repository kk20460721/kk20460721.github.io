<div id="t6_173" class="t s1_173">The second question: </div>
<div id="t7_173" class="t s1_173">Question 2 </div>
<div id="t8_173" class="t s1_173">BELOVED MASTER, </div>
<div id="t9_173" class="t s1_173">WHAT IS MECHANICAL GOODNESS? </div>
<div id="ta_173" class="t s1_173">Gina Goyt, there is nothing like mechanical goodness. Goodness cannot be mechanical </div>
<div id="tb_173" class="t s1_173">and anything mechanical cannot be good. It is a contradiction in terms. Goodness can </div>
<div id="tc_173" class="t s1_173">only be conscious, nonmechanical; and evil can only be unconscious, mechanical. </div>
<div id="td_173" class="t s1_173">But I understand your question. It is relevant, because for centuries something like </div>
<div id="te_173" class="t s1_173">mechanical goodness has been taught to people because it is easy. People ARE </div>
<div id="tf_173" class="t s1_173">mechanical. To bring real goodness in their lives, real virtue, you will have to transform </div>
<div id="tg_173" class="t s1_173">their unconsciousness into consciousness, you will have to change their darkness into </div>
<div id="th_173" class="t s1_173">light. That is an arduous effort, and the society, moreover, is not interested in it at all. In </div>
<div id="ti_173" class="t s1_173">fact, it is afraid of it because whenever a REALLY good person has happened in the </div>
<div id="tj_173" class="t s1_173">world he has created trouble for the society. </div>
<div id="tk_173" class="t s1_173">A Jesus, a Lao Tzu, a Buddha, a Kabir, these are the greatest rebels for the simple reason </div>
<div id="tl_173" class="t s1_173">that they were so conscious that they could see through the whole stupid game that we </div>
<div id="tm_173" class="t s1_173">go on playing. They could see through our lies, they could see through our deceptions. </div>
<div id="tn_173" class="t s1_173">It was impossible to deceive them and it was impossible to exploit them and it was </div>
<div id="to_173" class="t s1_173">impossible to enslave them. Not only was it impossible to enslave them, but they </div>
<div id="tp_173" class="t s1_173">created great movements of consciousness in the world. They created chains, they </div>
<div id="tq_173" class="t s1_173">triggered chains. Many many people became enlightened through their efforts. Their </div>
<div id="tr_173" class="t s1_173">efforts were thought to be antisocial. That's why Jesus was crucified. </div>
<div id="ts_173" class="t s1_173">Where can you find a man who is more good than Jesus? What was his crime? His </div>
<div id="tt_173" class="t s1_173">crime was that he was REALLY good. If he had been only mechanically good there </div>
<div id="tu_173" class="t s1_173">would have been no trouble. There were many rabbis who were mechanically good. </div>
<div id="tv_173" class="t s1_173">The society is not afraid of mechanical people; they are manageable. They are </div>
<div id="tw_173" class="t s1_173">dependent on the society. They always live with the collective, they are always </div>
<div id="tx_173" class="t s1_173">following the crowd. The crowd is very happy with these people. And it is easy to </div>
<div id="ty_173" class="t s1_173">create mechanical goodness because, in the first place, people ARE mechanical. You </div>
<div id="tz_173" class="t s1_173">have just to replace their evil ideas with good ideas, not changing at all their beings. </div>
<div id="t10_173" class="t s1_173">For example, hell was created -- the idea of hell -- to create mechanical goodness. People </div>
<div id="t11_173" class="t s1_173">are afraid, people live in fear; priests became aware of it in the very beginning of </div>
<div id="t12_173" class="t s1_173">humanity, that it can be exploited: make them more afraid. They depicted hell in such </div>
<div id="t13_173" class="t s1_173">detail, they created so much fear in people, that people became conditioned -- out of </div>
