<div id="t1_67" class="t s1_67">Then simply you can say, 'You are wrong.' Or even that is not needed. You are not a </div>
<div id="t2_67" class="t s1_67">coward; why are you worried about it? Why have you got so red hot? Why are you </div>
<div id="t3_67" class="t s1_67">screaming at the top of your voice? Why have you got so mad? I must have touched </div>
<div id="t4_67" class="t s1_67">something." </div>
<div id="t5_67" class="t s1_67">Now everybody who was present became aware that the man was defending something, </div>
<div id="t6_67" class="t s1_67">and defending very fanatically; but only he could not see it. </div>
<div id="t7_67" class="t s1_67">In a group, if you work for a longer time, by and by you have to become aware that the </div>
<div id="t8_67" class="t s1_67">whole group is seeing that you are doing something foolish, stupid, contrary to your own </div>
<div id="t9_67" class="t s1_67">wishes -- against your own fulfillment, against your own growth. You are clinging to a </div>
<div id="ta_67" class="t s1_67">disease and you go on saying, "I want to get rid of it." </div>
<div id="tb_67" class="t s1_67">Almost everybody knows where you are doing wrong -- except you. Everybody knows </div>
<div id="tc_67" class="t s1_67">that you are an egoist -- except you. Only you think you are a humble man, a simple man. </div>
<div id="td_67" class="t s1_67">Everybody knows your complexity. Everybody knows your double bind. Everybody </div>
<div id="te_67" class="t s1_67">knows your madness except you. You go on defending it. And because of politeness, </div>
<div id="tf_67" class="t s1_67">etiquette, formalities, in the society nobody will tell you. Hence, the group is helpful -- </div>
<div id="tg_67" class="t s1_67">because it is not going to be polite. It is going to be truthful. And when so many people </div>
<div id="th_67" class="t s1_67">say that this is your problem, and pinpoint it and finger it, and put their fingers on your </div>
<div id="ti_67" class="t s1_67">wound and it hurts</div>
<div id="tj_67" class="t s1_67">....</div>
<div id="tk_67" class="t s1_67">It is very difficult to make you alert, individual to individual </div>
<div id="tl_67" class="t s1_67">because you can think this man may be wrong, but twenty persons? The possibility of </div>
<div id="tm_67" class="t s1_67">twenty persons being wrong is less, and you have to fall back on yourself and see the </div>
<div id="tn_67" class="t s1_67">point of it. </div>
<div id="to_67" class="t s1_67">That's why Buddha created a great sangha, a great order of monks -- ten thousand monks. </div>
<div id="tp_67" class="t s1_67">It was the first experiment of group therapy. It was a great experiment. </div>
<div id="tq_67" class="t s1_67">That's what I am doing. Sixteen thousand sannyasins -- one of the greatest experiments in </div>
<div id="tr_67" class="t s1_67">therapy. A community, a commune, in which you have to become aware because, </div>
<div id="ts_67" class="t s1_67">otherwise, you will not be part of this commune, where everybody is understanding and </div>
<div id="tt_67" class="t s1_67">seeing your error and showing it to you. Because sannyasins are not meant to be polite or </div>
<div id="tu_67" class="t s1_67">formal. None of that rubbish. A sannyasin is here to transform himself and become a </div>
<div id="tv_67" class="t s1_67">situation for others' transformation. </div>
<div id="tw_67" class="t s1_67">See, whenever somebody points at some fault about you, don't get angry. That is not </div>
<div id="tx_67" class="t s1_67">going to help you. Don't get mad. That is not going to help you. Try to see the point. </div>
<div id="ty_67" class="t s1_67">Maybe the other is true; and there is more possibility for the other to be true because he is </div>
<div id="tz_67" class="t s1_67">so detached from you, he is so far away from you. He is not involved in you. Always </div>
<div id="t10_67" class="t s1_67">listen to people, what they are saying about you. Ninety-nine percent they will be right; </div>
<div id="t11_67" class="t s1_67">there is only one percent possibility they may be wrong. Otherwise they are not wrong. </div>
<div id="t12_67" class="t s1_67">How can they be wrong, because they have a detached view about you? </div>
<div id="t13_67" class="t s1_67">That's why a Master is needed: to show you your wounds. And it is possible only if you </div>
<div id="t14_67" class="t s1_67">are in deep respect and trust. If you get angry and you start fighting, then there is no trust </div>
<div id="t15_67" class="t s1_67">and no respect. If you are here to defend your illnesses and diseases, then it is for you -- </div>
<div id="t16_67" class="t s1_67">don't be here. What is the point of wasting your time here? </div>
<div id="t17_67" class="t s1_67">If I say that you are a coward and you cannot see the point, rather you have to fight and </div>
<div id="t18_67" class="t s1_67">prove to me that you are not, then, simply there is no point of being here. The relationship </div>
<div id="t19_67" class="t s1_67">is finished with me. Now I cannot be helpful to you. When I say something to you, you </div>
<div id="t1a_67" class="t s1_67">have to look into the fact. Why should I call you a coward? There is no investment with </div>
<div id="t1b_67" class="t s1_67">you, and I have not invested anything in your cowardness. I simply said so because of </div>
