<div id="t1_73" class="t s1_73">interpreted in an ordinary way. His language is not ordinary. The words may be </div>
<div id="t2_73" class="t s1_73">ordinary, but his meaning never is. He is saying to his disciples,'Be in zazen.' </div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s1_73">Let me explain to you what zazen is. Zazen is a deep unoccupiedness -- not </div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s1_73">doing anything outwardly, not doing anything inwardly. It is not even </div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s1_73">meditation because when you meditate you are making some sort of effort, you </div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s1_73">are trying to do something: chanting a mantra, remembering God, or even </div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s1_73">remembering yourself. But these efforts create ripples, these efforts create </div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s1_73">vibrations and your sitting becomes corrupted. Then your sitting is not innocent. </div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s1_73">Zazen means: sit, and just sit, nothing else. There is no doing on the part of the </div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s1_73">body, no doing on the part of the mind. It's a state of non-doing. That does not </div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s1_73">mean that you are fast asleep, because sleep is a doing. That does not mean that </div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s1_73">you are dead, because if you are dead you cannot just sit. That simply means that </div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s1_73">you are tremendously alive, intensely alive, a fire of being, but not moving </div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s1_73">anywhere -- a reservoir of energy in a deep awaiting. You are just waiting for </div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s1_73">something to happen, not even expecting, because expectation will again create a </div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s1_73">ripple of thought and the mind will start functioning. Everything is suspended. </div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s1_73">You breathe, and that's all that you do. But that is not a doing, because breathing </div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s1_73">goes on its own accord. You have not to do anything but just sit silently. </div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s1_73">It is said about Bodhidharma that he sat for nine years facing the wall of his cave. </div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s1_73">The story says that his legs withered away. Nine years sitting silently, not doing </div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s1_73">anything: he was not chanting a mantra, he was not remembering any God, he </div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s1_73">was not doing any prayer. He was just sitting, facing a wall. His legs withered </div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s1_73">away. It is very significant, because legs are symbolic of activity, of movement. </div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s1_73">All movement disappeared. Whether his legs actually withered away or not is </div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s1_73">not the point. The point is that all movement disappeared. The consciousness </div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s1_73">became an unmoving reservoir of energy, just pure energy not going anywhere. </div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s1_73">Then came his first disciple, because he would not accept any disciple unless he </div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s1_73">showed a tremendous intensity to follow. Hui Kujo came. It is said that he cut off </div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s1_73">his hand and offered it to Bodhidharma, and said,'Turn towards me, otherwise I </div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s1_73">will cut off my head.' </div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s1_73">Bodhidharma had to turn. That was the first movement he had made in nine </div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s1_73">years. He said,'Wait -- so the man has come to whom I can deliver my message.' </div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s1_73">Again it may or it may not be that the disciple offered his hand. Again, it is a </div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s1_73">symbol: hands mean activity. Legs mean movement, hands mean activity. With </div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s1_73">activity offered, only then is being revealed. Bodhidharma gave his message, his </div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s1_73">all, to this man who had symbolically shown that he was ready to lose activity. </div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s1_73">When Jesus said to his disciples,'Sit ye here,' he meant zazen: that,'You simply sit </div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s1_73">and wait, because a tremendous event is on the way. Something is going to </div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s1_73">happen that I will never be repeated again in the whole history of man. </div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s1_73">Something unrepeatable, something unique is on the way. You wait, sit, and </div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s1_73">watch. Don't make any movement, because even a slight movement of thought, </div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s1_73">emotion, body, and you may miss the point. The son of man is going to be </div>
