<div id="t2_13" class="t s1_13">fulfilled. You think of food and food will be there, instantly. You think of a bed </div>
<div id="t3_13" class="t s1_13">because you are feeling sleepy -- instantly the bed will be there. </div>
<div id="t4_13" class="t s1_13">This is what the womb is. Womb is a kalptaru, a wish-fulfilling tree. The child </div>
<div id="t5_13" class="t s1_13">never becomes aware of any need. Before he becomes aware it is fulfilled. It is </div>
<div id="t6_13" class="t s1_13">absolutely automatic. But the child has to leave the womb; it is needed for his </div>
<div id="t7_13" class="t s1_13">growth. Because comfort alone can never help you to grow, because there is no </div>

<div id="t9_13" class="t s1_13">to do after leaving the womb is the basis of all survival -- he will have to breathe </div>
<div id="ta_13" class="t s1_13">on his own. He will have to make effort on his own. He is becoming a shramana. </div>
<div id="tb_13" class="t s1_13">In the mother's womb he was a brahmin. Everything was happening by grace. </div>
<div id="tc_13" class="t s1_13">Everything was happening, he was not doing anything. But everybody has to </div>
<div id="td_13" class="t s1_13">come out of the womb. Every brahmin has to become a shramana. Buddha says </div>
<div id="te_13" class="t s1_13">through being a shramana, growth is possible. </div>
<div id="tf_13" class="t s1_13">Then the child by and by grows farther away, farther away from the mother. </div>
<div id="tg_13" class="t s1_13">After the birth he will still have to depend on the breast of the mother. Then a </div>
<div id="th_13" class="t s1_13">moment will come when he will no more depend on the breast either, but still he </div>
<div id="ti_13" class="t s1_13">will depend on the mother to feed him. Then he will go to school. He is going </div>
<div id="tj_13" class="t s1_13">farther away from the mother, he is becoming more and more independent, he is </div>
<div id="tk_13" class="t s1_13">becoming more and more an individual. Then one day he falls in love with </div>
<div id="tl_13" class="t s1_13">another woman and he is cut off from the mother completely. </div>
<div id="tm_13" class="t s1_13">That's why no mother can ever forgive the woman who has taken away her son. </div>
<div id="tn_13" class="t s1_13">Never -- it is impossible for the mother to forgive the woman who has taken </div>

<div id="tp_13" class="t s1_13">love with a woman, because then he has turned his back towards his mother </div>
<div id="tq_13" class="t s1_13">completely. Now he has turned one hundred and eighty degrees. </div>
<div id="tr_13" class="t s1_13">Buddha says that in the psychological world still many roots have to be cut. You </div>
<div id="ts_13" class="t s1_13">should become more and more aware that you may have come far away from the </div>
<div id="tt_13" class="t s1_13">mother, but then you create psychological mothers. You may have come far </div>
<div id="tu_13" class="t s1_13">away from the father, but then you create a father figure in the heaven -- god </div>
<div id="tv_13" class="t s1_13">ruling all over the world, the supreme sovereign. And you call him father. Again </div>
<div id="tw_13" class="t s1_13">you are trying to become dependent -- as if you are afraid of your independence. </div>
<div id="tx_13" class="t s1_13">All these are roots; all the roots have to be cut. </div>
<div id="ty_13" class="t s1_13">Jesus says somewhere... and I suspect that he must have got those ideas from </div>
<div id="tz_13" class="t s1_13">some buddhist source, because Jesus came five hundred years after Buddha, and </div>
<div id="t10_13" class="t s1_13">by the time Jesus came, buddhist attitudes had spread all over the Middle East. </div>

<div id="t13_13" class="t s1_13">Jesus was brought up in Egypt. He must have come to know. And there is every </div>
