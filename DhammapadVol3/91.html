<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">these are likes, different likes. One loves to swim, somebody else loves to philosophize... </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">there is nothing higher and nothing lower. </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">But we have made a society on a hierarchical pattern. The brahmin is at the top -- the </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">brahmin means the professor, the academician, the Nobel Prize winner, the famous </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">doctor, the famous engineer, the scholar. That is the meaning of the brahmin -- he is the </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">highest. Why? Why is not the woodcutter the highest? If the woodcutter enjoys his </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">chopping of wood more than the professor enjoys his teaching, who is higher? The </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">professor may be simply dragging, repeating every time, every year, the same thing. </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">I used to know a professor who was repeating the same lectures at least for thirty years. </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">I had heard it, and his other students had told me that exactly the same lectures, word </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">for word</div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">....</div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">So one day, when the professor was asleep in the afternoon, I went into his </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">house. I looked into his books, found the book in which he had collected all the lectures, </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">and stole it. </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">You cannot believe what happened to the professor! He didn't turn up the next day. I </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">inquired after him; he said, "I am shattered, my life is finished -- somebody has stolen </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">my book, and I cannot speak without it. I have been using the same notes for thirty </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">years! Now I cannot make again new notes." </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">I could see the poor man; he was just functioning like a gramophone record. There was </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">no need of him. I gave him the book and I said, "Why do you bother to come to the </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">university at all? You can simply send this book, one of us can read it, and others can </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">take notes. Why do you bother in your old age to come to the university again and </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">again? This book will do! You can die in peace. This book is enough. You don't have to </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">live at all -- there is no need." </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">Now, this professor is a brahmin; he is the highest because the head is thought to be the </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">highest. It IS on the top, maybe that's why the idea has arisen that the head and the </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">head people are the topmost people. The bosses are called "heads" and the servants are </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">called "hands"! Why? Just because physically the head is on top...? </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">We have created hierarchy in society. The lowest are those poor people who are </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">chopping wood or cleaning the roads. Why are they the lowest? -- because they are </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">doing the most essential things. The professors can be discarded, the society can exist </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">without them; but the society cannot exist without the street cleaners, the toilet cleaners, </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">the woodchoppers -- the society cannot exist without them. They are far more essential, </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">far more fundamental, but they are the lowest. </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">The whole idea is wrong. There is no hierarchy. The professor is doing his work, and </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">the woodcutter is doing his work, and both are needed. Neither is there a hierarchy </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">between men and other animals, nor is there a hierarchy between men and men. I am </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">against the whole idea of hierarchy. </div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s1_91">And that's my vision of a new commune. </div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">In the new commune there is going to be nobody higher and nobody lower. In this </div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s1_91">ashram, there is nobody higher, nobody lower. There are toilet cleaners and there are </div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s1_91">professors, therapists, and they are all the same -- they are all doing some useful work, </div>
