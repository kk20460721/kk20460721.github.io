<div id="t1_49" class="t s1_49">CHAPTER 3. A ROLLING STONE</div>
<div id="t2_49" class="t s2_49">Now, this is stupid, because there are ways you can forget yourself for ever. Suﬁsm is one of the</div>
<div id="t3_49" class="t s2_49">ways – you can drown yourself for ever. There is no need to search for drugs. Suﬁsm gives you the</div>
<div id="t4_49" class="t s2_49">ultimate drug: God himself. Once the ego is gone for ever, there is no pain, no agony, no suffering,</div>
<div id="t5_49" class="t s2_49">no hell.</div>
<div id="t6_49" class="t s2_49">This is the way Ramana Maharshi experienced the sudden opening into ultimate consciousness, in</div>
<div id="t7_49" class="t s2_49">which his individual identity was almost entirely lost. A family relation had died, and young Ramana</div>
<div id="t8_49" class="t s2_49">decided to explore directly the experience of death. His motive stemmed more from curiosity than</div>
<div id="t9_49" class="t s2_49">any feeling of bereavement. Ramana removed all his clothes, lay on the ﬂoor of his room, and with</div>
<div id="ta_49" class="t s2_49">tremendous intensity, imagined his body dead.</div>
<div id="tb_49" class="t s2_49">He closed his eyes, simulating the state of deep</div>
<div id="tc_49" class="t s2_49">sleep. Suddenly there ﬂashed into view, timeless and complete, the primal awareness that lies at</div>
<div id="td_49" class="t s2_49">the source of our being, the ultimate consciousness that is the source of being itself. And when he</div>
<div id="te_49" class="t s2_49">opened his eyes, he was totally a different man.</div>
<div id="tf_49" class="t s2_49">What happened? Somebody had died, a relation. Ramana was only seventeen. He was not a very</div>
<div id="tg_49" class="t s2_49">extraordinary student or anything – nothing special about him, except one thing and that was his</div>
<div id="th_49" class="t s2_49">deep sleep. So deep was his sleep that it was almost impossible to wake him up. The family was</div>
<div id="ti_49" class="t s2_49">tired. You could go on shouting, pulling him from the bed</div>
<div id="tj_49" class="t s2_49">....</div>
<div id="tk_49" class="t s2_49">And sometimes the sleep used to come</div>
<div id="tl_49" class="t s2_49">any time of the day – he might fall asleep in the school, and the children had to carry him back to his</div>
<div id="tm_49" class="t s2_49">home. That was his only speciality. Other children would be playing and he would fall asleep on the</div>
<div id="tn_49" class="t s2_49">ground, and they would poke, and they would pummel and they would beat him, and he would not</div>
<div id="to_49" class="t s2_49">be there at all. And they would have to carry him home.</div>
<div id="tp_49" class="t s2_49">That was his only speciality, but of great signiﬁcance, because deep sleep is very close to samadhi,</div>
<div id="tq_49" class="t s2_49">just the threshold of samadhi. That has been my speciality too.</div>
<div id="tr_49" class="t s2_49">It was almost a problem in my college in university – because I would fall asleep. My teachers were</div>
<div id="ts_49" class="t s2_49">very angry, because who wants somebody falling asleep? And I was a student of philosophy, and</div>
<div id="tt_49" class="t s2_49">there were not many people because very few people go to study philosophy. In my MA class we</div>
<div id="tu_49" class="t s2_49">were only three students, Sol would be sleeping just in front of the teacher. And he would come and</div>
<div id="tv_49" class="t s2_49">shake me up.</div>
<div id="tw_49" class="t s2_49">Sometimes it would happen that I would be the only person, the other two had not come. And just</div>
<div id="tx_49" class="t s2_49">looking at me he would say, ”Finished! You go home. And I will go home, I can sleep myself. What</div>
<div id="ty_49" class="t s2_49">is the point?”</div>
<div id="tz_49" class="t s2_49">Deep sleep is the threshold.</div>
<div id="t10_49" class="t s2_49">That’s why this incident was possible.</div>
<div id="t11_49" class="t s2_49">Somebody died; Ramana</div>
<div id="t12_49" class="t s2_49">was only seventeen and he thought, ”What is death? Let me experience it.” He threw his clothes,</div>
<div id="t13_49" class="t s2_49">simulated death, fell on the ﬂoor. He had seen the relative lying on the ﬂoor; so just the same way</div>
<div id="t14_49" class="t s2_49">he fell on the ﬂoor, closed his eyes, and started thinking, ”I am dying, I am dying, I am dying.”</div>
<div id="t15_49" class="t s2_49">And he died! The ego disappeared. And here the ego disappeared and there God appeared – the</div>
<div id="t16_49" class="t s2_49">primal awareness. And when he opened his eyes he was no more the same person. He left the</div>
<div id="t17_49" class="t s2_49">home, immediately, without saying anything to anybody. It was not a renunciation. He simply left the</div>
<div id="t18_49" class="t s2_49">home because there was no point. It was not that he was against the world or anything. There was</div>
<div id="t19_49" class="t s2_49">no point any more. He went out and NEVER came back. The mother searched for him for years;</div>
<div id="t1a_49" class="t s2_49">ﬁnally, after ten years, she found him in Arunachal in a mountain cave. But he was a totally different</div>
<div id="t1b_49" class="t s2_49">man. And the mother asked him, ”Why didn’t you inform me?”</div>
<div id="t1c_49" class="t s2_49">The Perfect Master, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t1d_49" class="t s2_49">49</div>
