<div id="t1_129" class="t s1_129">Buddhist rule is: Don't look more than four feet ahead. Such fear... and he must have </div>
<div id="t2_129" class="t s1_129">been trembling inside. And he crossed the river. </div>
<div id="t3_129" class="t s1_129">When he was crossing the river and was reaching the other shore, suddenly he </div>
<div id="t4_129" class="t s1_129">remembered his younger fellow monk, who was also coming behind. What has </div>
<div id="t5_129" class="t s1_129">happened to him? He looked back. The younger monk was carrying the woman on his </div>
<div id="t6_129" class="t s1_129">shoulders! The older one was really enraged; in his rage there must have been jealousy </div>
<div id="t7_129" class="t s1_129">also; otherwise why be angry? </div>
<div id="t8_129" class="t s1_129">The younger one brought the girl to the other shore, left her there, and both the monks </div>
<div id="t9_129" class="t s1_129">moved towards the monastery. For one mile the old man didn't say a single word. </div>
<div id="ta_129" class="t s1_129">Then, when they reached to the gate of the monastery, the old man turned to the </div>
<div id="tb_129" class="t s1_129">younger monk and said, "Listen, I will have to report it to the abbot. This is against the </div>
<div id="tc_129" class="t s1_129">rules. Buddha has said: Don't touch a woman, don't look at a woman. You have not </div>
<div id="td_129" class="t s1_129">only seen her, you have not only touched her, you have carried her on your shoulders. </div>
<div id="te_129" class="t s1_129">This is too much! This is going against the law." </div>
<div id="tf_129" class="t s1_129">I don't think that Buddha has said that. A man like Buddha cannot say such nonsense </div>
<div id="tg_129" class="t s1_129">things. But twenty-five centuries of stupid interpreters have done as much harm as they </div>
<div id="th_129" class="t s1_129">can do. </div>
<div id="ti_129" class="t s1_129">The young monk said, "But I have left the woman on the bank, far behind. Are you still </div>
<div id="tj_129" class="t s1_129">carrying her on your shoulders?" </div>
<div id="tk_129" class="t s1_129">It has a great truth in it: the old man was really still carrying her. You can see without </div>
<div id="tl_129" class="t s1_129">seeing, you can carry without carrying, you can touch without touching. Man has great </div>
<div id="tm_129" class="t s1_129">imagination. </div>
<div id="tn_129" class="t s1_129">Hence I cannot believe that Surdas destroyed his eyes; otherwise it would be impossible </div>
<div id="to_129" class="t s1_129">for him to give such beautiful insights. He must have been a man of inner vision, of </div>
<div id="tp_129" class="t s1_129">inner eyes, of great understanding. So I don't believe in the story, but the story is </div>
<div id="tq_129" class="t s1_129">significant. It is true about so many so-called saints. It may not be true about Surdas but </div>
<div id="tr_129" class="t s1_129">it is true about almost all so-called saints -- Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian. </div>
<div id="ts_129" class="t s1_129">In Christianity there has been a sect which used to cut off their genital organs -- just in </div>
<div id="tt_129" class="t s1_129">order to transcend sex. If just by cutting off your genital organs you can transcend sex, </div>
<div id="tu_129" class="t s1_129">things will be very easy. You can just go to the Sassoon Hospital and they will really do </div>
<div id="tv_129" class="t s1_129">a butchery on you! They are official butchers, government butchers, recognized, </div>
<div id="tw_129" class="t s1_129">authorized. But by removing your sexual organs you will not transcend sex; you may </div>
<div id="tx_129" class="t s1_129">become more obsessed with sex than ever before. </div>
<div id="ty_129" class="t s1_129">That's what happens to old people -- hence the expression, 'the dirty old man'. You </div>
<div id="tz_129" class="t s1_129">don't say 'the dirty young man' -- why? The old man is called dirty for the simple </div>
<div id="t10_129" class="t s1_129">reason that now all his sexuality has entered into his mind. His sex center has moved </div>
<div id="t11_129" class="t s1_129">into his mind; it has become cerebral. Now he thinks about it only, he continually thinks </div>
<div id="t12_129" class="t s1_129">about it. Physiologically he has become incapable; that does not mean that </div>
<div id="t13_129" class="t s1_129">psychologically he has transcended it, that he has mastery of his sexuality -- no. </div>
<div id="t14_129" class="t s1_129">By destroying your senses you don't, you can't become masters. Then what is the way </div>
<div id="t15_129" class="t s1_129">to become the master? </div>
