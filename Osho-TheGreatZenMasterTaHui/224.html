<div id="t1_224" class="t s1_224">Devadatta, that did not make even a dent in the great commune that Gautam Buddha had</div>
<div id="t2_224" class="t s1_224">created.</div>
<div id="t3_224" class="t s1_224">These five hundred were the people who were also ambitious, who wanted position, who</div>
<div id="t4_224" class="t s1_224">wanted to be declared enlightened -- although they were not enlightened -- and who were</div>
<div id="t5_224" class="t s1_224">jealous of people who were being declared as enlightened. These were the people who had</div>
<div id="t6_224" class="t s1_224">entered the great commune of Gautam Buddha with some egoistic ambition -- they left.</div>
<div id="t7_224" class="t s1_224">But Devadatta could not sit silently; he had not left just to retire to the Himalayas. He</div>
<div id="t8_224" class="t s1_224">started conspiring against Gautam Buddha. He made many efforts to kill him. And that's what</div>
<div id="t9_224" class="t s1_224">I wanted to tell you about. He had caught a mad elephant, not knowing that that elephant used</div>
<div id="ta_224" class="t s1_224">to be a friend of Gautam Buddha when he was a child. It had belonged to Gautam Buddha's</div>
<div id="tb_224" class="t s1_224">royal palace, and it was so heartbroken when Gautam Buddha left the palace that it simply</div>
<div id="tc_224" class="t s1_224">escaped to the forest and started behaving in a crazy way -- the shock was too much. He had</div>
<div id="td_224" class="t s1_224">loved him as a child, and they were really great friends. They were always moving together; in</div>
<div id="te_224" class="t s1_224">the great garden near the river they were always found together.</div>
<div id="tf_224" class="t s1_224">It was almost forty years afterwards that Devadatta found this mad elephant in the forest.</div>
<div id="tg_224" class="t s1_224">He managed to catch hold of it, and he thought that this would be a great opportunity; he</div>
<div id="th_224" class="t s1_224">would take it to where Gautam Buddha meditates under a tree and leave it there, because that</div>
<div id="ti_224" class="t s1_224">elephant has killed many people ... He was not aware that that elephant had gone mad because</div>
<div id="tj_224" class="t s1_224">Gautam Buddha had left him forty years before.</div>
<div id="tk_224" class="t s1_224">So the elephant rushed at Gautam Buddha, and he would have killed him. But as he</div>
<div id="tl_224" class="t s1_224">recognized Buddha, all his madness disappeared. He bowed down, touched Buddha's feet with</div>
<div id="tm_224" class="t s1_224">his head, and sat at his feet, putting his head in his lap. Forty years of separation ...! Buddha</div>
<div id="tn_224" class="t s1_224">opened his eyes and he could not believe that his old, old friend ... he had forgotten! And</div>
<div id="to_224" class="t s1_224">Devadatta could not believe it. He thought it was a miracle. He became so afraid that after that</div>
<div id="tp_224" class="t s1_224">he stopped making any effort to kill Gautam Buddha. But he had no idea what had really</div>
<div id="tq_224" class="t s1_224">happened. It was not a miracle; it was simply the memory of the elephant.</div>
<div id="tr_224" class="t s1_224">A person who is coming from the body of an elephant into the body of a man will have a</div>
<div id="ts_224" class="t s1_224">tremendous memory. In the same way, all the animals have their own special talents. I am</div>
<div id="tt_224" class="t s1_224">saying this for the first time -- that every human being has come from a different animal.</div>
<div id="tu_224" class="t s1_224">Charles Darwin's idea that all have come from the monkeys is wrong. If it was so, then all will</div>
<div id="tv_224" class="t s1_224">show the same characteristics -- which is not so.</div>
<div id="tw_224" class="t s1_224">A dog can be born as a human being, or may go through a few other life-forms -- may</div>
<div id="tx_224" class="t s1_224">become a lion, may become a deer and then come as a human being. But if he comes from a</div>
<div id="ty_224" class="t s1_224">lion, then he will have tremendous courage; then he will have the courage to be a rebel. If he</div>
<div id="tz_224" class="t s1_224">is coming from a sheep, he will become a Christian -- particularly a Catholic -- because a</div>
<div id="t10_224" class="t s1_224">sheep cannot do anything else. You cannot say that Jesus Christ was wrong when he said, "I</div>
<div id="t11_224" class="t s1_224">am the shepherd and you are my sheep" -- he must have recognized that all these guys have</div>
<div id="t12_224" class="t s1_224">come from sheep.</div>
<div id="t13_224" class="t s1_224">Charles Darwin's idea is right, but not in the details; in the details he has not been able to</div>
<div id="t14_224" class="t s1_224">work it out. I agree with him on this essential point that man has evolved out of animals, but I</div>
<div id="t15_224" class="t s1_224">don't agree with him that all human beings have evolved from the same animal -- monkey,</div>
<div id="t16_224" class="t s1_224">ape, or chimpanzee. Human beings have come from all different directions. It is a gathering of</div>
<div id="t17_224" class="t s1_224">all kinds of animals, and if you watch people you can find from where each person is coming.</div>
<div id="t18_224" class="t s1_224">Just a little watchfulness is needed, alertness, and you can feel that this man seems to be</div>
<div id="t19_224" class="t s1_224">related to a certain species.</div>
<div id="t1a_224" class="t s1_224">Chapter 18 - No guilt</div>
<div id="t1b_224" class="t s1_224">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1c_224" class="t s1_224">224</div>
