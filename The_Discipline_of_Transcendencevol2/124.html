<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">A Buddha is not defined by his personality. He is defined by the ultimate state of </div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">his being, which is beyond personality. And when a Buddha speaks, he does not </div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">speak like a person. He speaks through his ultimate awareness. In fact to say that </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">he speaks is not good, not right. There is nobody to speak, there is no self in him </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">to speak. And in fact he has nothing to say. He simply responds. Just as if you go </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">and start singing in a valley the valley responds. The valley simply echoes you. </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">When you come to a Buddha, he simply mirrors you. Whatsoever he speaks is </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">just a reflection. It is an answer to you, but he has nothing to say himself. If </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">another Buddha comes to him, they both will remain absolutely silent, two </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">mirrors facing each other... nothing will be reflected. The mirrors will reflect each </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">other, but nothing will be reflected. Two mirrors -- just think of two mirrors </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">facing each other. If Christ comes to see Buddha, or Buddha somewhere on the </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">roads of life comes across Lao Tzu, they will be absolutely silent -- there will be </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">no echo. </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">So when Buddha is speaking, remember it. He is not saying anything in </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">particular. He is simply reflecting the people. That's why a Buddha can never be </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">very consistent. A philosopher can be very consistent. He has something to say. </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">He remembers it, he clings with it, he never says anything that goes against it... </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">he manages. A Buddha is bound to be contradictory because each time </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">somebody faces him, something else will arise. It will depend on the person who </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">faces him. </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">It is just like a mirror. If you come before the mirror, it is your face. Somebody </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">else comes, then it is his face. The face will go on changing. You cannot say to the </div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s1_124">mirror, 'You are very inconsistent. Sometimes you show a woman's face and </div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">sometimes a man's face, and sometimes a beautiful face and sometimes an ugly </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">face. The mirror will simply keep quiet. What can he do? He simply reflects. He </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">reflects whatsoever is the case. </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">So buddhist sayings are very contradictory. Jesus is contradictory, Buddha is </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">contradictory, Krishna is contradictory, Lao Tzu is tremendously contradictory. </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">Hegel is not contradictory, Kant is not contradictory, Russell is not contradictory, </div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">Confucius is not contradictory, Manu is not contradictory. They have a certain </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">dogma. They don't reflect you. They have something to say. They go on saying. </div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">They are not like mirrors, they are like a photograph. It doesn't bother who you </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">are; it remains the same. It is dead. It has a clearcut definition and form. </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">Buddhahood is a formless awareness. Remember it, otherwise many times you </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">will come across contradictions and you will not be able to figure out what is </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">happening. </div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">When Buddha died, immediately there was much controversy, and the followers </div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">divided into many sects. Because somebody had heard Buddha saying this, and </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">somebody had heard something absolutely contradicting it. So there was no </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">possibility. How can one man say all those things? So, somebody must be lying... </div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s1_124">and people started sorting out. They sorted out in many different schools. </div>
