<div id="t7_121" class="t s1_121">because he walked there. Bihar means 'where Buddha walks'. Now the whole </div>
<div id="t8_121" class="t s1_121">place is called Bihar. Now we go on claiming. Nehru took his bones back, </div>
<div id="t9_121" class="t s1_121">brought his bones back to India. Nehru was not a religious person at all, not at </div>

<div id="te_121" class="t s1_121">theories. They are very empirical, pragmatic: Buddha was a very pragmatic man. </div>
