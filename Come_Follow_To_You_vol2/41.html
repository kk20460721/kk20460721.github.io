<div id="t4_41" class="t s1_41">Jesus was crucified just so that the proof was destroyed that a man can be so </div>

<div id="t7_41" class="t s1_41">whenever there is proof, you destroy it. </div>
<div id="t8_41" class="t s1_41">Jesus was the proof. If you could have understood him, you could have </div>

<div id="tc_41" class="t s1_41">on living in your miserable holes? You will have to come out into the light. </div>
<div id="td_41" class="t s1_41">It is better to deny God than to come out of your darkness, because you have </div>

<div id="tm_41" class="t s1_41">I have been watching him all these years. He fell ill because he was defeated in </div>
<div id="tn_41" class="t s1_41">one election. His illness was psychological: he could not accept the fact that he </div>
<div id="to_41" class="t s1_41">could be defeated. His ego was shattered; he fell ill. The body was simply </div>
