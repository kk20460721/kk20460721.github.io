<div id="t1_120" class="t s1_120">ORGANUM, 'I am bringing the very base of all knowledge.' And it is not </div>
<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">egoistic; the book is really rare. </div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">The whole effort of Gurdjieff depended on a deep cooperation between </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">Ouspensky and himself. He was to lead and Ouspensky was to formalize it, to </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">formulate it, to give it a structure. The soul was to come from Gurdjieff and the </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">body was to be supplied by Ouspensky, and Ouspensky betrayed him in the </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">middle. He simply left Gurdjieff. That was always a possibility because he was </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">such an intellectual and Gurdjieff was absolutely anti intellectual. It was almost </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">an impossibility that they would continue their cooperation. </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">Gurdjieff demanded absolute surrender -- as Masters have al ways demanded; </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">and that was difficult for Ouspensky -- as it is always difficult for every disciple. </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">And it is more difficult when a disciple is very intellectual. By and by, </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">Ouspensky started thinking that he knew all. That is the deception that </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">intelligentsia creates easily. He was such an intellectual man that he formulated </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">everything and he started feeling that he knew. Then, by and by, the rift started. </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">Gurdjieff was always demanding absurd things. For example, Ouspensky was </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">thousands of miles away and Gurdjieff sent him a telegram:'Come immediately, </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">leave everything.' Ouspensky was in financial, family trouble, and many things, </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">and it was almost impossible for him to leave immediately, but he left. He sold </div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">everything, he dropped the family and he immediately ran. When he arrived, the </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">first thing Gurdjieff said was, 'Now you can go back.' This was the thing that </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">started the rift. Ouspensky left and never came back -- but he missed. That was </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">just a test for the total surrender. </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">When you are totally surrendered, you don't ask, 'Why?' The Master says, </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">'Come,' you come; the Master says, 'Go,' you go. Had Ouspensky gone that day </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">as simply as he had come, something deep inside him which was frustrating his </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">whole growth would have dropped. But it was too absurd for a man like </div>
<div id="ts_120" class="t s1_120">Ouspensky that Gurdjieff ask suddenly, and that he come. He must have come </div>
<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">with many expectations because he was thinking that he had sacrificed so much: </div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">the family, the problems, the finances, the service -- he had dropped everything. </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">He must have been thinking that he was a martyr. He had come and without </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">even greeting him, the first thing that Gurdjieff said, looking at him, was, 'Now </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">you can go back.' It was too much; he dropped out. </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">By the dropping out of Ouspensky, the whole effort to create a psychology of the </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">third dimension stopped. Gurdjieff tried and tried; he tried to find somebody </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">else. With many people he worked, but he could not find one of the calibre of </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">Ouspensky. Ouspensky's growth stopped, and Gurdjieff's work for the third </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">psychology stopped. Together they were wonderful; separate, both became </div>
<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">crippled. Ouspensky remained intellectual, Gurdjieff remained a mystic. That </div>
<div id="t14_120" class="t s1_120">was the trouble. That was why it could not happen. </div>
<div id="t15_120" class="t s1_120">I am again trying to work in the third dimension, and I have not taken the risk </div>
<div id="t16_120" class="t s1_120">that Gurdjieff took. I am not depending on anybody; I am Gurdjieff plus </div>
<div id="t17_120" class="t s1_120">Ouspensky. It is hard work to live in two different dimensions, it is very hard. </div>
