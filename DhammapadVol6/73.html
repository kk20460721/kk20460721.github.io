<div id="t1_73" class="t s1_73">and closer -- it was death coming closer. They would kill him! But he was going as fast </div>
<div id="t2_73" class="t s1_73">as he could on his horse. Tired he was, tired was his horse; wounded he was, wounded </div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s1_73">was his horse. </div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s1_73">And then suddenly he came to a cul-de-sac. The way ended; there was an abyss. And </div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s1_73">there was no possibility of turning back because the enemy was closing in, at every </div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s1_73">moment coming closer. He could not take the jump into the abyss; that was sure death. </div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s1_73">Except for waiting there was nothing to do. </div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s1_73">Suddenly he remembered the ring. He opened the ring, removed the diamond. Inside </div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s1_73">there was a piece of paper; on the piece of paper just a simple, single sentence: "This too </div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s1_73">will pass away." And suddenly a great calmness descended on him: "This too will pass </div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s1_73">away." </div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s1_73">And it happened exactly like that. He was hearing those noises coming closer; by and </div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s1_73">by he started hearing them going farther away. They had taken a wrong turn. He had </div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s1_73">passed a crossroad, they must have moved on some other road. Then he gathered his </div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s1_73">armies, fought the enemies again, won back his kingdom. He was received with great </div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s1_73">joy, garlanded, flowers showered, the whole capitol decorated for his welcome. </div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s1_73">Suddenly he felt great ego arising in him. Again he remembered the message, "This too </div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s1_73">will pass away," and the ego disappeared. And all those garlands and all that welcome </div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s1_73">became just a child's play. In failure it helped, in success it helped. </div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s1_73">That became his meditation, that became his mantra. So whatsoever would come he </div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s1_73">would repeat deep down -- not verbally, but the feeling would be there in his heart -- </div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s1_73">"This too will pass away." </div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s1_73">If you can remember it, then whatsoever comes into your mind you remain simply a </div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s1_73">witness: "This too will pass away." That witnessing is awareness -- but we are identified. </div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s1_73">We become greed, we become anger, we become lust. Whatsoever comes in front of our </div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s1_73">consciousness, we become identified with it. It is as foolish as when it happens to very </div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s1_73">small children. </div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s1_73">Have you tried it? Just put a mirror before a very small child. He will look in the mirror </div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s1_73">very surprised, with wide open eyes he will look: "Who is this fellow?" He will try to </div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s1_73">catch hold, but he cannot catch hold of the person. And then, if the child is intelligent, </div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s1_73">he will try to go to the back of the mirror: "Maybe the child is hiding behind the mirror." </div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s1_73">He is not yet aware that it is only a mirror; there is no reality. </div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s1_73">Mind is only a mirror: it reflects the clouds of the world, it reflects all that happens </div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s1_73">around in the world. Somebody insults and there is anger -- it is a reflection. Somebody </div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s1_73">beautiful passes by and it reflects -- it is lust. And you immediately become identified </div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s1_73">with it. </div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s1_73">Keep a little distance... and slowly slowly, you will find that the distance goes on </div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s1_73">growing. One day the mind is so far far away, it does not affect you at all. </div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s1_73">This is coming home, this is buddhahood. AES DHAMMO SANANTANO: this is the </div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s1_73">inexhaustible law of life. If you can be a witness you will be able to pass through a great </div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s1_73">transformation: you will know your real self. </div>
