<div id="t1_104" class="t s1_104">When Columbus reached America, discovered America and came back, people started </div>
<div id="t2_104" class="t s1_104">saying, "This is not such a great thing. Don't make such a fuss about it. The earth is </div>
<div id="t3_104" class="t s1_104">round. Anybody could have reached there!" </div>
<div id="t4_104" class="t s1_104">The queen of Spain invited Columbus for a dinner; the whole court was invited. And </div>
<div id="t5_104" class="t s1_104">everybody was jealous of Columbus, so they were saying, "This is not something big </div>
<div id="t6_104" class="t s1_104">that the earth is round." </div>
<div id="t7_104" class="t s1_104">Columbus said, "But just three years ago when I was saying the earth is round, nobody </div>
<div id="t8_104" class="t s1_104">was ready to listen to me. In fact, I was surprised when the queen agreed to help me." </div>
<div id="t9_104" class="t s1_104">It has happened many times: when the man has not been able to understand something </div>
<div id="ta_104" class="t s1_104">of the unknown, the woman has been able to understand. Man goes with a slow, logical </div>
<div id="tb_104" class="t s1_104">process towards a conclusion. Woman is intuitive: she does not go by a slow process, </div>
<div id="tc_104" class="t s1_104">she simply jumps to the conclusion. That's why it is so difficult to talk with a woman, to </div>
<div id="td_104" class="t s1_104">argue with a woman. Man always finds himself at a loss, because he goes with very </div>
<div id="te_104" class="t s1_104">skillful logic, prepares the whole ground and the process step by step. He "logics" to the </div>
<div id="tf_104" class="t s1_104">conclusion, and the woman suddenly jumps with no premise, with no process -- she </div>
<div id="tg_104" class="t s1_104">simply arrives at the conclusion. They live in totally different worlds. </div>
<div id="th_104" class="t s1_104">The queen of Spain agreed. She said, "Okay, go ahead, and I will bear the expenses." </div>
<div id="ti_104" class="t s1_104">Everybody had laughed at the foolish queen, and people had said, "A woman is after all </div>
<div id="tj_104" class="t s1_104">a woman -- mad, crazy! What does she understand about geography, astronomy? This </div>
<div id="tk_104" class="t s1_104">man has befooled the queen." </div>
<div id="tl_104" class="t s1_104">Now everybody was saying that it was so easy. Columbus did one thing: he took one </div>
<div id="tm_104" class="t s1_104">egg from the plate and told the people of the court, "Can anyone make it stand upright </div>
<div id="tn_104" class="t s1_104">on the table?" </div>
<div id="to_104" class="t s1_104">Everybody tried, but it would fall down; it would not stand upright. They said, "This is </div>
<div id="tp_104" class="t s1_104">impossible. This can't be done. How can you make the egg stand? It is so round shaped, </div>
<div id="tq_104" class="t s1_104">it is bound to fall down." </div>
<div id="tr_104" class="t s1_104">When everybody had tried and agreed that this was impossible, Columbus took the egg </div>
<div id="ts_104" class="t s1_104">in his hand, hit it hard on the table so the bottom became flat, and the egg was standing. </div>
<div id="tt_104" class="t s1_104">They all said, "This is cheating! Why didn't you say so before? We could have done it!" </div>
<div id="tu_104" class="t s1_104">Columbus said, "It is always easy when a thing has been done. I have not prevented </div>
<div id="tv_104" class="t s1_104">you, I have not said you can't do it, but none of you ever imagined doing it. Now it is </div>
<div id="tw_104" class="t s1_104">simple, now everybody can do it, now it is nothing much." </div>
<div id="tx_104" class="t s1_104">When you become a buddha you will be surprised how simple the whole phenomenon </div>
<div id="ty_104" class="t s1_104">is. You will be puzzled... why did it not happen before, why did it take so long, so many </div>
<div id="tz_104" class="t s1_104">lives? In India they say millions of lives, and they are right. "Why did it take millions of </div>
<div id="t10_104" class="t s1_104">lives? And the process was so simple!" One simply laughs at human stupidity and </div>
<div id="t11_104" class="t s1_104">ridiculousness. </div>
<div id="t12_104" class="t s1_104">And yes, buddhas are bound to say things which can be dangerous to those who are not </div>
<div id="t13_104" class="t s1_104">yet awakened. </div>
<div id="t14_104" class="t s1_104">For example, YOU listening to this -- that Buddha could have become enlightened </div>
<div id="t15_104" class="t s1_104">anywhere -- you may find a rationalization to go away from here. That will be a trick of </div>
<div id="t16_104" class="t s1_104">your mind. And I am not saying that you cannot become a buddha -- you can become a </div>
