<div id="t1_65" class="t s1_65">man said that, "I have been in the ashram for fifteen days," I looked into the article. I </div>
<div id="t2_65" class="t s1_65">was amazed! </div>
<div id="t3_65" class="t s1_65">He says that the ashram is spread over fifteen square miles! Now, I think even Poona is </div>
<div id="t4_65" class="t s1_65">not spread over fifteen square miles. He says the moment you enter the gate the first </div>
<div id="t5_65" class="t s1_65">thing that you see is a big white marble statue of a naked woman! Because I very rarely </div>
<div id="t6_65" class="t s1_65">go to the gate, I asked Laxmi, "What has happened? Where is this statue?" </div>
<div id="t7_65" class="t s1_65">He says that there are artificial lakes, artificial waterfalls, thousands of sannyasins swim </div>
<div id="t8_65" class="t s1_65">naked in the lake. There are underground air-conditioned halls where ten thousand </div>
<div id="t9_65" class="t s1_65">people can sit together. Each morning I deliver a discourse in an underground hall. You </div>
<div id="ta_65" class="t s1_65">are sitting in an underground hall, air-conditioned, and not only that -- all the disciples </div>
<div id="tb_65" class="t s1_65">have to sit in absolute nudity! Feel your clothes -- if you think you are wearing clothes </div>
<div id="tc_65" class="t s1_65">you are deceived. You are all naked. </div>
<div id="td_65" class="t s1_65">Now these people have a great investment in creating rumors. That's how the </div>
<div id="te_65" class="t s1_65">magazines, the newspapers sell. They have nothing to do with truth. This man has </div>
<div id="tf_65" class="t s1_65">never been here. </div>
<div id="tg_65" class="t s1_65">They cannot understand for two reasons. First: if they understand, they will not be able </div>
<div id="th_65" class="t s1_65">to write anything. That has happened to a few journalists. Those who have understood, </div>
<div id="ti_65" class="t s1_65">they have become sannyasins; they have forgotten all about writing. They had come to </div>
<div id="tj_65" class="t s1_65">write; now they have decided not to go again back, they have decided to be here. </div>
<div id="tk_65" class="t s1_65">Not only journalists... here are detectives from many countries. And a few detectives </div>
<div id="tl_65" class="t s1_65">even have become sannyasins! And they have confessed to me that they had come as </div>
<div id="tm_65" class="t s1_65">spies, but now they have understood what is happening here and they would like to </div>
<div id="tn_65" class="t s1_65">become part of the commune. </div>
<div id="to_65" class="t s1_65">If a journalist goes and reports exactly what he has seen, nobody is going to believe </div>
<div id="tp_65" class="t s1_65">him. That's what happened with Satyananda. He had come from a famous German </div>
<div id="tq_65" class="t s1_65">magazine, STERN, to report; then he became a sannyasin. His becoming a sannyasin </div>
<div id="tr_65" class="t s1_65">created a trouble. His own people with whom he had worked for years -- the chief </div>
<div id="ts_65" class="t s1_65">editor, the editors and others -- they thought that he had been hypnotized. He tried </div>
<div id="tt_65" class="t s1_65">hard for months to convince them that he had not been hypnotized, but they wouldn't </div>
<div id="tu_65" class="t s1_65">listen. They were not even ready to publish what he had written. They said, "You are </div>
<div id="tv_65" class="t s1_65">too much influenced, you are not in your senses." And even when they agreed after </div>
<div id="tw_65" class="t s1_65">months of argument to publish it, they cut the whole article into half in such a way that </div>
<div id="tx_65" class="t s1_65">it lost all context, it lost all its wholeness, it became fragmentary. </div>
<div id="ty_65" class="t s1_65">In the first place, the journalist lives on rumors. He is not here to understand me, he is </div>
<div id="tz_65" class="t s1_65">here to MISunderstand me; that is his investment. Secondly: the people who become </div>
<div id="t10_65" class="t s1_65">journalists -- not all the people but almost ninety-nine point nine percent of the people </div>
<div id="t11_65" class="t s1_65">who become journalists -- are very uncreative people. In fact those who can create, they </div>
<div id="t12_65" class="t s1_65">create; those who cannot create, they criticize. Uncreative people become great critics. </div>
<div id="t13_65" class="t s1_65">It is easy to criticize poetry, it is difficult to write poetry. It is very easy to criticize </div>
<div id="t14_65" class="t s1_65">painting -- you can criticize Picasso, but you cannot paint like Picasso. It is easy to </div>
<div id="t15_65" class="t s1_65">criticize anything. </div>
