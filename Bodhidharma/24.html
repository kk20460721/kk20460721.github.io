<div id="t3_24" class="t s1_24">Bodhidharma's statement is, BUDDHAS DON'T SAVE BUDDHAS. He is saying </div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s1_24">you are all buddhas whether you know it or not, and how can anybody save </div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s1_24">you? How can one buddha save another buddha? All that a buddha can do is to </div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s1_24">wake you up. That is not much of a saving. When you wake somebody up, do </div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s1_24">you think you are holier, and special, and you have done a great service to </div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s1_24">humanity, by waking a poor fellow who was sleeping? </div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s1_24">BUDDHAS DON'T SAVE BUDDHAS. This is a very pregnant statement. It gives </div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s1_24">equality to every being. The only difference, which is not much of a difference, is </div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s1_24">...everybody is a buddha; a few are asleep and are unaware of who they are, and </div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s1_24">a few have become awakened and know who they are. But essentially, there is no </div>
<div id="td_24" class="t s1_24">difference at all, and there is no question of saving anybody. It is his right if </div>
<div id="te_24" class="t s1_24">somebody wants to continue to sleep; it is his birthright. You cannot forcibly </div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s1_24">wake up somebody because that is interfering with his freedom. </div>
<div id="tg_24" class="t s1_24">It happened: I was sitting on the banks of the Ganges in Allahabad. I had gone to </div>
<div id="th_24" class="t s1_24">speak in a Christian college in Allahabad, and the Christian college is just on the </div>
<div id="ti_24" class="t s1_24">bank of the Ganges on a very beautiful spot just near the railway bridge. I was </div>
<div id="tj_24" class="t s1_24">sitting on the bank, and there was nobody for miles and suddenly a man came </div>
<div id="tk_24" class="t s1_24">and jumped. I thought perhaps he was taking a bath, and as he jumped, he </div>
<div id="tl_24" class="t s1_24">started shouting, "Help me, help me." He was just close to me. </div>
<div id="tm_24" class="t s1_24">For a moment I thought, "What is the matter? If he wanted to be helped, why has </div>
<div id="tn_24" class="t s1_24">he jumped?" But I thought it is better to first bring him out. If I start thinking </div>
<div id="to_24" class="t s1_24">about it, by that time he will be finished. So I jumped. He was a heavy man but I </div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s1_24">pulled him out somehow, and I felt a certain resistance. It became even more </div>
<div id="tq_24" class="t s1_24">puzzling, he was shouting, "Save me, I am drowning." But when I was trying to </div>
<div id="tr_24" class="t s1_24">bring him out, I felt that he was not being helpful, he was resisting my effort. </div>
<div id="ts_24" class="t s1_24">I said, "You seem to be mad. Do you want to be saved or not?" </div>
<div id="tt_24" class="t s1_24">He said, "Please save me." So I pulled him out. And when he was out, he started </div>
<div id="tu_24" class="t s1_24">becoming very angry at me saying, "Can't you understand? I was committing </div>
<div id="tv_24" class="t s1_24">suicide." </div>
<div id="tw_24" class="t s1_24">I said, "You should have said so before. So why were you shouting, `Save me'?" </div>
<div id="tx_24" class="t s1_24">He said, "It is natural. I wanted to commit suicide but deep down somewhere </div>
<div id="ty_24" class="t s1_24">there was still a desire to live. That's why I started shouting." </div>
<div id="tz_24" class="t s1_24">I said, "Okay." I simply pushed him back. I said, "If this is the case, then I will not </div>
<div id="t10_24" class="t s1_24">do anything against you." </div>
<div id="t11_24" class="t s1_24">He started shouting again, "Are you mad or what? Do you want to kill me?" </div>
<div id="t12_24" class="t s1_24">I said, "Now I have nothing to do with you. Whatever I have done, I have </div>
<div id="t13_24" class="t s1_24">undone it. Now I will sit silently here and watch." </div>
<div id="t14_24" class="t s1_24">Somebody else came by and jumped in and took him out. This time he did not </div>
<div id="t15_24" class="t s1_24">give any resistance but he went on looking at me. I said, "What is the matter, </div>
<div id="t16_24" class="t s1_24">where are you going?" </div>
<div id="t17_24" class="t s1_24">He said, "Is it compulsory to commit suicide?" </div>
