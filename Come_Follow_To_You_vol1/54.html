<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">with me. Once I am gone the meditation is going to be organized -- it is </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">impossible to prevent it; it is the way things move. Then you will do it for twenty </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">years -- or two hundred years -- and nothing will happen. It does not happen </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">through the technique; technique is just dead. It happens through the love that </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">you feel for me, that I have for you. The technique is just an excuse. It is not the </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">most important thing; the most important thing is your love, your trust. In that </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">trust, the technique works and functions, becomes alive, gets roots into your </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">heart. </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">Sooner or later everything becomes organized: prayer, meditation, everything. </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">Then the glory is lost. Then you can go on doing it -- you may become absolutely </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">perfect, skilled; it may also give some sort of consolation -- but the mutation will </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">be missing. You will remain the same, a continuity. It will not be a baptism: you </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">will not die in it, and you will not be reborn. </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">That's why my insistence is on searching for an alive Master. Scriptures are there, </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">once those rivers were flowing, but now they are frozen. They are lost in the </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">desert land of churches, temples and organizations. The poetry no longer throbs </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">in them: they are dead dogmas, arguments; the love has disappeared. </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">Remember this always: if you can find a living Master, forget all about scriptures. </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">The living Master is the only scripture which is alive. Read his heart and allow </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">your heart to be read by him. Be in a communion -- that is the only way. </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">Jesus worked the same way as you feel I am working, but twenty centuries have </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">passed. The first disciples who came around him staked their lives: they left all </div>

<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">This man was a treasure of the unknown world. Nothing was too much. </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">Whatsoever was asked they did. And they had the opportunity to walk with a </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">god on this earth, to be in close affinity with divinity. </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">Others were saying, "This man is wrong," but those who were close to him knew </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">that only this man is right -- and if this man is not right, then NOTHING can be </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">right, then 'right' cannot exist. They crucified this man, but those who were close </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">knew that you cannot crucify him. This man had already entered immortality, </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">this man had already become part of their immortal souls. You can kill the body, </div>

<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">They had lived, walked, breathed, into the being of this man. They were </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">transformed. It is not a question of technique. They prayed with this man but the </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">real thing was not prayer, the real thing was just to be in the presence of this </div>
