<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">CHAPTER 5. GOD IS YOUR INSECURITY</div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s2_124">BECAME MORE CIVILIZED, THEY BEGAN TO CONCEPTUALIZE GOD AS A SEPARATE</div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s2_124">INDIVIDUAL. WHY IS THIS?</div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s2_124">Primitive societies had no private property.</div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s2_124">Primitive societies had no families, they were tribal.</div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s2_124">Nobody knew who was the father, people only knew about uncles and the mother. Primitive societies</div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s2_124">were matriarchal; the mother was the only person they knew, the father had not yet arrived.</div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s2_124">As societies started moving from hunting to cultivation, they stopped being gypsies; otherwise they</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s2_124">were continuously moving wherever there was the possibility of ﬁnding more animals to hunt. They</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s2_124">could not remain in one place, because soon the food was ﬁnished. And as animals were moving</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s2_124">away from them, they had to follow the animals. Their whole concern was how to get food.</div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s2_124">There were no houses, there were no cities, there were only temporary camps. Private property had</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s2_124">not yet arisen. With cultivation, private property came into being. The people who were stronger</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s2_124">managed to get as much land as they wanted. The people who were weaker managed to live at the</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s2_124">very minimum – whatever was left over from the stronger gangsters.</div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s2_124">Those strong criminals became ﬁnally your kings, and your lords, and your counts.</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s2_124">These are</div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s2_124">basically criminal people, who have deprived humanity of much of their joys, forced them into a</div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s2_124">corner. But once private property arose, the father had to be certain that his son was his son. With</div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s2_124">private property the family came into being. And with private property the woman was transformed</div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s2_124">into a subhuman species. She became imprisoned. Now she was nothing but property, the property</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s2_124">of a certain man. And her whole function was to be a factory to reproduce children.</div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s2_124">Tribal people have no idea of a father, but the tribal people and the primitive knew many things that</div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s2_124">we have forgotten: they felt life surging in the trees; they felt life moving in the rivers; they felt life in</div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s2_124">the tidal waves of the ocean, shattering continuously, eternally on the seashore. They were more</div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s2_124">sensitive people. They were illiterate, uncivilized, but they were more sensitive and more receptive.</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s2_124">I have heard about the native Australians. Most of them have been killed by the white man, and killed</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s2_124">in such an ugly way that the white man seems to be the most barbarious man on the earth. The</div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s2_124">native Australians were killed almost like animals. People used to go hunting the natives, because</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s2_124">they thought them to be not human beings, but a far lower species. So almost ninety percent of the</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s2_124">natives of Australia have been killed, and eaten, by the white people, because it was hunting. Just</div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s2_124">as you hunt tigers and lions and deer, you were hunting a different species from humanity. They</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s2_124">were not white, their faces were different, their behavior was different.</div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s2_124">But I have heard about the natives of Australia – and a few scientists are still working on the project</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s2_124">– that they had a very strange way. They had no post ofﬁce, they had no telephone system, they</div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s2_124">had no wireless. They used to hypnotize a tree, a particular tree which is more hypnotizable. Their</div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s2_124">sensitivity must have found the right kind of tree that is ready to be hypnotized.</div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s2_124">In humanity thirty-three percent of people are immediately capable of being hypnotized, only thirty-</div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s2_124">three percent.</div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s2_124">But strangely enough, only thirty-three percent of people are intelligent; they are</div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s2_124">the same people. Only thirty-three percent of people are creative; they are the same people. The</div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s2_124">remaining ones are insensitive, unreceptive, unintelligent.</div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s2_124">God is Dead, Now Zen is the Only Living Truth 124</div>
<div id="t18_124" class="t s3_124">Osho</div>
