<div id="t1_55" class="t s1_55">The queen was very much worried. She saw that there were going to be hundreds of </div>
<div id="t2_55" class="t s1_55">people unnecessarily murdered. But sooner or later almost everybody was drunk with </div>
<div id="t3_55" class="t s1_55">his music. </div>
<div id="t4_55" class="t s1_55">When he finished in the middle of the night, the people who had to report, they </div>
<div id="t5_55" class="t s1_55">reported that "Not a single soul has remained without swaying, and we are sorry to say </div>
<div id="t6_55" class="t s1_55">that we are also on the list!" </div>
<div id="t7_55" class="t s1_55">The king said, "Now, Master, what do you want? -- all these people butchered, </div>
<div id="t8_55" class="t s1_55">murdered? I am also on the list, my wife is also on the list, my whole court is on the </div>
<div id="t9_55" class="t s1_55">list!" </div>
<div id="ta_55" class="t s1_55">The master laughed and he said, "I was waiting for these people. These are the right </div>
<div id="tb_55" class="t s1_55">people for whom I can play. Forget all about the condition! It was just a strategy to </div>
<div id="tc_55" class="t s1_55">prevent those who were not ready to risk their lives, it was to prevent the cowards. </div>
<div id="td_55" class="t s1_55">These are the people for whom I will play. And not only today -- I am going to stay in </div>
<div id="te_55" class="t s1_55">this town for months together because these are MY people. They have forgotten about </div>
<div id="tf_55" class="t s1_55">their lives, or even if they had remembered they could not resist. The joy was so </div>
<div id="tg_55" class="t s1_55">tremendous that they were ready to go, even with the risk; they were perfectly aware. </div>
<div id="th_55" class="t s1_55">These are the people for whom I exist because these are the people who can be turned </div>
<div id="ti_55" class="t s1_55">inwards. They were fully aware and yet drunk." </div>
<div id="tj_55" class="t s1_55">And that is the whole secret of meditation. The paradox disappears -- the paradox </div>
<div id="tk_55" class="t s1_55">between drunkenness and awareness. And its first experience can happen in music </div>
<div id="tl_55" class="t s1_55">more easily than in any other place, than in anything else. Music, dance... all these are </div>
<div id="tm_55" class="t s1_55">devices, discovered by great awakened masters. They have fallen into wrong hands. </div>
<div id="tn_55" class="t s1_55">To be a teacher of music is one thing -- he can teach you the technique. I am not a </div>
<div id="to_55" class="t s1_55">teacher of music -- I cannot teach you the technique -- but I can help you to listen to the </div>
<div id="tp_55" class="t s1_55">inner music, and that is real music. </div>
<div id="tq_55" class="t s1_55">In China they have the saying: "When the musician becomes perfect he throws away his </div>
<div id="tr_55" class="t s1_55">instruments" -- because they are no more needed. He can close his eyes, he can turn </div>
<div id="ts_55" class="t s1_55">himself inwards and he can listen to the music that is already there and always there. </div>
<div id="tt_55" class="t s1_55">And when the archer becomes perfect he throws away his bow and his arrows; there is </div>
<div id="tu_55" class="t s1_55">no need for them. </div>
<div id="tv_55" class="t s1_55">Whenever any art is perfect it ends in meditation -- it HAS to end in meditation. If it is </div>
<div id="tw_55" class="t s1_55">not leading you towards meditation then something has gone wrong. </div>
<div id="tx_55" class="t s1_55">That's why much of the modern art is not art, it is insanity. Much modern music is not </div>
<div id="ty_55" class="t s1_55">music; it simply makes you sexually excited. It is just the opposite of real music. Real </div>
<div id="tz_55" class="t s1_55">music helps you to transcend your biology, your physiology, your psychology. Real </div>
<div id="t10_55" class="t s1_55">music takes you to the world of the beyond -- what Buddha calls the farther shore, even </div>
<div id="t11_55" class="t s1_55">beyond the beyond. </div>
<div id="t12_55" class="t s1_55">Gurdjieff used to call real art "objective art." Modern art is not, in that sense, objective </div>
<div id="t13_55" class="t s1_55">art. In the past the awakened masters have used all kinds of devices: painting, </div>
<div id="t14_55" class="t s1_55">sculpture, music, dance, drama. Every kind of device has been used to help you, </div>
<div id="t15_55" class="t s1_55">because there are different types of people who can be helped in different ways: </div>
<div id="t16_55" class="t s1_55">somebody through music, somebody through painting, somebody through poetry. </div>
