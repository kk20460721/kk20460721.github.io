<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">wrong path; meditation to him was a wrong thing. He was desiring that his son become </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">a great emperor; that was his deep ambition. Buddha was his only son, and one day </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">Buddha escaped. I have every suspicion that the reason for his escape must have been </div>

<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">born his mother is bound to die. That's how people create stupid stories. There have </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">been many buddhas. Mahavira's mother did not die, but if you ask the Buddhists they </div>
