<div id="t1_282" class="t s1_282">the mysteries of life and existence become available to you. Once this truth is recognized,</div>
<div id="t2_282" class="t s1_282">known, you can use the mind -- just as a vehicle trained to express in a fragmentary way.</div>
<div id="t3_282" class="t s1_282">Something can be expressed; although those words are not absolutely correct -- they cannot</div>
<div id="t4_282" class="t s1_282">be, they were not made for it -- they can indicate. At least they can give you a few hints.</div>
<div id="t5_282" class="t s1_282">There have been two types of saints, sages: one, I have told you -- is the arhatas -- who</div>
<div id="t6_282" class="t s1_282">remain silent; it takes sensitive people to find them. And bodhisattvas -- they make every</div>
<div id="t7_282" class="t s1_282">effort to reach out to the sensitive people. There is no way to say who is doing better; they are</div>
<div id="t8_282" class="t s1_282">simply following their own inner light. Nobody is higher than the other.</div>
<div id="t9_282" class="t s1_282">The world is so strange: sometimes if truth comes to your door and knocks, his very</div>
<div id="ta_282" class="t s1_282">coming to your door may become a barrier. The reverse is also true: when you go on the</div>
<div id="tb_282" class="t s1_282">search and you knock on the door of truth and everything remains silent ... perhaps you may</div>
<div id="tc_282" class="t s1_282">be more receptive to the silent one, to his presence, than to the bodhisattva who runs after you,</div>
<div id="td_282" class="t s1_282">who tries every effort to approach as many people as possible. But both have helped in their</div>
<div id="te_282" class="t s1_282">own unique ways.</div>
<div id="tf_282" class="t s1_282">You have the capacity, you are just not aware of it.</div>
<div id="tg_282" class="t s1_282">The most costly and most famous diamond in the world is the Kohinoor -- the word</div>
<div id="th_282" class="t s1_282">'kohinoor' means the light of the world -- which was presented to the British king of that time</div>
<div id="ti_282" class="t s1_282">by a Sikh king of the Punjab, Ranjit Singh, just as a friendly gesture. It is still in the crown of</div>
<div id="tj_282" class="t s1_282">the British queen, but it is such a unique piece that it is not used, it is being kept in a museum</div>
<div id="tk_282" class="t s1_282">for people to see.</div>
<div id="tl_282" class="t s1_282">This Kohinoor has a tremendous story behind it. It was found in the state of Hyderabad, in</div>
<div id="tm_282" class="t s1_282">a small village called Golconda. A poor man had a small field by the side of a small river in</div>
<div id="tn_282" class="t s1_282">Golconda. One day he found this Kohinoor: it was three times bigger than it is now, because</div>
<div id="to_282" class="t s1_282">so much cutting and polishing has gone on that only one-third has remained, two-thirds have</div>
<div id="tp_282" class="t s1_282">been removed. It was shining in the sand of the river, and he thought it would be good for the</div>
<div id="tq_282" class="t s1_282">children to play with -- so he brought home the Kohinoor and his children were playing with</div>
<div id="tr_282" class="t s1_282">it.</div>
<div id="ts_282" class="t s1_282">Just by coincidence a wandering sannyasin reached Golconda and asked this poor man for</div>
<div id="tt_282" class="t s1_282">shelter for the night. The poor man was immensely happy: although he was to give him his</div>
<div id="tu_282" class="t s1_282">own food and he himself would have to remain hungry, it is a great blessing that a man who</div>
<div id="tv_282" class="t s1_282">has left everything in the search for truth has knocked on his door.</div>
<div id="tw_282" class="t s1_282">When the sannyasin had eaten the food and before going to sleep, they started talking. The</div>
<div id="tx_282" class="t s1_282">wandering sannyasin was a source of great information because he was wandering from one</div>
<div id="ty_282" class="t s1_282">corner of the country to the other. He said to the poor man, "Looking at your things, your</div>
<div id="tz_282" class="t s1_282">small hut, your torn clothes, I feel sad. I know places ... if you sell your land and your house</div>
<div id="t10_282" class="t s1_282">here, for the same price you can find at least four times more land. Then your life will be</div>
<div id="t11_282" class="t s1_282">richer."</div>
<div id="t12_282" class="t s1_282">So the man sold everything, but the children carried their toy, the Kohinoor. And on the</div>
<div id="t13_282" class="t s1_282">way some jewelers saw those children carrying such a big diamond that their breath stopped.</div>
<div id="t14_282" class="t s1_282">They could not believe, they had never conceived that such a big diamond could exist.</div>
<div id="t15_282" class="t s1_282">The jewelers asked him the price, and he said, "There is no question of price -- it is just a</div>
<div id="t16_282" class="t s1_282">toy for my children. You can give whatever you feel like giving and take it." But the children</div>
<div id="t17_282" class="t s1_282">were reluctant, they wouldn't give it up. So finally the poor man said, "We don't have anything</div>
<div id="t18_282" class="t s1_282">else, just that children's toy. Don't disturb them" -- and he moved on.</div>
<div id="t19_282" class="t s1_282">Chapter 23 - So very close</div>
<div id="t1a_282" class="t s1_282">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
