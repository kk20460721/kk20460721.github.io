<div id="t1_126" class="t s1_126">CHAPTER 19.</div>
<div id="t2_126" class="t s2_126">come across. I have seen many cunning men, but nobody to compare with my Baba. I always used</div>
<div id="t3_126" class="t s2_126">to wonder where my father got his simplicity from. Perhaps it is nature that does not allow things to</div>
<div id="t4_126" class="t s2_126">become out of balance, so it gives a very simple child to a very complex man.</div>
<div id="t5_126" class="t s2_126">Baba was a genius in cunningness. The whole village would tremble. Nobody was able to conceive</div>
<div id="t6_126" class="t s2_126">what his plans were. In fact, he was such a man – and I have observed it myself – that we would be</div>
<div id="t7_126" class="t s2_126">going to the river, my Baba and me, and somebody would ask, ”Where are you going, Baba?” The</div>
<div id="t8_126" class="t s2_126">whole town used to call him Baba; it just means grandfather. We were going to the river, and it was</div>
<div id="t9_126" class="t s2_126">clear to everybody where we were going, but this man, with his quality would say, ”To the station.” I</div>
<div id="ta_126" class="t s2_126">would look at him, and he would look at me and wink.</div>
<div id="tb_126" class="t s2_126">I was puzzled. What was the point? No business was being done, and you are not supposed to</div>
<div id="tc_126" class="t s2_126">lie just for no reason at all. When the man had passed by, I asked him, ”Why did you wink, Baba?</div>
<div id="td_126" class="t s2_126">And why did you lie to that man without any reason? Why could you not say ‘to the river,’ when we</div>
<div id="te_126" class="t s2_126">are going to the river? He knows, everybody knows, that this road leads to the river and not to the</div>
<div id="tf_126" class="t s2_126">station. You know it and still you said, ‘to the station.’”</div>
<div id="tg_126" class="t s2_126">He said, ”You don’t understand, one has to practice continuously.”</div>
<div id="th_126" class="t s2_126">”Practice what?” I asked him.</div>
<div id="ti_126" class="t s2_126">He said, ”One has to continuously practice one’s business. I cannot just tell the simple truth because</div>
<div id="tj_126" class="t s2_126">then, one day, doing business, I may simply say the right price. And it is none of your business at</div>
<div id="tk_126" class="t s2_126">all; that’s why I winked at you, so you would keep quiet. As far as I am concerned, we are going</div>
<div id="tl_126" class="t s2_126">to the station; whether this road leads there or not is nobody else’s business. Even if that man had</div>
<div id="tm_126" class="t s2_126">said that this road does not lead to the station, I would have just said I am going to the station via</div>
<div id="tn_126" class="t s2_126">the river. It is up to me. One can go anywhere from anywhere. It may take a little longer, that’s all.”</div>
<div id="to_126" class="t s2_126">Baba was that kind of man.</div>
<div id="tp_126" class="t s2_126">He lived there with all his children, my father and his brothers and</div>
<div id="tq_126" class="t s2_126">sisters, and their husbands... and one could not know all the people who had gathered there. I saw</div>
<div id="tr_126" class="t s2_126">people coming and never leaving. We were not rich, yet there was enough to eat for everybody.</div>
<div id="ts_126" class="t s2_126">I did not want to enter this family, and I told my mother, ”Either I will go back to the village alone –</div>
<div id="tt_126" class="t s2_126">the bullock cart is ready, and I know the way; I will get there somehow. And I know the villagers, they</div>
<div id="tu_126" class="t s2_126">will help support a child. And it is only a question of a few years, then I will repay them as much as I</div>
<div id="tv_126" class="t s2_126">can. But I cannot live in this family. This is not a family, it’s a bazaar.”</div>
<div id="tw_126" class="t s2_126">And it was a bazaar, continuously buzzing with so many people, no space at all, no silence. Even if</div>
<div id="tx_126" class="t s2_126">an elephant had jumped into that ancient pond, nobody would have heard the plop; there was too</div>
<div id="ty_126" class="t s2_126">much going on. I simply refused, saying, ”If I have to stay then the only alternative is for me to live</div>
<div id="tz_126" class="t s2_126">with my Nani.”</div>
<div id="t10_126" class="t s2_126">My mother was, of course, hurt. I am sorry, because since then I have been hurting her again and</div>
<div id="t11_126" class="t s2_126">again. I could not help it. In fact I was not responsible; the situation was such that I could not live</div>
<div id="t12_126" class="t s2_126">in that family after so many years of absolute freedom, silence, space. In fact, in my Nana’s house</div>
<div id="t13_126" class="t s2_126">I was the only one who was ever heard. My Nana was mostly silently chanting his mantra, and of</div>
<div id="t14_126" class="t s2_126">course my grandmother had no one else to talk to.</div>
<div id="t15_126" class="t s2_126">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t16_126" class="t s2_126">126</div>
