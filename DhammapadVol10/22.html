<div id="t2_22" class="t s1_22">sun rising on the horizon. It was so clearly there that to deny it would be a sin, and the </div>
<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">priest was afraid. </div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">The man came very close to the door, just near the steps, stood there, laughed loudly, </div>
<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">turned back and went home. The priest was very much puzzled why he did this. He ran </div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">after him, got hold of him and said, "Why did you do this? Don't you want to come in </div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">the church?" </div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">He said, "No, I don't want to come in the church. I had just come to see you and the </div>

<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">was there I asked him, 'Can I enter into the church? Am I pure enough now?' God said, </div>

<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">you? You drop the whole idea. I have dropped it myself!'" </div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">Your churches, your temples are empty. They are graves of religion. Religion no more </div>

<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">there is a great flowering, but not in a Buddhist temple, not in a Christian church. </div>

<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">has been happening consistently. No religion has anything to do with the original </div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">source. In fact, Christians are more destructive to Christ's message than anybody else, </div>
<div id="tq_22" class="t s1_22">and the priests are the leaders of the Christians. They don't have any relationship with </div>
<div id="tr_22" class="t s1_22">Christ -- they can't have. They are afraid of Christ. They must be afraid deep down that </div>

<div id="t10_22" class="t s1_22">The pope pondered over it for a few moments and then said, "Look busy!" </div>
