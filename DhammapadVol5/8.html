<div id="t1_8" class="t s1_8">First others had told you that mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers, now YOU </div>
<div id="t2_8" class="t s1_8">know -- and that makes the real difference. Information is never transformation. </div>
<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">Buddha says: THE WORLD IS ON FIRE! Fortunate are those who can understand it, not </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">only intellectually but existentially. Can't you see your life is nothing but anguish? Now </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">there are two ways to get rid of this anguish, this fire; one is to become so involved in </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">meaningless things that you can forget your anguish, so that the anguish cannot raise its </div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s1_8">head because you are so occupied: the whole day occupied with money, power, </div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">prestige, running after shadows, and when you come back home you are so utterly tired </div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">that you fall asleep. And then too you remain engaged in your dreams. Dreams are </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">nothing but reflections of your day; the same game continues in your sleep. </div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s1_8">People pass their whole lives in this way. People cannot sit silently even for a few </div>
<div id="tc_8" class="t s1_8">minutes. And the whole Buddhist approach is that unless you are capable of sitting </div>
<div id="td_8" class="t s1_8">silently for hours together, doing nothing, just being, you will never know who you are </div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s1_8">and you will never go beyond your anguish. So the first way is to become occupied, </div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s1_8">involved in anything, whatsoever it is, the only purpose being that you can keep the </div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s1_8">ultimate question of your life repressed. There is no time. </div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s1_8">People come to me, I tell them to meditate. They say, "But we don't have any time." And </div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">these are the same people who are sitting for hours in the movies and they have time. </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">And these are the same people who go to the Rotary Club and just go on doing stupid </div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">things. These are the same people whom you will find in the hotels, at football matches; </div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">these are the same people who will be playing cards and chess, and if you ask them </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">they will say, "We are playing just to kill time." Time is killing you and you think you </div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s1_8">are killing time. Nobody has ever been able to kill time: time kills everybody. </div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s1_8">And when you tell them to meditate the immediate response is, "But where is the time </div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s1_8">to meditate?" And it is not that they are consciously saying it; it is a very unconscious </div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s1_8">reaction. It is not that they are deceiving, they are deceived. It is not that they are just </div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s1_8">trying to deceive you by saying, "I don't have any time," they really feel, they think, that </div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s1_8">they don't have any time. </div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s1_8">THE WORLD IS ON FIRE: </div>

<div id="ty_8" class="t s1_8">ARE the world Buddha is talking about. </div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s1_8">But sometimes it happens... Soren Kierkegaard has a beautiful parable. He says: once in </div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">a circus it happened that suddenly the tent of the circus started burning. Somebody </div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s1_8">may have thrown a lit cigarette or... nobody knows what happened but the tent was on </div>
<div id="t12_8" class="t s1_8">fire. The clown of the circus came to announce it; he announced that "The tent is on </div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s1_8">fire!" and people laughed. They thought, "He is playing a trick on us." And they clapped </div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s1_8">and applauded the clown and the clown was shocked. </div>
