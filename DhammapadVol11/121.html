<div id="t2_121" class="t s1_121">It kept the vampires away alright, but it attracted too many Italians. </div>
<div id="t3_121" class="t s1_121">So if you want to drop garlic, drop it when the British lady has left you; meanwhile she </div>
<div id="t4_121" class="t s1_121">will protect you from the Italians. Every man needs a woman as a protection; otherwise </div>

<div id="t6_121" class="t s1_121">don't bother you. The moment they see you are unprotected they all jump upon you! </div>
<div id="t7_121" class="t s1_121">So first use garlic to get rid of the British lady, then immediately stop garlic; otherwise </div>
<div id="t8_121" class="t s1_121">Italians will start coming. And it is easy to get rid of a British lady; it is next to </div>
<div id="t9_121" class="t s1_121">impossible to get rid of Italian women because they are not ladies. They are true women </div>
<div id="ta_121" class="t s1_121">and they will create so much trouble for you. They help only in one thing: they make </div>

<div id="tc_121" class="t s1_121">that you start thinking of religion, God, meditation. All these great things would not </div>
<div id="td_121" class="t s1_121">have been possible without women. The people who started thinking about all these </div>
<div id="te_121" class="t s1_121">great things were people who were tortured by women. These were their escapes, </div>

<div id="th_121" class="t s1_121">wherever they went some woman was going to create trouble for them. </div>

<div id="tj_121" class="t s1_121">would never have thought of God. He made woman -- the woman is a constant </div>

<div id="tp_121" class="t s1_121">dangerous for any communion, for any communication. It is very medicinal; it will keep </div>
