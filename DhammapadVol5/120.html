<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">And there are a few techniques which have to be done with closed eyes. Then you see </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">the unmanifest God, which is far more important, because the manifestation is </div>

<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">whenever they close their eyes they will be surrounded by me. It will not be a form, it </div>
