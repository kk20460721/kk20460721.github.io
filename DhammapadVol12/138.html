<div id="t3_138" class="t s1_138">trouble has arisen." </div>
<div id="t4_138" class="t s1_138">This Sufi parable is significant, it is about you. That's how you know who you are. Yes, </div>
<div id="t5_138" class="t s1_138">not so visibly; but invisibly how do you recognize yourself? -- in the mirror or in the </div>
<div id="t6_138" class="t s1_138">mirror of other people's eyes, in the mirror of their opinions? </div>
<div id="t7_138" class="t s1_138">Only a buddha is unaffected by others' opinions because he really knows who he is. He </div>
<div id="t8_138" class="t s1_138">needs no arbitrary method, no ropes, no mirrors, no information from anybody else; he </div>
<div id="t9_138" class="t s1_138">knows himself directly. He has an intuitive feeling about his own being, but you don't </div>
<div id="ta_138" class="t s1_138">have any intuitive feeling about your own being. </div>

<div id="tc_138" class="t s1_138">not even around your feet, around your neck! And you are dying because you go on </div>
<div id="td_138" class="t s1_138">getting bigger and the rope was tied when you were a small child; it is becoming tighter </div>

<div id="tf_138" class="t s1_138">Mohammedans, and everybody has a rope around his neck. </div>
<div id="tg_138" class="t s1_138">How do you know you are a Christian? You never encountered Christ. If you had not </div>

<div id="ti_138" class="t s1_138">loved Christ or ever thought about him. No Jaina ever thinks about Christ, no Jew ever </div>
<div id="tj_138" class="t s1_138">bothers about Christ, although Christ was born a Jew, lived as a Jew, died as a Jew. But </div>
<div id="tk_138" class="t s1_138">it is the same. No Christian ever bothers about Mahavira. Who cares about Mahavira? </div>
<div id="tl_138" class="t s1_138">Even if you come across a statue of Mahavira you may look at it as a beautiful piece of </div>
<div id="tm_138" class="t s1_138">art, an antique, or you may be a little puzzled why this man is standing naked. </div>
<div id="tn_138" class="t s1_138">In one of the hotels in Bombay... just a few days ago the hotel opened. It belonged to a </div>
<div id="to_138" class="t s1_138">Jaina family so they placed a statue of Mahavira naked, a marble statue, a beautiful </div>
<div id="tp_138" class="t s1_138">statue, in the compound of the hotel, in a beautiful spot surrounded by plants and </div>
<div id="tq_138" class="t s1_138">fountains. Immediately it became a great attraction for the tourists. And the Jaina family </div>
<div id="tr_138" class="t s1_138">was very happy, thinking, "We are spreading the message of Mahavira." But the tourists </div>
<div id="ts_138" class="t s1_138">were not interested in Mahavira or in his message; they were only interested in his </div>
<div id="tt_138" class="t s1_138">nakedness. They were taking photographs. </div>
<div id="tu_138" class="t s1_138">The manager asked, "Why are you so interested in this statue? Are you interested in </div>
<div id="tv_138" class="t s1_138">Jaina philosophy?" </div>
<div id="tw_138" class="t s1_138">They said, "What Jaina philosophy? We don't know anything about Jaina philosophy, </div>
<div id="tx_138" class="t s1_138">we don't even know who this man is. All that we know is that he is standing naked and </div>
<div id="ty_138" class="t s1_138">we are interested in nudity." </div>
<div id="tz_138" class="t s1_138">Once this was known, the Jaina community was very much against it: "This is insulting </div>
<div id="t10_138" class="t s1_138">to Mahavira. Remove the statue." First they were very happy, now they are against. </div>
<div id="t11_138" class="t s1_138">Now they know perfectly well why people are taking photographs and why tourists are </div>
<div id="t12_138" class="t s1_138">coming to the statue: for the simple reason that it is a statue of a naked, beautiful body -</div>
<div id="t13_138" class="t s1_138">- and Mahavira has a beautiful body. </div>
