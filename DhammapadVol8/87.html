<div id="t1_87" class="t s1_87">Vachana, Christ's message IS rejoice and be merry. But that is not the message of </div>
<div id="t2_87" class="t s1_87">Christianity. Christianity's message is: be sad, long faces, look miserable; the more </div>
<div id="t3_87" class="t s1_87">miserable you look, the more saintly you are. Sometimes I really feel for poor Jesus. He </div>
<div id="t4_87" class="t s1_87">has fallen in such wrong company, and I wonder how he is managing in paradise with </div>
<div id="t5_87" class="t s1_87">all these Christian saints, so sad, so dull. </div>
<div id="t6_87" class="t s1_87">He was not a dull man, he was not a sad man -- he could not be. The word 'christ' is </div>
<div id="t7_87" class="t s1_87">exactly synonymous with buddha. He was an enlightened person. He rejoiced in life, in </div>
<div id="t8_87" class="t s1_87">the small things of life. He rejoiced in eating, drinking, friendship. He loved </div>
<div id="t9_87" class="t s1_87">companionship, he loved the whole life. </div>
<div id="ta_87" class="t s1_87">But Christians down the ages have painted him as very sad. They have painted him </div>
<div id="tb_87" class="t s1_87">always on the cross, as if for thirty-three years he was always on the cross. And my own </div>
<div id="tc_87" class="t s1_87">understanding is that a man like Jesus will not die sad, even on the cross. He must have </div>
<div id="td_87" class="t s1_87">laughed before he died. That's what al-Hillaj Mansoor did before he was killed by the </div>
<div id="te_87" class="t s1_87">fanatic Mohammedans, because he had declared: ANA'L HAQ -- I am God. </div>
<div id="tf_87" class="t s1_87">Mohammedans could not tolerate it, just as Jews could not tolerate Jesus. They killed </div>
<div id="tg_87" class="t s1_87">him -- but before they killed him, he looked at the sky and laughed loudly. </div>
<div id="th_87" class="t s1_87">One hundred thousand people had gathered to see this ugly phenomenon, the murder </div>
<div id="ti_87" class="t s1_87">of one of the greatest human beings who has ever walked on the earth. Somebody asked </div>
<div id="tj_87" class="t s1_87">from the crowd, "al-Hillaj, why are you laughing? You are being killed!" And he was </div>
<div id="tk_87" class="t s1_87">killed in the most cruel way, piece by piece. Jesus' crucifixion is nothing compared to </div>
<div id="tl_87" class="t s1_87">Mansoor's: first his legs were cu off, then his hands were cut off, then his eyes were </div>
<div id="tm_87" class="t s1_87">taken out, then his nose was cut off, then his tongue was cut off, then his head was cut </div>
<div id="tn_87" class="t s1_87">off. They tortured him as much as was possible, but he laughed. Somebody asked, </div>
<div id="to_87" class="t s1_87">"Why are you laughing?" </div>
<div id="tp_87" class="t s1_87">Mansoor said, "I am laughing because the man you are killing is somebody else, I am </div>
<div id="tq_87" class="t s1_87">not he. I am laughing at God too. What is happening? -- have these people gone mad? </div>
<div id="tr_87" class="t s1_87">They are killing somebody else! Me you cannot kill; it is ridiculous, your whole effort is </div>
<div id="ts_87" class="t s1_87">ridiculous. So let it be remembered, let it be on record that I laughed at your </div>
<div id="tt_87" class="t s1_87">foolishness!" </div>
<div id="tu_87" class="t s1_87">And that's exactly what Jesus must have done, laughed. But Christians have tried their </div>
<div id="tv_87" class="t s1_87">best to depict Jesus as sad. They have made a saint out of a real authentic human being; </div>
<div id="tw_87" class="t s1_87">they have cut everything. The gospels are not true stories; much has been changed, </div>
<div id="tx_87" class="t s1_87">much has been reduced, much has been added. They have become mere fictions. </div>
<div id="ty_87" class="t s1_87">Down the ages, Christians have been trying to paint Christ as more and more sad. </div>
<div id="tz_87" class="t s1_87">Why? -- because all over the world religion has been dominated by a neurotic kind of </div>
<div id="t10_87" class="t s1_87">people. It has been dominated by the people who are masochists, sadists. In the East </div>
<div id="t11_87" class="t s1_87">too, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism -- they have all been dominated by the masochistic </div>
<div id="t12_87" class="t s1_87">people, the people who enjoy torturing themselves, the people who are incapable of </div>
<div id="t13_87" class="t s1_87">living life in its totality. The people who are too cowardly to live, escapists, have </div>
<div id="t14_87" class="t s1_87">dominated religion up to now. These escapists have depicted Buddha as not laughing, </div>
<div id="t15_87" class="t s1_87">Mahavira as not laughing. </div>
