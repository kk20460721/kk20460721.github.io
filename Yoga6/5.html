<div id="t1_5" class="t s1_5">am calling you towards dreams. No, Patanjali will not use the word, because </div>
<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">deep down I am saying, "I will make you happy. Come near me; come close to </div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">me. I am ready to make you happy" -- which is impossible. Nobody can make </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">anybody happy. At the most I can say, "I will not hurt you." That is for me, not to </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">hurt, but how can I say, "I will make you happy"? </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">That's why all love leads to frustration. Lovers promise each other -- knowingly, </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">unknowingly -- beautiful roses, paradise; and each one thinking about the </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">promise -- and then it is never fulfilled. Nobody can make you happy -- except </div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">yourself. If you fall in love: the man is thinking the woman is going to give him a </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">beautiful life, an enchanted, a magical world; and the woman is also thinking </div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">that the man is going to lead her towards the last paradise. Nobody can lead </div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">anybody. That's why lovers feel frustrated: the promise was false. Not that they </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">were deceiving each other, they were deceived themselves. Not that they were </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">deliberately deceiving each other, they didn't know. They were not aware what </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">they were saying. </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">Mahavir, Buddha, Patanjali, they use an ugly word: nonviolence, ahimsa. Does </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">not look good, is simply negative -- it says "no violence," that's all. "I will not hurt </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">you" -- that much can be fulfilled. Even then, there is no absolute guarantee that </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">you will not feel hurt. "I will not hurt you," that's all; then too there is no absolute </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">necessity that you will not feel hurt. Still you can feel hurt because you create </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">your own wounds, you create your own misery. "I will not be a party to it," that's </div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">all Patanjali can say -- "I will not participate in it. I will not hurt you." </div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">"When the yogi is firmly established..." in this attitude of nonviolence, that he </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">will not hurt anybody, "... there is an abandonment of enmity by those who are in </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">his presence." Such a man, who is not in any way thinking, dreaming </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">consciously, unconsciously, has no desire to hurt anybody -- in his presence, </div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">abandonment of enmity happens. But before you conclude it, many more </div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">problems arise. </div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">Jesus was crucified; enmity was not abandoned. That's why if you ask Jains they </div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">will not say that he was enlightened, because people could crucify him. But the </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">same has happened to Mahavir. After his enlightenment he was stoned. To </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">Buddha the same has happened -- not crucified, but stoned, insulted. People </div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s1_5">tried to kill him. Then how to understand it? Jains, Buddhists, they have </div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s1_5">explanations. If it is a question of Jesus, they will say he is not enlightened -- </div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s1_5">simple explanation, finished -- but if it is a question of Mahavir they say that he </div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">is closing his accounts of his past lives. Both are wrong. Both are wrong because </div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">when one becomes enlightened he has closed all accounts. He has finished all </div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">karmas; now nothing is there. </div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s1_5">Still, there have been cases: Jesus has been crucified; Socrates poisoned; Al-hillaj </div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s1_5">Mansoor killed, murdered very brutally; Mahavir stoned many times, insulted, </div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s1_5">thrown out of villages; Buddha, many times murder was attempted. Then how to </div>
<div id="t16_5" class="t s1_5">explain Patanjali's sutra? If the sutra is true then these things should not happen. </div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s1_5">If these things happen then there are only two possibilities: either all these </div>
