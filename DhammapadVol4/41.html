<div id="tg_41" class="t s1_41">something. I can only give you one piece of advice that has helped me; it was given to </div>

<div id="ti_41" class="t s1_41">young, you may not be able to understand it right now, but remember, a day will come </div>

<div id="t17_41" class="t s1_41">answer-ing; he would not go back to the boy. If something is utterly wrong, why </div>
<div id="t18_41" class="t s1_41">become enraged? This is a big world, millions of people are there; you cannot go </div>
