<div id="t1_303" class="t s1_303">CHAPTER 21. THREE LOOKING TECHNIQUES</div>
<div id="t2_303" class="t s2_303">One day it happened...</div>
<div id="t3_303" class="t s2_303">and because of it his wife has been condemned for two thousand years</div>
<div id="t4_303" class="t s2_303">continuously, but that is not just, I do not think she has done anything wrong. Socrates was sitting</div>
<div id="t5_303" class="t s2_303">there, and he must have been doing something like this technique – it is not recorded, I am just</div>
<div id="t6_303" class="t s2_303">assuming. His wife came with a tray, a teapot to give him tea. She must have found that he was</div>
<div id="t7_303" class="t s2_303">not there, so it is reported that she poured the tea upon Socrates, over his face. Then suddenly he</div>
<div id="t8_303" class="t s2_303">came back.</div>
<div id="t9_303" class="t s2_303">His face remained burned for his whole life. And because of this his wife has been condemned very</div>
<div id="ta_303" class="t s2_303">much, but no one knows what Socrates was doing there – because no wife would do this suddenly,</div>
<div id="tb_303" class="t s2_303">there is no need. He must have done something; something must have been happening there. That</div>
<div id="tc_303" class="t s2_303">is why Xanthippe had to throw tea over him. He must have been in an inner trance, and the burning</div>
<div id="td_303" class="t s2_303">sensation of the tea must have brought him back, the consciousness must have returned.</div>
<div id="te_303" class="t s2_303">I assume that this was the case because there are many other cases reported about Socrates which</div>
<div id="tf_303" class="t s2_303">are similar. For forty-eight hours he was not found. He was sought all over, the whole Athens went</div>
<div id="tg_303" class="t s2_303">in search of Socrates, but he was not to be found anywhere. Then he was found outside the city,</div>
<div id="th_303" class="t s2_303">miles away, standing under a tree. Half of his body was just under snow. Snow was falling, and he</div>
<div id="ti_303" class="t s2_303">was just frozen, standing there with open eyes. But he was not looking at anyone.</div>
<div id="tj_303" class="t s2_303">When the crowd gathered around, they looked into his eyes and they thought that he was dead. His</div>
<div id="tk_303" class="t s2_303">eyes were just like stones – looking, but not looking at anyone; just static, unmoving. They felt his</div>
<div id="tl_303" class="t s2_303">heart: It was beating slowly; he was alive. They had to give him shocks, only then did he come back</div>
<div id="tm_303" class="t s2_303">to look at them. Immediately he asked, ”What is the time now?” He had missed forty-eight hours</div>
<div id="tn_303" class="t s2_303">completely, they never existed for him. He was not in this world of time and space.</div>
<div id="to_303" class="t s2_303">So they asked, ”What were you doing? We thought you were dead already... forty-eight hours!” He</div>
<div id="tp_303" class="t s2_303">said, ”I was staring at the stars, and just suddenly it happened that the stars disappeared. And then,</div>
<div id="tq_303" class="t s2_303">I don’t know... then the whole world disappeared. But I remained in such a cool, calm, blissful state</div>
<div id="tr_303" class="t s2_303">that if it is death it is worth thousands of lives. If it is death, then I would like to enter it again and</div>
<div id="ts_303" class="t s2_303">again.”</div>
<div id="tt_303" class="t s2_303">It may have happened without his knowledge, because Socrates was not a yogi, not a tantric. He</div>
<div id="tu_303" class="t s2_303">was not in any way concerned consciously with any spiritual practice. But he was a great thinker,</div>
<div id="tv_303" class="t s2_303">and it may have happened as an accident that he was staring at the stars in the night, and suddenly</div>
<div id="tw_303" class="t s2_303">his look returned back, inwards. You can do it. And stars are really good objects.</div>
<div id="tx_303" class="t s2_303">Lie down on the ground, look at the black sky, and then ﬁx yourself on one star. Concentrate on it,</div>
<div id="ty_303" class="t s2_303">stare at it. Narrow down your consciousness to one star; forget other stars. By and by, concentrate,</div>
<div id="tz_303" class="t s2_303">narrow down your gaze. Other stars will be there just on the fringe, on the boundary. But by and by</div>
<div id="t10_303" class="t s2_303">they will disappear, and only one star will remain. Then go on staring, go on staring. A moment will</div>
<div id="t11_303" class="t s2_303">come when that star will disappear. And when that star disappears, you will appear to yourself.</div>
<div id="t12_303" class="t s2_303">The third technique:</div>
<div id="t13_303" class="t s2_303">SEE AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME A BEAUTEOUS PERSON OR AN ORDINARY OBJECT.</div>
<div id="t14_303" class="t s2_303">Some basic things ﬁrst; then you can do this technique. We look at things always with old eyes. You</div>
<div id="t15_303" class="t s2_303">come to your home; you look at it without looking at it. You know it – there is no need to look at it.</div>
<div id="t16_303" class="t s2_303">Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t17_303" class="t s2_303">303</div>
<div id="t18_303" class="t s3_303">Osho</div>
