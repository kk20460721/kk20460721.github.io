<div id="t1_19" class="t s1_19">And the same was the case with Ramakrishna. Many people's emotions were touched, </div>
<div id="t2_19" class="t s1_19">and they would cry tears of joy. But it is not going to transform you. Those tears of joy </div>
<div id="t3_19" class="t s1_19">are momentary; back home you will be the same. </div>
<div id="t4_19" class="t s1_19">Gurdjieff certainly is a pioneer. With Gurdjieff begins a totally new concept of spiritual </div>
<div id="t5_19" class="t s1_19">life. He has actually called his way "the fourth way" -- just as I call my way "the fourth </div>
<div id="t6_19" class="t s1_19">way" he also calls his way "the fourth way." He was immensely misunderstood, because </div>
<div id="t7_19" class="t s1_19">he was not interested in imparting knowledge to you, he was not interested in </div>
<div id="t8_19" class="t s1_19">consoling you. He was not interested in giving you beautiful theories, visions, </div>
<div id="t9_19" class="t s1_19">hallucinations. He was not interested in your tears, in your emotions and sentiments. </div>
<div id="ta_19" class="t s1_19">He was not interested in being worshipped by you, he was interested in transforming </div>
<div id="tb_19" class="t s1_19">you. </div>
<div id="tc_19" class="t s1_19">And to transform a person means you have to take a hammer in your hands, because </div>
<div id="td_19" class="t s1_19">many chunks of that person's being have to be cut. The person is so topsy-turvy that </div>
<div id="te_19" class="t s1_19">everything is wrong as it is, and it has to be put right. And he has invested so much in </div>
<div id="tf_19" class="t s1_19">his wrong way of life that anybody who wants to change his style of life -- not only the </div>
<div id="tg_19" class="t s1_19">circumference but the center too -- he becomes afraid of, he is scared of. Only a few </div>
<div id="th_19" class="t s1_19">courageous people can enter into the world of a man like Gurdjieff. Tremendous </div>
<div id="ti_19" class="t s1_19">courage is needed, a courage to die, because only then is one reborn. </div>
<div id="tj_19" class="t s1_19">Gurdjieff was a midwife. He was not a teacher, he was a master. Krishnamurti </div>
<div id="tk_19" class="t s1_19">remained a teacher. Raman remained a beautiful individual -- enlightened, but just a </div>
<div id="tl_19" class="t s1_19">faraway, distant star. You could watch and you could appreciate and you could write </div>
<div id="tm_19" class="t s1_19">poetry about it, but that's all. It remained a distant phenomenon. You could never hope </div>
<div id="tn_19" class="t s1_19">to reach him, the distance was vast. And there was no effort from his side to bridge it. </div>
<div id="to_19" class="t s1_19">And what could you do? How could YOU bridge it? If you had been capable of </div>
<div id="tp_19" class="t s1_19">bridging yourself with a man like Raman, there would have been no need to make the </div>
<div id="tq_19" class="t s1_19">bridge. A man of that capacity would be able to transform himself on his own; he </div>
<div id="tr_19" class="t s1_19">would not need a master. Unless Raman tried to make the bridge, the bridge was not </div>
<div id="ts_19" class="t s1_19">possible. </div>
<div id="tt_19" class="t s1_19">And he was aloof, distant, cool. He was not involved. He knew all misery is false. And, </div>
<div id="tu_19" class="t s1_19">certainly, it is so -- but not for those who are in misery. The man who is awake knows </div>
<div id="tv_19" class="t s1_19">that the person who is crying and weeping in his sleep is seeing a dream, true. As far as </div>
<div id="tw_19" class="t s1_19">the man who is awake is concerned, it's perfectly true. But even though it is a dream, a </div>
<div id="tx_19" class="t s1_19">nightmare, for the person who is fast asleep it is a truth. And the man who is fast asleep </div>
<div id="ty_19" class="t s1_19">cannot make any effort to connect himself with the awakened man. Obviously, it is </div>
<div id="tz_19" class="t s1_19">impossible. He cannot even be aware that somebody is awake; he is so much engrossed </div>
<div id="t10_19" class="t s1_19">in his nightmare. Only the awakened can make the effort. But to disturb somebody's </div>
<div id="t11_19" class="t s1_19">sleep, even though he is in a nightmare, is dangerous. Nobody wants to be disturbed, </div>
<div id="t12_19" class="t s1_19">nobody wants to be interfered with. </div>
<div id="t13_19" class="t s1_19">People have strange ideas -- sleepy people, idiotic people, but they have strange ideas of </div>
<div id="t14_19" class="t s1_19">freedom. They have no freedom; they can't have. They can't afford it in their sleep. How </div>
<div id="t15_19" class="t s1_19">can a sleepy man have any freedom? But they have ideas, great ideas of freedom, and a </div>
<div id="t16_19" class="t s1_19">man like Gurdjieff interferes. His compassion is far greater than the compassion of J. </div>
<div id="t17_19" class="t s1_19">Krishnamurti, Raman, and Ramakrishna. </div>
