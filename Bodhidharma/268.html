<div id="t1_268" class="t s1_268">It happened ...I was in Raipur teaching in the Sanskrit college there. A very </div>
<div id="t2_268" class="t s1_268">beautiful young girl was asked by a gangster if she would be married to him. He </div>
<div id="t3_268" class="t s1_268">was a dangerous man, a criminal. He had been to jail many times, he had </div>
<div id="t4_268" class="t s1_268">committed many crimes, and he was almost the same age as the girl's father. But </div>
<div id="t5_268" class="t s1_268">he took a fancy to her, and seeing the success of Gandhi fasting to death and how </div>
<div id="t6_268" class="t s1_268">he managed everything ...because Gandhi HAD managed Ambedkar. </div>
<div id="t7_268" class="t s1_268">After Gandhi had been fasting for twenty-one days, and his health had started to </div>
<div id="t8_268" class="t s1_268">fall fast, the doctor said, "Do something; otherwise the old man will be gone." </div>
<div id="t9_268" class="t s1_268">Ambedkar was much pressurized by all the Indian national leaders who said to </div>
<div id="ta_268" class="t s1_268">him, "Go to Mahatma Gandhi. Ask for his forgiveness, offer him a glass of orange </div>
<div id="tb_268" class="t s1_268">juice to break his fast ...and renounce your movement; otherwise you will be </div>
<div id="tc_268" class="t s1_268">remembered always as the one who killed the greatest man of this country, the </div>
<div id="td_268" class="t s1_268">great religious man." And Ambedkar had to do it, although unwillingly. </div>
<div id="te_268" class="t s1_268">I would not have done it! I would have accepted the blame, I would have </div>
<div id="tf_268" class="t s1_268">accepted history's condemnation. Who cares when you are dead what is written </div>
<div id="tg_268" class="t s1_268">in history about you? At least you don't know what is written, and you don't </div>
<div id="th_268" class="t s1_268">read. Let them write anything </div>
<div id="ti_268" class="t s1_268">....</div>
<div id="tj_268" class="t s1_268">But I would have insisted that this was not a nonviolent method. It was </div>
<div id="tk_268" class="t s1_268">absolutely violent but in a very subtle way. I threaten to kill you -- this is </div>
<div id="tl_268" class="t s1_268">violence. And I threaten to kill myself if you don't accept me -- is this logical? The </div>
<div id="tm_268" class="t s1_268">standpoint that Gandhi was taking was absolutely illogical, but he supported it </div>
<div id="tn_268" class="t s1_268">by threatening. It is blackmail to say, "I will kill myself." </div>
<div id="to_268" class="t s1_268">Ambedkar managed another way. He started converting the sudras to </div>
<div id="tp_268" class="t s1_268">Buddhism. That's why now there are a few lakhs of Buddhists, but they are not </div>
<div id="tq_268" class="t s1_268">in any way religious. It was just a political manoeuver. </div>
<div id="tr_268" class="t s1_268">This man in Raipur went to the girl's house with a bed, and declared that if the </div>
<div id="ts_268" class="t s1_268">girl was not married to him, he was going to fast to death. It became the talk of </div>
<div id="tt_268" class="t s1_268">the whole city; photographers and journalists were there, and the whole day the </div>
<div id="tu_268" class="t s1_268">crowd was there. The father became afraid, and pressure was put on him, "Why </div>
<div id="tv_268" class="t s1_268">take the responsibility of his death?" But the father said, "This is absolutely ugly. </div>
<div id="tw_268" class="t s1_268">This man is my age and he's a criminal. I cannot give my daughter to him." </div>
<div id="tx_268" class="t s1_268">I knew the father and the girl -- the girl was my student in the college. The girl </div>
<div id="ty_268" class="t s1_268">suggested to her father to consult me as to what could be done. I had not known </div>
<div id="tz_268" class="t s1_268">him before. He came to me and he told the whole story. I said, "It is very simple. </div>
<div id="t10_268" class="t s1_268">You just find some old, rotten prostitute." </div>
<div id="t11_268" class="t s1_268">He said, "What?" </div>
<div id="t12_268" class="t s1_268">I said, "Just listen to the whole point: find a very rotten, old bitch, and put </div>
<div id="t13_268" class="t s1_268">another bed in front of the house. The bitch should declare, `I'm going to fast to </div>
<div id="t14_268" class="t s1_268">death unless this man marries me.' Other than this nothing will work." </div>
<div id="t15_268" class="t s1_268">That gangster man escaped in the middle of the night. He was never seen again, </div>
<div id="t16_268" class="t s1_268">he never asked again! This is the Gandhian methodology, a very religious thing. </div>
<div id="t17_268" class="t s1_268">The Buddhists were burned, driven out of the country, and the whole country </div>
<div id="t18_268" class="t s1_268">was absolutely cleaned of all the impact that Buddha had left. Even in the temple </div>
