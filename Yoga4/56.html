<div id="t1_56" class="t s1_56">The first thing that should be asked of Jung is, 'Have you realized yourself?' But </div>
<div id="t2_56" class="t s1_56">he was really very egoistic. He was thinking that he had realized. He was </div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s1_56">reluctant to come to India. Only once he came, and he was reluctant to go and </div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s1_56">see a saint, even a saint like Ramana Maharshi. He was reluctant, he would not </div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s1_56">go. What was there for him to learn? -- he had everything already. And he knew </div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s1_56">nothing, just a few fragments of some dreams that he had interpreted -- and he </div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s1_56">thought that he had interpreted life. </div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s1_56">You go on interpreting dreams, and you think dreams are the reality. In the East </div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s1_56">our standpoint is just the opposite. We have been looking into life and we have </div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s1_56">found that life itself is a dream. You think that by interpreting dreams you have </div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s1_56">interpreted reality. Just on the contrary, we have looked into life and found that </div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s1_56">it is nothing but a dream. And why this reluctance? The East was a fear to Jung. </div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s1_56">He was afraid of the East and there was something in it: he was afraid of the East </div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s1_56">because the East would reveal the reality of his own understanding -- that it was </div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s1_56">false. Had he been to Ramana, had he been to some other mystic in the East, he </div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s1_56">would have immediately realized that whatsoever he had attained was nothing. </div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s1_56">It was just on the steps of the temple. He had not entered the shrine yet. But in </div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s1_56">the West, anything goes. Without their knowing what self-rea]ization is, they call </div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s1_56">it self realization. You can call it any thing; it depends on you. </div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s1_56">Self realization is coming to no-self, coming to an absolute emptiness within, </div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s1_56">coming to the point where you are not. The drop has dissolved into the ocean </div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s1_56">and only the ocean exists. Then who dreams? Then who is left there to dream? </div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s1_56">The house is empty, there is nobody. </div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s1_56">The second question: </div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s1_56">Question 2 </div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s1_56">YOU SAID THAT IMITATION OF ANY KIND, EVEN IMITATION OF A </div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s1_56">BUDDHA, IS ALIEN TO PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. BUT WE SEE THAT ALL </div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s1_56">OUR CULTURAL LIFE IS NOTHING BUT IMITATION. IN THAT CASE, IS </div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s1_56">CULTURE ITSELF ALIEN TO RELIGION? </div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s1_56">Yes, culture, society, civilization, all are alien to religion. Religion is a revolution, </div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s1_56">a revolution in your cultural condition ing, a revolution in your social </div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s1_56">conditioning, a revolution in all the spheres that you have lived and you are </div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s1_56">living. Every society is against religion. I'm not talking about your temples and </div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s1_56">mosques and churches that society has created. Those are tricks. Those are things </div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s1_56">to befool you. Those are substitutes for religion, they are not religion. They are to </div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s1_56">misguide you. You need religion: they say, 'Yes, come to the temple, to the </div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s1_56">church, to the gurudwara. Here it is religion. You come and pray and the </div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s1_56">preacher is there who will teach you religion.' This is a trick. Society has created </div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s1_56">false religions: those religions are Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism. But a Buddha, </div>
