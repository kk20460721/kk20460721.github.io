<div id="t1_54" class="t s1_54">if you have learned meditation. I cannot give you anything else. This whole kingdom is </div>
<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">worthless; this is not your true heritage. I will not be happy giving you only this </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">kingdom; I will be happy if I can help you to meditate." </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">So the prince came to the Zen master and he said, "I am in a hurry. My father is old, he </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">can die any moment." </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">The master said, "The first principle of meditation is not to be in a hurry. Impatience </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">won't do. Get lost, get out! Never come here again! Try to find some pseudo master who </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">will give you a mantra to chant and will console you with 'Go on chanting fifteen </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">minutes in the morning and fifteen in the evening and you will become enlightened.' </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">"But if you want to be here, forget time, because meditation is a search for eternity. And </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">forget all about your old father -- nobody ever dies, believe me. One day you will see </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">that what I am saying is true. Neither anybody ever gets old nor ever dies. Don't be </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">worried. I know your father, because he has learned meditation from me. He is not </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">going to die -- his body may die. But you will have to forget all about your father and </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">your kingdom if you want to learn meditation. It needs one-pointed devotion." </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">The master was such, his impact was such, the young man decided to stay. </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">Three years passed. The master never said a single word about meditation. The young </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">man served the master in every possible way, waited and waited, and he was afraid to </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">mention the subject because he might say, "Get lost -- you are in a hurry!" So he could </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">not say even that. </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">But three years is too much. Finally one day he said in the morning -- the master was </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">sitting under a tree taking a sunbath -- he said, "Sir, three years have passed. Are you </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">aware? And you have not even told me what to do, what is meditation." </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">The master looked at him and said, "So you are still in a hurry! Okay, today I will start </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">teaching you meditation." </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">And he started teaching in a very strange way. The young man was cleaning the floor of </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">the temple and the master would come from the back and hit him hard with a wooden </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">sword -- really hard he would hit him! The young man would be reading the Buddhist </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">sutras, and he would come from behind. And he was such a silent man that you would </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">not even be able to hear his footsteps. And suddenly, out of nowhere, the hit -- the </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">wooden sword would descend on him. </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">The young man thought, "What kind of meditation is this?" In seven days he was </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">feeling so tired and wounded and scratched. He asked, "What are you doing? You go </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">on hitting me!" </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">The master said, "This is my way of teaching. Be alert, be very conscious, so before I hit </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">you, you can dodge -- that's the only way." </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">There was no other escape, so the young man had to be very alert. He was reading the </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">book but he was alert, conscious. Slowly slowly, within two, three weeks, he started </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">hearing the footsteps of the master -- and his walk was almost like a cat's. When the cat </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">goes to catch the rat she walks so silently. The master was really an old cat! </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">But the young man became alert enough; he started hearing his footsteps. Within three </div>
<div id="t16_54" class="t s1_54">months the master was unable to hit him even a single time. Twenty-four hours a day </div>
<div id="t17_54" class="t s1_54">he would try, but the young man would dodge and jump, whatsoever he was doing. </div>
