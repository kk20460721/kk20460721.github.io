<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">By coincidence that boy must have been one of those people, and those three tried hard </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">to hypnotize him. They hypnotized him and they were feeling great, because </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">whatsoever they were saying, he was doing. They told him to dance, he danced. They </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">told him that, "This is very hot water," and they gave him ice-cold water, and he could </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">not drink it. He said, "It is too hot, my mouth will be burned." And they were surprised </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">when they put a small pebble on the palm of the hypnotized person and told him that, </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">"This is fire." He was already burned, immediately burned, actually burned -- by a cold </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">pebble. They became more and more intrigued by the whole phenomenon. </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">They tried the last thing. They told the person to lie down and they told him, "You are </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">dead!" -- and he died. Then they tried hard to wake him up, but it was too late. Because </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">of that incident many countries have made laws against hypnosis. Only authorized </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">professionals should be allowed to use it because it can be dangerous. It can affect your </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">mind, and through the mind your body. </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">Mind and body are not separate, but YOU are a third entity. You are in the body, in the </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">mind, but you are not identified with them. You are a witnessing consciousness. </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">My work is totally different from Hubbard's work: his work is psychological, my work </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">is spiritual. My effort here is not to give you a clear mind; my effort here is to give you a </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">state of no-mind, because only through no-mind will you be able to know the reality -- </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">the reality within and the reality without. But the no-mind is the door, the only door. </div>

<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">WHY IS IT THAT THE JOURNALISTS NEVER SEEM TO UNDERSTAND YOU? </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">Kavyo, it has nothing to do with me. They have never understood Jesus, Socrates, </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">Buddha, Kabir. They cannot understand; it is against their investment. </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">The journalist lives on creating sensations. Any news is news only when it is sensation. </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">They live on rumors and they have to make rumors very spicy. They have no interest in </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">truth, because truth is never news. Truth is so ancient, truth is always the same. I am </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">saying the same truth. Buddha said it, Christ said it, and all those who have known. It is </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">nothing new -- how it can be news? </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">And they come here in search of news. They have to invent -- and it is really interesting </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">how inventive people can be. </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">Just a few days ago I was reading a report in a Punjabi magazine about this commune, </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">this ashram. The man says, the journalist says, that he has been here for fifteen days, </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">stayed in the commune, and whatsoever he is writing is based on his own experience. </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">Because he introduced his article in this way I became interested: what has he seen? So I </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">went through it. Ordinarily I don't read what journalists go on writing, it is impossible. </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">We have a big press department for that, at least thirty persons continuously reading </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">and collecting, because it is happening all over the world, in all the languages. So much </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">is being published that it is impossible for me to keep any track of it. But because this </div>
