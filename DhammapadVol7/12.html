<div id="t1_12" class="t s1_12">An old country doctor found his work load too heavy and managed to persuade a </div>
<div id="t2_12" class="t s1_12">young doctor to share his practice. "Just remember, son," cautioned the older man, </div>
<div id="t3_12" class="t s1_12">"these are simple country folk. They don't have much of a way with words, and </div>
<div id="t4_12" class="t s1_12">sometimes they won't be able to describe their symptoms accurately. But just keep your </div>
<div id="t5_12" class="t s1_12">eyes open, and you will be able to diagnose their ailments with no trouble at all." </div>
<div id="t6_12" class="t s1_12">That very evening the two doctors were called to the aid of a beautiful young girl who </div>
<div id="t7_12" class="t s1_12">lay in a stupor. The older doctor took her pulse while the younger man tried to take her </div>
<div id="t8_12" class="t s1_12">temperature. His efforts only seemed to upset her, and her violent tossing and turning </div>
<div id="t9_12" class="t s1_12">caused him to drop the thermometer. He bent over and picked it up and put it back in </div>
<div id="ta_12" class="t s1_12">his bag. </div>
<div id="tb_12" class="t s1_12">He waved the older doctor aside and whispered a few words into the young woman's </div>
<div id="tc_12" class="t s1_12">ear. Whatever he said seemed to soothe her and the two men went on their way. When </div>
<div id="td_12" class="t s1_12">they got in the car, the old doctor demanded to know what the young man had said to </div>
<div id="te_12" class="t s1_12">the patient. </div>
<div id="tf_12" class="t s1_12">"I simply told her she would have to cut down on her political activity." </div>
<div id="tg_12" class="t s1_12">"Now that is ridiculous," exclaimed the old practitioner. "She was practically in a coma, </div>
<div id="th_12" class="t s1_12">and you thought it was politics? You are a fool!" </div>
<div id="ti_12" class="t s1_12">"No, sir. I just did what you told me to do. I just kept my eyes open." </div>
<div id="tj_12" class="t s1_12">"Now what is that supposed to mean?" demanded the irate physician. </div>
<div id="tk_12" class="t s1_12">"Well, when I bent over to pick up the thermometer, I saw the mayor under the bed." </div>
<div id="tl_12" class="t s1_12">Yes, once in a while accidentally, you may be able to understand a part of the message. </div>
<div id="tm_12" class="t s1_12">But the part cannot be of much help. An accidental understanding is not liberation. </div>
<div id="tn_12" class="t s1_12">Understanding has to be deliberate and conscious. </div>
<div id="to_12" class="t s1_12">Now, this young doctor will do it again and again -- everywhere, wherever he will go, </div>
<div id="tp_12" class="t s1_12">he will look under the bed. You can't hope that you will find mayors everywhere, and </div>
<div id="tq_12" class="t s1_12">he will be at a loss. This time it worked. And sometimes a few wrong things can work. </div>
<div id="tr_12" class="t s1_12">And once they work you become obsessed with them, and you start trying them in </div>
<div id="ts_12" class="t s1_12">every possible way, hoping that they will become your very life-style. They will simply </div>
<div id="tt_12" class="t s1_12">create chaos. </div>
<div id="tu_12" class="t s1_12">Hence on the path it is absolutely necessary to be a disciple, so that a constant source of </div>
<div id="tv_12" class="t s1_12">light remains available to you; so the master can go on forcing you to see things as they </div>
<div id="tw_12" class="t s1_12">are, and helping you to become deliberately conscious. </div>
<div id="tx_12" class="t s1_12">It is a long, arduous process, much hammering is needed on your head. You have </div>
<div id="ty_12" class="t s1_12">remained unconscious for so long that unconsciousness has become your second </div>
<div id="tz_12" class="t s1_12">nature, and it has grown so thick, that unless these rocks of unconsciousness are broken, </div>
<div id="t10_12" class="t s1_12">waters of consciousness will not flow in your being. The first thing you can do is, start </div>
<div id="t11_12" class="t s1_12">uprooting the weeds of desire: all kinds of desire, worldly and otherworldly. </div>
<div id="t12_12" class="t s1_12">That's why Buddha never talks of heaven, never talks about heavenly pleasures, never </div>
<div id="t13_12" class="t s1_12">talks about moksha, nirvana. He never says to his disciples that great bliss is waiting for </div>
<div id="t14_12" class="t s1_12">you, but goes on insisting: be desireless, be alert, be aware. Because if you say to people </div>
<div id="t15_12" class="t s1_12">that great joy is waiting for you if you become desireless, they can try to become </div>
