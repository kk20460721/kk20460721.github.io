<div id="t1_429" class="t s1_429">CHAPTER 27. ONE MA, ONE SWAMI – AND WE CAN START THE WHOLE GAME AGAIN</div>
<div id="t2_429" class="t s2_429">I said, ”Because this man seems to be wiser than any of your teachers – including you. What was</div>
<div id="t3_429" class="t s2_429">the point of his ﬁghting? His defeat was sure. He saved you from being a defeated school. You</div>
<div id="t4_429" class="t s2_429">are not defeated; you are not victorious but you are not defeated either. And he made the whole</div>
<div id="t5_429" class="t s2_429">situation hilarious, not something to weep and cry over.</div>
<div id="t6_429" class="t s2_429">”In fact he made the other man look silly, because standing there ready to ﬁght he looked so silly</div>
<div id="t7_429" class="t s2_429">that whenever I use the word silly, I see his picture immediately. He could not understand and ﬁgure</div>
<div id="t8_429" class="t s2_429">out what was happening! This man was Lying ﬂat” – because that’s the way in India: the man has</div>
<div id="t9_429" class="t s2_429">to lie down ﬂat, his whole back, both the shoulders touching the ground. Unless this happens the</div>
<div id="ta_429" class="t s2_429">wrestling continues; one of the two wrestlers has to touch the ground.</div>
<div id="tb_429" class="t s2_429">”That man was standing there and this man was laughing, and he said, ’Now, what do you want? –</div>
<div id="tc_429" class="t s2_429">can I get up? Or if it pleases you I can lie down – there is no problem.’ And the whole crowd that</div>
<div id="td_429" class="t s2_429">had come to see the wrestling for a moment was stunned.”</div>
<div id="te_429" class="t s2_429">I told the principal, ”This boy did something spontaneous. He is a good wrestler, he has won the</div>
<div id="tf_429" class="t s2_429">school competition; he has defeated all other wrestlers in the school. He is a good wrestler – you</div>
<div id="tg_429" class="t s2_429">cannot say that he cannot wrestle – but this situation was so clear, that the other man was double</div>
<div id="th_429" class="t s2_429">his size. He looked like a professional wrestler, and I doubt” – and my doubt was proved right...”I</div>
<div id="ti_429" class="t s2_429">believe that he is hired, that he does not really study in the school, because his age seems to be</div>
<div id="tj_429" class="t s2_429">....</div>
<div id="tk_429" class="t s2_429">”</div>
<div id="tl_429" class="t s2_429">And I told the principal, ”This should be inquired into. I don’t think that man studies in the school.”</div>
<div id="tm_429" class="t s2_429">And that was the truth – he was hired; and the school had come from so far away that of course in</div>
<div id="tn_429" class="t s2_429">our city nobody knew the man, nobody knew whether or not he studied. And sometimes it happens;</div>
<div id="to_429" class="t s2_429">a few people go on failing and they remain behind.</div>
<div id="tp_429" class="t s2_429">In my school I had one person who was failing for eleven years in the same matric class.</div>
<div id="tq_429" class="t s2_429">The</div>
<div id="tr_429" class="t s2_429">people who had studied with him had become teachers – and he never passed. But the principal,</div>
<div id="ts_429" class="t s2_429">the teachers, the school, all wanted him to remain; they said, ”Don’t leave the school,” because he</div>
<div id="tt_429" class="t s2_429">was good at many things.</div>
<div id="tu_429" class="t s2_429">I have seen many people playing hockey but that man was simply magical. In America, hockey is not</div>
<div id="tv_429" class="t s2_429">as prominent a game as football, but in India – because of Britain – hockey is the most signiﬁcant</div>
<div id="tw_429" class="t s2_429">game. And this is the one man... I have seen many people playing hockey but the magical touch</div>
<div id="tx_429" class="t s2_429">that he had was such that the ball almost seemed glued to his stick.</div>
<div id="ty_429" class="t s2_429">And when he was moving, his movements were so fast, so quick, that you could not catch him.</div>
<div id="tz_429" class="t s2_429">Where he was going... what he was doing was so quick and so fast and the ball continued to remain</div>
<div id="t10_429" class="t s2_429">glued, almost glued to his stick. I had even tried to see whether he did really use maybe some glue</div>
<div id="t11_429" class="t s2_429">or something that made the ball remain glued – and he went on moving easily.</div>
<div id="t12_429" class="t s2_429">But it was not the case; it was just that his movements were really trained. Eleven years continuous</div>
<div id="t13_429" class="t s2_429">training... everybody was just a child in front of him. So the school was happy that he went on failing</div>
<div id="t14_429" class="t s2_429">because he was making the school the champion of the whole province.</div>
<div id="t15_429" class="t s2_429">So we thought perhaps that wrestler was failing or something; but it was found that he was hired:</div>
<div id="t16_429" class="t s2_429">he was a professional wrestler.</div>
<div id="t17_429" class="t s2_429">Then I told my principal, ”What do you want now?</div>
<div id="t18_429" class="t s2_429">You have to</div>
<div id="t19_429" class="t s2_429">From Misery to Enlightenment</div>
<div id="t1a_429" class="t s2_429">429</div>
<div id="t1b_429" class="t s3_429">Osho</div>
