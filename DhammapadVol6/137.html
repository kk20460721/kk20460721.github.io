<div id="t2_137" class="t s1_137">form, you will miss other buddhas. </div>
<div id="t3_137" class="t s1_137">In Holland there was a conference arranged by Krishnamurti followers. Krishnamurti </div>
<div id="t4_137" class="t s1_137">was coming there and staying with the people for seven days. His disciples had </div>
<div id="t5_137" class="t s1_137">gathered from all over the world. One woman went from India but after two, three days </div>
<div id="t6_137" class="t s1_137">she was back. </div>
<div id="t7_137" class="t s1_137">She came to see me. I said, "You came back so early? Is the conference finished?" She </div>
<div id="t8_137" class="t s1_137">said, "No, the conference is not finished but I am finished with Krishnamurti." I said, </div>
<div id="t9_137" class="t s1_137">"What happened?" She said, "I had gone shopping and I saw Krishnamurti purchasing a </div>
<div id="ta_137" class="t s1_137">necktie, and not only purchasing a necktie but making such a fuss. At least two </div>
<div id="tb_137" class="t s1_137">hundred neckties were spread all over the table and nothing was liked by him. </div>
<div id="tc_137" class="t s1_137">Something was wrong with everything: some color was wrong, the size was wrong, this </div>
<div id="td_137" class="t s1_137">was wrong, that was wrong." And she said, "I simply watched what he was doing. Is he </div>
<div id="te_137" class="t s1_137">a buddha? A buddha purchasing, shopping? A buddha looks good with a begging bowl </div>
<div id="tf_137" class="t s1_137">but a buddha purchasing -- and what? A necktie! And then too, he is making so much </div>
<div id="tg_137" class="t s1_137">fuss." </div>
<div id="th_137" class="t s1_137">Krishnamurti is very fastidious about his clothes. She became so frustrated, she did not </div>
<div id="ti_137" class="t s1_137">attend the conference. What is the point now? This man is not a buddha. Now, what to </div>
<div id="tj_137" class="t s1_137">do with this woman -- to weep for her or to laugh at her? One can weep for her </div>
<div id="tk_137" class="t s1_137">stupidity because Krishnamurti is Krishnamurti; he is not Gautama the Buddha, he is </div>
<div id="tl_137" class="t s1_137">not Jesus Christ. He has his unique way of living, of expressing. He is not a renunciate, </div>
<div id="tm_137" class="t s1_137">he lives in the world. And to see the point, that he lives in the world and yet is not of it, </div>
<div id="tn_137" class="t s1_137">needs great understanding inside. This woman missed. </div>
<div id="to_137" class="t s1_137">What to do with this woman? To weep for her? She went to Holland without even </div>
<div id="tp_137" class="t s1_137">listening to a single talk of Krishnamurti</div>
<div id="tq_137" class="t s1_137">....</div>
<div id="tr_137" class="t s1_137">Or to laugh at her stupidity? And one never </div>

<div id="tt_137" class="t s1_137">that she is watching he may have made so much fuss... because people like </div>
<div id="tu_137" class="t s1_137">Krishnamurti always want to get rid of the rubbish type of people, the stupid type of </div>
<div id="tv_137" class="t s1_137">people. </div>
<div id="tw_137" class="t s1_137">Gurdjieff used to do many things just to get rid of unnecessary people. Sometimes he </div>
<div id="tx_137" class="t s1_137">would behave so absurdly that the person who had come to see him would never come </div>
<div id="ty_137" class="t s1_137">again -- thinking that he was mad. One day he is sitting drinking tea with two, three </div>
<div id="tz_137" class="t s1_137">disciples and a journalist comes to see him. He was always against journalists entering </div>
<div id="t10_137" class="t s1_137">into his ashram because this was his understanding: that they are bent upon </div>
<div id="t11_137" class="t s1_137">misunderstanding. </div>
<div id="t12_137" class="t s1_137">He asked the journalist, very courteously, to sit and have some tea, some cake. The </div>
<div id="t13_137" class="t s1_137">journalist was very happy because he had heard that Gurdjieff always throws </div>
<div id="t14_137" class="t s1_137">journalists out, he tells them in no uncertain terms to get lost! He was very happy that </div>
<div id="t15_137" class="t s1_137">he was being received with such love and compassion. </div>
<div id="t16_137" class="t s1_137">And then Gurdjieff asked the woman sitting by his side, "What day was yesterday?" </div>
<div id="t17_137" class="t s1_137">She said, "Friday." </div>
