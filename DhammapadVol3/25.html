<div id="t1_25" class="t s1_25">Lao Tzu insisted his whole life that he would not write anything about truth. When </div>
<div id="t2_25" class="t s1_25">finally he was forced to write -- he was really forced to write... that is the only great </div>
<div id="t3_25" class="t s1_25">scripture which has been written at the point of a bayonet! </div>
<div id="t4_25" class="t s1_25">Lao Tzu was leaving China in his very old age... and you can think of his old age, </div>
<div id="t5_25" class="t s1_25">because when he was born the story is he was eighty-two -- when he was born! So you </div>
<div id="t6_25" class="t s1_25">can imagine how much older he must have been when he died. He was already eighty-</div>
<div id="t7_25" class="t s1_25">two when he was born! A beautiful story, which simply says that he was so mature </div>
<div id="t8_25" class="t s1_25">when he was born that he was a child but never childish. And remember the distance </div>
<div id="t9_25" class="t s1_25">and difference between a child and the one who is childish. </div>
<div id="ta_25" class="t s1_25">When Jesus says, "Those who are like children..." he is not talking about childish people; </div>
<div id="tb_25" class="t s1_25">he is talking about innocent people. Lao Tzu must have been so innocent that the people </div>
<div id="tc_25" class="t s1_25">who wrote about him could not write that he was only nine months old. His innocence </div>
<div id="td_25" class="t s1_25">was so deep and so profound that it cannot be attained in only nine months; hence they </div>
<div id="te_25" class="t s1_25">thought he was at least eighty-two years old. He was born with white hair. You can </div>
<div id="tf_25" class="t s1_25">look at Paritosh: he must have been born like Paritosh -- pure white hair! </div>
<div id="tg_25" class="t s1_25">So when he was old -- nobody knows how old, people must have lost track of his age -- </div>
<div id="th_25" class="t s1_25">when he felt, "Now it is time to leave the body," he started moving towards the </div>
<div id="ti_25" class="t s1_25">Himalayas, because there is no other place more beautiful to die. </div>
<div id="tj_25" class="t s1_25">Death should be a celebration! Death should be in nature, under the trees and the stars </div>
<div id="tk_25" class="t s1_25">and the sun and the moon. The whole life he had lived with people; now he wanted to </div>
<div id="tl_25" class="t s1_25">go back to nature, and before he entered into the ultimate he wanted to die amidst trees </div>
<div id="tm_25" class="t s1_25">and mountains and virgin peaks. </div>
<div id="tn_25" class="t s1_25">But the king of the country ordered all the guards on all the boundaries, "Don't allow </div>
<div id="to_25" class="t s1_25">Lao Tzu to escape. Wherever he is caught, force him to write down his experiences, </div>
<div id="tp_25" class="t s1_25">because he has something invaluable and we cannot allow this man to escape taking it </div>
<div id="tq_25" class="t s1_25">with him." </div>
<div id="tr_25" class="t s1_25">He was caught at one of the posts and the policeman insisted, "You have to write it </div>
<div id="ts_25" class="t s1_25">down; otherwise I will not allow you to leave the country." </div>
<div id="tt_25" class="t s1_25">So sitting in the policeman's hut, and the policeman with his bayonet, Lao Tzu wrote </div>
<div id="tu_25" class="t s1_25">TAO TEH CHING. </div>
<div id="tv_25" class="t s1_25">The first sentence is: "Truth cannot be said, and that which can be said is not truth </div>
<div id="tw_25" class="t s1_25">anymore." </div>
<div id="tx_25" class="t s1_25">No great scripture begins with such a beautiful sentence. He is saying, "If you have </div>
<div id="ty_25" class="t s1_25">understood this sentence, please don't read on." He deceived the policeman. How can a </div>
<div id="tz_25" class="t s1_25">policeman understand what he is writing? But he deceived. The first statement simply </div>
<div id="t10_25" class="t s1_25">states that there is no need to read any more: if you have understood this you have </div>
<div id="t11_25" class="t s1_25">understood all. </div>
<div id="t12_25" class="t s1_25">"The tao that can be said is no longer tao." The moment you say it you falsify it. Truth is </div>
<div id="t13_25" class="t s1_25">so simple it cannot be uttered, words are complex, languages are complex. Truth is so </div>
<div id="t14_25" class="t s1_25">simple it can be indicated. Hence Buddha says, "Buddhas can only show you the way," </div>
<div id="t15_25" class="t s1_25">and Zen masters say, "Don't cling to our words -- our words are nothing but fingers </div>
<div id="t16_25" class="t s1_25">pointing to the moon." And remember, the fingers are not the moon! The moon has </div>
<div id="t17_25" class="t s1_25">nothing to do with fingers, but you can only indicate. </div>
