<div id="t2_68" class="t s1_68">although I know there will be many temptations." If somebody is saying that, you will </div>
<div id="t3_68" class="t s1_68">laugh. "What nonsense he is talking! What temptations?" Have you ever been tempted </div>
<div id="t4_68" class="t s1_68">by the wall to get in and out through it? No such temptation is there. </div>
<div id="t5_68" class="t s1_68">When one can see clearly, good results. It is so natural, it is so spontaneous, you can't </div>
<div id="t6_68" class="t s1_68">say that you have decided it. You can't say that you have used your will. You can't even </div>
<div id="t7_68" class="t s1_68">say that this is your act. All that you can say is that this is how things are happening, </div>
<div id="t8_68" class="t s1_68">not that you are doing them, you are only allowing them to happen. Then life has such </div>
<div id="t9_68" class="t s1_68">a relaxed joy, because no tension follows it, no strain. The achieving mind is no longer </div>
<div id="ta_68" class="t s1_68">there, hence there is never any frustration. </div>
<div id="tb_68" class="t s1_68">QUIETLY CONSIDER WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG. But in the English </div>
<div id="tc_68" class="t s1_68">translation it becomes just the opposite. If you simply cling to the English words it </div>
<div id="td_68" class="t s1_68">means think, ponder, consider, what is right and what is wrong. </div>
<div id="te_68" class="t s1_68">RECEIVING ALL OPINIONS EQUALLY, WITHOUT HASTE, WISELY, OBSERVE THE </div>
<div id="tf_68" class="t s1_68">LAW. Buddha says: Don't have any prejudice. And we are so full of prejudices, we are </div>
<div id="tg_68" class="t s1_68">bundles of prejudices. And whenever we think that we have come to a conclusion, it is </div>
<div id="th_68" class="t s1_68">just a deception -- you have again come to a prejudice which has already been put </div>
<div id="ti_68" class="t s1_68">inside you by the society, by the church, by the state. You are victims of so many vested </div>
<div id="tj_68" class="t s1_68">interests, which are all sitting around you with greedy eyes to exploit you, to suck your </div>

<div id="tl_68" class="t s1_68">Watch, the next time you feel that you have understood something, observed </div>

<div id="tn_68" class="t s1_68">a new form, in a new format, with new words? And you will be surprised: it is so. </div>
<div id="to_68" class="t s1_68">The head doctor at the hospital was making his rounds and he passed before a group of </div>

<div id="tr_68" class="t s1_68">The nurse said, "He is one of those artificial insemination babies, and I am afraid he has </div>

<div id="tt_68" class="t s1_68">"Confirms a pet theory of mine," said the doctor. "Spare the rod and spoil the child!" </div>

<div id="tw_68" class="t s1_68">them. </div>
<div id="tx_68" class="t s1_68">And that's what your great scholars go on doing. They cannot convince anybody, but </div>
<div id="ty_68" class="t s1_68">they can certainly confuse. They have confused the whole world. That's what your </div>
<div id="tz_68" class="t s1_68">theologians have done, your priests have done. The world lives in such confusion </div>
<div id="t10_68" class="t s1_68">because of these great scholars, priests, professors, philosophers, pundits; and they have </div>

<div id="t12_68" class="t s1_68">they are saying, but when they become capable of confusing you they enjoy the ego trip. </div>
<div id="t13_68" class="t s1_68">It is very satisfying to confuse somebody because you become superior. And there are </div>
<div id="t14_68" class="t s1_68">always foolish people who are ready to become victims of words -- beautiful, fine </div>
<div id="t15_68" class="t s1_68">words. And systems made of words are nothing but houses made out of playing cards. </div>
