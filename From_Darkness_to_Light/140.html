<div id="t2_140" class="t s2_140">Buddha looked at him, closed his eyes and remained silent. The man also closed his eyes. They</div>
<div id="t3_140" class="t s2_140">sat in silence for half an hour; then the man touched Buddha’s feet and said, ”Thank you for your</div>
<div id="t4_140" class="t s2_140">answer,” and went away.</div>
<div id="t5_140" class="t s2_140">Now, it was too much. Everybody gone – the time was passing so slowly and Ananda was boiling;</div>
<div id="t6_140" class="t s2_140">and when everybody was gone, he simply jumped up. He said, ”This is too much! You should take</div>
<div id="t7_140" class="t s2_140">care, at least, of us poor people too. Those three persons don’t know all the three answers, they</div>
<div id="t8_140" class="t s2_140">only know one answer. But we are with you, we have heard all the three answers. You should think</div>
<div id="t9_140" class="t s2_140">of us too, we have been going crazy. If this is going to go on, what will happen to us?”</div>
<div id="ta_140" class="t s2_140">Buddha said, ”You should remember one thing.</div>
<div id="tb_140" class="t s2_140">First, those questions were not your questions,</div>
<div id="tc_140" class="t s2_140">those answers were not given to you. Why should you jump into it? It is none of your business. It</div>
<div id="td_140" class="t s2_140">was something between me and those three people.”</div>
<div id="te_140" class="t s2_140">Ananda said, ”That I can understand. It is not my question, and you have not answered me. But I</div>
<div id="tf_140" class="t s2_140">have ears and I can hear; I heard the question, I heard the answer. And all the three answers are</div>
<div id="tg_140" class="t s2_140">contradiction upon contradiction. First you say yes, then you say no; and then you remain silent, you</div>
<div id="th_140" class="t s2_140">don’t say anything. And that great guy touched your feet and said, ‘Thank you for your answer.’ And</div>
<div id="ti_140" class="t s2_140">we are sitting there and there has been no answer at all!”</div>
<div id="tj_140" class="t s2_140">Buddha said, ”You think about life in terms of absolutes, that’s your trouble. Life is relative. To that</div>
<div id="tk_140" class="t s2_140">man, the answer was yes; it was relative to him, related to the implications of his questions, his</div>
<div id="tl_140" class="t s2_140">being, his life. That man to whom I said yes was an atheist; he does not believe in God, and I do not</div>
<div id="tm_140" class="t s2_140">want to support his stupid atheism. He goes on proclaiming there is no God. Even if a small space</div>
<div id="tn_140" class="t s2_140">is left unexplored ... perhaps in that space God exists. You can say with absoluteness there is no</div>
<div id="to_140" class="t s2_140">God when you have explored all existence. That is possible only in ultimate samadhi.</div>
<div id="tp_140" class="t s2_140">”And that man was simply believing that there was no God – he had no existential experience of</div>
<div id="tq_140" class="t s2_140">there being no God. I had to shatter him, I had to bring him down to earth. I had to hit him hard</div>
<div id="tr_140" class="t s2_140">on the head. My yes was relative to that person, to his whole personality. His question was not just</div>
<div id="ts_140" class="t s2_140">words. The same question from somebody else may have received another answer.</div>
<div id="tt_140" class="t s2_140">And that’s what happened when I said to the other person, no. The question was the same, the</div>
<div id="tu_140" class="t s2_140">words were the same – but the man behind those words was different. So the relationship between</div>
<div id="tv_140" class="t s2_140">the words and the implications had changed. It is relative. The second man was as much an idiot</div>
<div id="tw_140" class="t s2_140">as was the ﬁrst, but on the opposite pole: he believed there is God. And he had come to get my</div>
<div id="tx_140" class="t s2_140">support for his belief. I don’t support anybody’s belief because belief as such is the barrier. It does</div>
<div id="ty_140" class="t s2_140">not matter what belief it is, true or false. No belief is true, no belief is false; all beliefs are simply</div>
<div id="tz_140" class="t s2_140">idiotic. I had to say to that man, no.</div>
<div id="t10_140" class="t s2_140">”And the third man had come with no belief. He had not asked me, ‘Is there a God?’ No, he had</div>
<div id="t11_140" class="t s2_140">come with an open heart, with no mind, no belief, no ideology. He was really a sane man, intelligent.</div>
<div id="t12_140" class="t s2_140">He asked me, ‘Would you say something about God?’ He was not in search of somebody’s support</div>
<div id="t13_140" class="t s2_140">for his belief system, he was not in search of a faith, he was not asking with a prejudiced mind. And</div>
<div id="t14_140" class="t s2_140">he was asking about my experience: ‘Would you say something about God?’</div>
<div id="t15_140" class="t s2_140">”I could see that this man has no belief, this way or that; he is innocent. With such an innocent</div>
