<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">He said, "I'm not joking. The tent IS on fire." And people clapped more and laughed </div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">more. The clown was at a loss as to what to do! He started beating his chest and saying, </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">"Believe me! THE TENT IS ON FIRE, YOU ARE IN DANGER!" </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">But nobody believed him; people continued laughing. And many were burned. </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">This is not a parable: this is reality. Buddhas have been calling to you that the world is </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">on fire, but you think they may be just taking things too seriously. </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">"My beautiful foxy lady," whispered the suave dude, "you are the only chick for me. I </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">dig you, I am crazy about you, I am nuts about you. I can't make it through the night </div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s1_9">without your love." </div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">"Hey, wait a minute," protested the bashful girl. "I don't want to get serious." </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">"Hell, baby," he queried, "who's serious?" </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">Nobody seems to be serious. Everybody is clowning, everybody is laughing -- or at least </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">pretending to laugh, at least pretending to be happy, at least bragging about his </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">pleasures, the joys of life, and maybe not only deceiving others but being deceived by </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">his own bragging. One may start believing in one's own lies: then they start appearing </div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s1_9">almost like truths. </div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s1_9">Buddha is saying: ARE YOU LAUGHING? AND THE WORLD IS ON FIRE! </div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s1_9">Certainly it shows only one thing: </div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s1_9">YOU ARE DEEP IN THE DARK. </div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s1_9">WILL YOU NOT ASK FOR LIGHT? </div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s1_9">This is ancient language. Now, since Sigmund Freud, we can translate darkness as </div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s1_9">unconsciousness and light as consciousness. That will be easier to understand, because </div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s1_9">when you talk about darkness and light it looks poetic, and Buddha is very scientific </div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s1_9">though he is full of poetry. But his poetry is not mere poetry, it has a great science in it, </div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s1_9">great alchemy in it. His poetry is because of his experience, but his poetry is not just to </div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s1_9">entertain you. His poetry is out of his grace, his very being is poetic, but his message is </div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s1_9">scientific, as scientific as it can be. He is talking about the unconscious and the </div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s1_9">conscious. </div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">He says you are deep in the dark if you are not aware that the world is on fire, that </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">people are living in anguish -- and they may not even be aware of it. That way the </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">anguish is doubled or multiplied, because if you are aware of your anguish you can get </div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s1_9">out of it. When the house is on fire and you are asleep, the danger is far more. If the </div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s1_9">house is on fire and you are awake, the danger is far less -- you can escape, you can get </div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s1_9">out of the house. Neighbors can help you to come out, you can make a phone call to the </div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s1_9">fire department. You can do something! At least you can jump out of the window. But if </div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s1_9">you are asleep then things are more difficult. </div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s1_9">YOU ARE DEEP IN THE DARK. Buddha says: Looking at you it seems you are not </div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s1_9">conscious at all, you are living an unconscious life. Now it is a psychological truth. The </div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s1_9">whole contemporary psychology, whether Freudian or non-Freudian, Adlerian or </div>
