<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">say that you have not found, that you are in an illusion, that you have been hypnotized, </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">that you are hallucinating, that you have been drugged. That gives them a consolation, </div>

<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">from London to a faraway place somewhere in the Caucasus. It was very difficult. </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">Financially Ouspensky was bankrupt. He had no money, no house to live in, nobody to </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">support him. And such a long journey! And the times were very dangerous. In those </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">parts of the world it was dangerous to move, because the Russian revolution was </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">happening. People were being massacred, killed, murdered. There was no peace. Even </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">Gurdjieff had to leave Russia, and he was hiding in the mountains of the Caucasus. </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">It was not a right time to go there; it was very dangerous. The journey was not easy: all </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">the trains were unsettled, roads were cut, bridges were broken. It was chaos! But when </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">the master calls, the disciple has to follow. Whatever belongings he had, he sold. He </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">borrowed money from people, and traveled thousands of miles. It took him almost </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">thirty days to reach Gurdjieff. Tired, tattered, thinking many times, "What am I doing? </div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s1_51">People are escaping from Russia, and I am going there!" And he was on the blacklist of </div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s1_51">the communists, because he was a well-known figure -- chief disciple of George </div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s1_51">Gurdjieff, a well-known, world-famous mathematician, a great author, one of the </div>

<div id="t11_51" class="t s1_51">languages of the world. Going back to Russia was dangerous. He could be caught, </div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s1_51">imprisoned, killed. He was anticommunist! -- no sensible person can be a communist, </div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s1_51">because the whole idea is nonsense. But he traveled...and when he reached Gurdjieff, </div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s1_51">Gurdjieff looked at him and the first thing that he said was, "Go back to London and </div>
