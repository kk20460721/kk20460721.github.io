<div id="t3_37" class="t s1_37">sing a song for you or dance a dance or write a poem or paint a picture or tell you a story. </div>
<div id="t4_37" class="t s1_37">For all these the throat center is again used as a center to give. The meeting of receiving </div>

<div id="t8_37" class="t s1_37">you never become rich by receiving. You become rich by giving. In fact you possess only </div>
<div id="t9_37" class="t s1_37">that which you can give. If you cannot give it, you simply believe that you possess. You </div>

<div id="tj_37" class="t s1_37">not free. Even beggars are more free than they. What has happened to them? They have </div>
<div id="tk_37" class="t s1_37">used their throat center just to receive. Not only that they have not used their throat center </div>
<div id="tl_37" class="t s1_37">to give, they have not even moved to the second Freudian center, anal. These people are </div>
