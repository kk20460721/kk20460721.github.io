<div id="t1_200" class="t s1_200">People had heard about a Sufi mystic and they said, "In your kingdom there is a Sufi</div>
<div id="t2_200" class="t s1_200">mystic, a very strange fellow. He has helped many people, although you have to be a little</div>
<div id="t3_200" class="t s1_200">alert with him because he is not predictable, he may do anything. But one thing is certain:</div>
<div id="t4_200" class="t s1_200">whatever he does, finally you find that it had a reason. In the beginning it will look absolutely</div>
<div id="t5_200" class="t s1_200">irrational. If you have courage enough you can go."</div>
<div id="t6_200" class="t s1_200">The king said, "Do you think me a coward? I have invaded great lands; my whole life has</div>
<div id="t7_200" class="t s1_200">been the life of a warrior. Can a poor Sufi mystic make me afraid? I will go ... and I will go</div>
<div id="t8_200" class="t s1_200">alone, no bodyguards, no army, no advisers."</div>
<div id="t9_200" class="t s1_200">But he took with him a big bag full of diamonds and rubies and emeralds, just to show to</div>
<div id="ta_200" class="t s1_200">the Sufi mystic: "This is only a sample. I have so much money but it is not helping me at all.</div>
<div id="tb_200" class="t s1_200">First I used to think that when I have money I will relax and enjoy. But now money is there</div>
<div id="tc_200" class="t s1_200">and I'm living in hell."</div>
<div id="td_200" class="t s1_200">The Sufi mystic was sitting under a tree. The king went there, got down from his horse,</div>
<div id="te_200" class="t s1_200">touched the feet of the Sufi mystic and asked him, "Can you help me?"</div>
<div id="tf_200" class="t s1_200">The Sufi mystic said, "What do you want? I will help you immediately."</div>
<div id="tg_200" class="t s1_200">He had heard that this man was strange -- otherwise nobody would tell you, "I will help</div>
<div id="th_200" class="t s1_200">you immediately." He is going to do something ... The king was a little afraid: nobody wants</div>
<div id="ti_200" class="t s1_200">to be helped immediately. He said, "There is no hurry, but ..."</div>
<div id="tj_200" class="t s1_200">The Sufi mystic said, "Just tell me what you want. Don't waste my time. You say it; I will</div>
<div id="tk_200" class="t s1_200">give it to you and be finished."</div>
<div id="tl_200" class="t s1_200">The king said, "You don't understand. I want peace of mind."</div>
<div id="tm_200" class="t s1_200">And when he was saying "peace of mind," the Sufi mystic took his bag of emeralds and</div>
<div id="tn_200" class="t s1_200">diamonds and rubies and ran away. The king said, "My God, what kind of man is he? Is he a</div>
<div id="to_200" class="t s1_200">mystic or a thief?"</div>
<div id="tp_200" class="t s1_200">He ran -- in his whole life he had never run. The village was unknown to him, with small</div>
<div id="tq_200" class="t s1_200">streets. The Sufi was perfectly well known; he lived in that village. The king was shouting,</div>
<div id="tr_200" class="t s1_200">"Catch hold of that thief" -- and people were laughing, because people knew that every day</div>
<div id="ts_200" class="t s1_200">something or other happens. And it was really a laughing matter: the king was huffing and</div>
<div id="tt_200" class="t s1_200">puffing and shouting, "Catch him! Why are you just laughing?" -- and still running because</div>
<div id="tu_200" class="t s1_200">that old fellow is taking away all his money and he is going so fast.</div>
<div id="tv_200" class="t s1_200">The Sufi mystic gave him a good round of the whole village, made the whole village</div>
<div id="tw_200" class="t s1_200">aware that the mystic is ahead and the king is following, perspiring. Finally he reached to the</div>
<div id="tx_200" class="t s1_200">same tree, sat there, and waited for the king to come. The king came very tired, perspiring, and</div>
<div id="ty_200" class="t s1_200">the mystic gave him the bag. He took the bag, put it on his chest and said, "My God!"</div>
<div id="tz_200" class="t s1_200">The Sufi said, "Have you got some peace of mind? Had not I told you I would help you</div>
<div id="t10_200" class="t s1_200">immediately?"</div>
<div id="t11_200" class="t s1_200">The king said, "Strange is your way ... but it is true, I am feeling very peaceful, as I have</div>
<div id="t12_200" class="t s1_200">never felt in my life. And the trouble is that this money was always with me, and I never felt</div>
<div id="t13_200" class="t s1_200">so happy as I am feeling now."</div>
<div id="t14_200" class="t s1_200">The Sufi said, "I have solved your problem. Your problem is that you have got everything.</div>
<div id="t15_200" class="t s1_200">You need some distance, you need to lose it; only then will you understand what you had. And</div>
<div id="t16_200" class="t s1_200">this is not only true about your money. This is more true about your life itself: because you</div>
