<div id="t1_361" class="t s1_361">CHAPTER 34. TO RELATE WITH NON-SANNYASINS IS BOUND TO BE DIFFICULT</div>
<div id="t2_361" class="t s2_361">One of his friends took pity on van Gogh and asked him to stay with him until he got some</div>
<div id="t3_361" class="t s2_361">employment. And he fell in love with the sister of the friend – just love at ﬁrst sight. The ﬁrst day in the</div>
<div id="t4_361" class="t s2_361">house of the friend, he proposed to the girl. The girl simply laughed; they were more comfortably-off</div>
<div id="t5_361" class="t s2_361">people – better educated, middle class, higher than Vincent van Gogh and his family.</div>
<div id="t6_361" class="t s2_361">She could not believe that this poor beggar could even dare to ask her. Jokingly, she said, ”Can you</div>
<div id="t7_361" class="t s2_361">give me any proof of your love? Can you put your hand on this candle?” – it was burning by their</div>
<div id="t8_361" class="t s2_361">side.</div>
<div id="t9_361" class="t s2_361">He said, ”Yes!” and he kept his hand on the burning candle. His whole hand was burnt. The woman</div>
<div id="ta_361" class="t s2_361">got frightened: this man seems to be mad also! She pulled his hand away, but he said, ”Why are</div>
<div id="tb_361" class="t s2_361">you pulling it away? Let me keep it there until you say yes.”</div>
<div id="tc_361" class="t s2_361">The whole family gathered there. They pulled him away from the candle – he had burned his hand</div>
<div id="td_361" class="t s2_361">for his whole life – and he was turned out of the house the next day.</div>
<div id="te_361" class="t s2_361">A man of great sensitivity – but no woman was ready to love him, because he looked crazy. Nobody</div>
<div id="tf_361" class="t s2_361">was buying his paintings, and still he went on painting. His brother was employed – his younger</div>
<div id="tg_361" class="t s2_361">brother – and was sending van Gogh the exact amount of money so that he could have his food</div>
<div id="th_361" class="t s2_361">every day. Each week he would send money – enough for one week only. And Vincent van Gogh</div>
<div id="ti_361" class="t s2_361">would only eat four days in the week, and three days he would fast and purchase canvases and</div>
<div id="tj_361" class="t s2_361">paints.</div>
<div id="tk_361" class="t s2_361">And nobody was buying his paintings.</div>
<div id="tl_361" class="t s2_361">People were simply laughing and saying, ”He is</div>
<div id="tm_361" class="t s2_361">simply mad! We have never seen such paintings. What is he doing?”</div>
<div id="tn_361" class="t s2_361">But it seems whatever he was doing is going to come true, slowly, slowly. If his vision of stars is now</div>
<div id="to_361" class="t s2_361">conﬁrmed by physics, it is simply a miracle that with bare eyes, he could see that they are spirals.</div>
<div id="tp_361" class="t s2_361">Nobody in the whole of history has even thought about it, so you cannot think that he borrowed</div>
<div id="tq_361" class="t s2_361">the thought from somebody. Nobody has seen stars like that. And he could not prove anything; he</div>
<div id="tr_361" class="t s2_361">simply went on saying, ”This is how I see them.” But everybody laughed, because they also could</div>
<div id="ts_361" class="t s2_361">see the stars but they didn’t see spirals.</div>
<div id="tt_361" class="t s2_361">This tremendous sensitivity... but he was misunderstood everywhere. And ﬁnally. when he was only</div>
<div id="tu_361" class="t s2_361">thirty-three, they drove him mad. Hungry, starving, and everybody laughing and condemning... not</div>
<div id="tv_361" class="t s2_361">a single painting was sold. His brother tried to send a man with money and said, ”At least purchase</div>
<div id="tw_361" class="t s2_361">one painting. He will have the consolation that somebody has purchased one painting.”</div>
<div id="tx_361" class="t s2_361">The man went – he had no idea about painting. Van Gogh was so ecstatic that somebody had come</div>
<div id="ty_361" class="t s2_361">ﬁnally to purchase a painting – so he was showing him all his paintings. And the man said, ”Don’t</div>
<div id="tz_361" class="t s2_361">waste my time – any will do. This is the money.”</div>
<div id="t10_361" class="t s2_361">You can understand how much van Gogh would have been shocked. He simply said, ”That means</div>
<div id="t11_361" class="t s2_361">this money has been given to you by my brother – because you are not even looking at the paintings.</div>
<div id="t12_361" class="t s2_361">I cannot sell any painting to you. These paintings are not for people who cannot understand them.</div>
<div id="t13_361" class="t s2_361">And just tell my brother never to do such a thing to me – it hurts more.” And it was found actually</div>
<div id="t14_361" class="t s2_361">that that was the case.</div>
<div id="t15_361" class="t s2_361">Van Gogh died without selling a single painting. Now only two hundred paintings have survived, and</div>
<div id="t16_361" class="t s2_361">each painting is worth not less that one million dollars; each painting has a certain quality that has</div>
<div id="t17_361" class="t s2_361">never been found in any other painting.</div>
<div id="t18_361" class="t s2_361">Light on the Path</div>
<div id="t19_361" class="t s2_361">361</div>
