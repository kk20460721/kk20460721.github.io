<div id="t2_162" class="t s1_162">Hindus or Jews, that's all. If a Jewish child is taken away from his home and is brought </div>
<div id="t3_162" class="t s1_162">up by Hindus he will never come to know, never will dream that he is a Jew. Although </div>
<div id="t4_162" class="t s1_162">born of Jewish parents he will never become aware of it -- unless he is told. He will </div>
<div id="t5_162" class="t s1_162">think that he is a Hindu. He may even fight for Hinduism with a Jew, he may kill a Jew </div>
<div id="t6_162" class="t s1_162">for the sake of Hinduism, not knowing at all that he himself is a Jew. </div>
<div id="t7_162" class="t s1_162">Now in India there are millions of Christians. They think they are Christians, but they </div>
<div id="t8_162" class="t s1_162">have always lived here; their parents were Hindus, their parents' parents were Hindus. </div>
<div id="t9_162" class="t s1_162">For centuries they have been Hindus! Now they have been bribed, persuaded, </div>
<div id="ta_162" class="t s1_162">convinced, converted, and they have become Christians. They can kill Hindus; if the </div>
<div id="tb_162" class="t s1_162">need arises they can fight. </div>
<div id="tc_162" class="t s1_162">There are millions of Mohammedans in India; they have all been converted forcibly. At </div>
<div id="td_162" class="t s1_162">least Christians have been persuaded sophisticatedly -- but millions of Hindus have </div>
<div id="te_162" class="t s1_162">been forced at the point of daggers. The choice was: "You can live as a Mohammedan or </div>
<div id="tf_162" class="t s1_162">you have to die." And who wants to die? Lust for life is so deep that it is better to live, </div>
<div id="tg_162" class="t s1_162">even if you have to live as a Mohammedan it's okay. Now those millions of </div>
<div id="th_162" class="t s1_162">Mohammedans who live in India basically have the blood of Hindus. But they can kill </div>
<div id="ti_162" class="t s1_162">Hindus -- they have been killing -- and they are being killed by Hindus. Hindus are </div>
<div id="tj_162" class="t s1_162">killing their own children; now they are called Mohammedans. Just change the label... </div>
<div id="tk_162" class="t s1_162">and such a great change happens just by changing the label. </div>
<div id="tl_162" class="t s1_162">When you ask, "Who am I?" you will come across that point. You will see that you are </div>
<div id="tm_162" class="t s1_162">neither a Mohammedan nor a Hindu nor a Christian; these are accidents of birth, </div>
<div id="tn_162" class="t s1_162">upbringing. If you have been born in Russia you would not have been either Hindu, </div>

<div id="tp_162" class="t s1_162">communist -- just as you are a practicing Catholic now. You would have denied God, </div>
<div id="tq_162" class="t s1_162">you would have denied prayer, you would have denied the whole religion -- because </div>
<div id="tr_162" class="t s1_162">the state is powerful, and nobody wants to go against the state; it is dangerous. </div>

<div id="tv_162" class="t s1_162">his own will; the state decides everything. If the state says, "This is so," this is so. You </div>

<div id="tx_162" class="t s1_162">imprisonment or sent to Siberia or you may be simply killed. Or, even more dangerous, </div>

<div id="t11_162" class="t s1_162">insane, you are insane. There is no way to fight with them. </div>
<div id="t12_162" class="t s1_162">Mulla Nasruddin was dying, on his deathbed, almost in a coma. The doctor came to see </div>
<div id="t13_162" class="t s1_162">him. The doctor was drunk; he took his pulse but could not find any pulse because he </div>
<div id="t14_162" class="t s1_162">was holding the hand in the wrong way. He looked at Nasruddin's face and said to his </div>

<div id="t16_162" class="t s1_162">At that very moment, Nasruddin opened his eyes and said, "What! I am alive!" </div>
