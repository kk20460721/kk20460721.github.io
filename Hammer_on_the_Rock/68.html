<div id="t2_68" class="t s2_68">12</div>
<div id="t3_68" class="t s3_68">26 December 1975 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</div>
<div id="t4_68" class="t s4_68">[A sannyasin, looking close to tears as he talked, told Osho that he was feeling very sad and was</div>
<div id="t5_68" class="t s4_68">easily hurt, and had felt like this for several weeks but he was unable to say what he felt was the</div>
<div id="t6_68" class="t s4_68">reason for this.</div>
<div id="t7_68" class="t s4_68">Osho asked his wife, who was also present, if she could comment, as her husband was not very</div>
<div id="t8_68" class="t s4_68">clear about what was happening. Osho said that perhaps, unconsciously, he was avoiding facing</div>
<div id="t9_68" class="t s4_68">up to the problem for fear that he would not be able to cope with it. He added that women are more</div>
<div id="ta_68" class="t s4_68">perceptive than men about things pertaining to relationships, so perhaps she could be helpful.</div>
<div id="tb_68" class="t s4_68">She said that she was feeling a need to be alone lately – a feeling which was new to her – and that</div>
<div id="tc_68" class="t s4_68">she thought this might be upsetting her husband, adding that she felt distant from him and wanted</div>
<div id="td_68" class="t s4_68">to have her own; space. She said she used to cling to him a lot before.</div>
<div id="te_68" class="t s4_68">Her husband said he felt rejected, ’wiped out’, but did not seem to see a connection between these</div>
<div id="tf_68" class="t s4_68">feelings and his wife’s desire be alone.]</div>
<div id="tg_68" class="t s4_68">Now I understand exactly what the problem is.</div>
<div id="th_68" class="t s4_68">(to the husband) Because [your wife] has been</div>
<div id="ti_68" class="t s4_68">always afraid of being alone, she was clinging to you and you enjoyed it, the ego enjoyed it. The</div>
<div id="tj_68" class="t s4_68">male ego enjoys it very much when a woman goes on clinging. A woman is like a creeper, and the</div>
<div id="tk_68" class="t s4_68">tree enjoys it tremendously – that the woman is dependent, mm? She was afraid of her aloneness,</div>
<div id="tl_68" class="t s4_68">that’s why she was clinging to you. Now, the more meditative she will become, the more she will like</div>
<div id="tm_68" class="t s4_68">to be alone – because that is the only way she can get rid of her fear. So she wants to be alone, to</div>
<div id="tn_68" class="t s4_68">be left alone, and you feel as if you are not needed, rejected. But you are not rejected at all, and it</div>
<div id="to_68" class="t s4_68">is not that you are not needed.</div>
<div id="tp_68" class="t s4_68">In fact she is trying to stand on her own feet for the ﬁrst time, and if you allow her and help her to</div>
<div id="tq_68" class="t s4_68">stand on her own, only then will love be possible. Up to now it has not been love. She was clinging</div>
