<div id="t1_144" class="t s1_144">CHAPTER 11. THE IMAGE OF THE ETERNAL AND THE FORMLESS, THE ANCIENT AND THE VOID</div>
<div id="t2_144" class="t s2_144">for it is deeper than these. That which does not manifest itself even in the light of the sun, and that</div>
<div id="t3_144" class="t s2_144">which does not set with the setting of the sun – that alone is. That which is not when the ﬂower is,</div>
<div id="t4_144" class="t s2_144">and that which is not extinct when the ﬂower is not – that alone is. That which is not born at birth</div>
<div id="t5_144" class="t s2_144">and that which does not die at death – that alone is.</div>
<div id="t6_144" class="t s2_144">When a person is born, the ﬁrst boundary line is drawn. A certain person Rama is born. We draw a</div>
<div id="t7_144" class="t s2_144">line: he was born on such and such a day. Then this man dies. We draw another line: he died on</div>
<div id="t8_144" class="t s2_144">such and such a day. This is the boundary within which the individual, Rama exists. But it is not the</div>
<div id="t9_144" class="t s2_144">boundary of existence. Let us go a little deeper and perhaps we will understand.</div>
<div id="ta_144" class="t s2_144">Which day do you call your birthday? This is a debatable question. Is it the day you were born, or is</div>
<div id="tb_144" class="t s2_144">it the day you were conceived in your mother’s womb? Generally, the day the child is born is looked</div>
<div id="tc_144" class="t s2_144">upon as the birthday. Then what should we call the day when conception takes place? We can go</div>
<div id="td_144" class="t s2_144">back a little and say the birth takes place on the day of conception.</div>
<div id="te_144" class="t s2_144">Let us go still deeper. One half of the embryo was present in the mother long before conception</div>
<div id="tf_144" class="t s2_144">and the other half in the father long before conception. The beginning of birth, according lo science,</div>
<div id="tg_144" class="t s2_144">took place on their meeting. So this happening of birth is the meeting of two lives that were already</div>
<div id="th_144" class="t s2_144">existing. This, then, is not the beginning, for both the lives were already present: one was hidden in</div>
<div id="ti_144" class="t s2_144">the father and one in the mother. Their union brought a new life into being. This is the beginning of</div>
<div id="tj_144" class="t s2_144">the life of an individual, say Rama. But this is not the beginning of his existence, for his existence lay</div>
<div id="tk_144" class="t s2_144">hidden within his father and mother – it was present and fully alive. It manifested itself in the union</div>
<div id="tl_144" class="t s2_144">of his father and mother.</div>
<div id="tm_144" class="t s2_144">Let us go back even further. That which was hidden within the father was hidden within the parents</div>
<div id="tn_144" class="t s2_144">of the father. What was hidden in the mother was hidden within the parents of the mother. And so</div>
<div id="to_144" class="t s2_144">we go back, and further back. Then the question arises: when did this life actually start? When you</div>
<div id="tp_144" class="t s2_144">were born is your birth, but the life within you was not born with you. If we go further and further</div>
<div id="tq_144" class="t s2_144">back, all the past history of the world, all the known and unknown, will be exhausted; and yet the</div>
<div id="tr_144" class="t s2_144">mystery will remain unsolved. You were alive within the ﬁrst man that was on earth. But how did he</div>
<div id="ts_144" class="t s2_144">come to be? For him to be, it is imperative that existence must have been before him.</div>
<div id="tt_144" class="t s2_144">So existence is a continuation. Birth is a simple happening, according to science, but rather complex</div>
<div id="tu_144" class="t s2_144">according to religion.</div>
<div id="tv_144" class="t s2_144">The nucleus formed by the union of the mother and father is merely the</div>
<div id="tw_144" class="t s2_144">beginning of the body. The soul enters this body.</div>
<div id="tx_144" class="t s2_144">Therefore, when Buddha’s father told him that he had given birth to him and he was his father, he</div>
<div id="ty_144" class="t s2_144">replied, ”I was born through you, but you have not given birth to me. I came through you, you were</div>
<div id="tz_144" class="t s2_144">the door through which I entered, but you have not created me. I was, even when you were not. You</div>
<div id="t10_144" class="t s2_144">provided a passage for me and I appeared, but my journey was very different from yours”.</div>
<div id="t11_144" class="t s2_144">His father was displeased with him, because Buddha was going about begging in the very country</div>
<div id="t12_144" class="t s2_144">of which he was the king. His father tried to reason with him. He said, ”Siddhartha, no one in our</div>
<div id="t13_144" class="t s2_144">family has ever begged.”</div>
<div id="t14_144" class="t s2_144">Buddha replied. ”I know nothing about your family but as far as I remember my past journeys, I have</div>
<div id="t15_144" class="t s2_144">always been a beggar. In the life before, and in those preceding it, I have always begged. I am a</div>
<div id="t16_144" class="t s2_144">very ancient beggar. About you, I know nothing”.</div>
<div id="t17_144" class="t s2_144">The Way of Tao, Volume 2</div>
<div id="t18_144" class="t s2_144">144</div>
<div id="t19_144" class="t s3_144">Osho</div>
