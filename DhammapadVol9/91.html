<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">WHILE IT IS IN TOTAL ECLIPSE. I THOUGHT YOU BELIEVED IN ABSOLUTE </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">FREEDOM. </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">Sunderam, you are not the only one to ask this question. At least twenty other fools </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">have also asked the same. Please forgive me that I told you not to look at the sun </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">directly -- do it! Please do me a favor! I was utterly wrong to say it so -- your freedom is </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">destroyed. Enjoy your freedom; at least today, don't forget to enjoy it. Look as much as </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">you can at the sun and don't use any device -- because that will hinder your freedom. </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">With the naked eyes -- natural eyes -- look at the sun. Enjoy it to your heart's content. </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">I was not going to say it to you. The whole blame goes to Vivek! She nagged me and </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">nagged me to tell you; otherwise I was not going to tell you anything. </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">A few of these twenty fools have said, "We had never thought that you are </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">superstitious." This is not superstition -- these are scientific facts. There are millions of </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">superstitions also. For example, in India, after the eclipse is over then take a bath and if </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">you can take the bath in a holy river like the Ganges it is thought to be very religious, </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">holy -- because Indians believe that the sun has been in deep difficulty and it is out of </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">the difficulty. That is superstition. The sun is not going into any difficulty at all. The </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">eclipse is not happening on the sun; the sun has nothing to do with the eclipse. It is just </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">the moon coming between you and the sun; it is not happening on the moon either. It is </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">only happening for us. </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">Indians give donations after the eclipse is over, rejoicing that the sun god is out of </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">trouble. Those are superstitions. </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">But looking at the sun is dangerous -- scientifically dangerous; it is not a question of </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">superstition. You can try it. A few of the others have written, "How can we believe in </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">what you say when your date was wrong, your day was wrong?" That is true. Even if </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">my date is wrong and my day is wrong, the sun in eclipse will have the same effect. </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">About days and dates I am not so sure. In fact, I have no idea of time. I have to go on </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">looking at the clock again and again, otherwise I will go on talking and talking. </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">Just last month it happened: the clock stopped... at eight twenty it stopped. I looked at it </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">again and again... it was ten to ten. And I am so superstitious that I still believed the </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">clock! I was still thinking it was eight twenty. Finally I started seeing some restlessness </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">around me. I thought, "What is the matter? Something somewhere is wrong." I looked </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">at the clock -- again eight twenty. I said, "There is no problem; there is still time </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">enough." </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">Yes, on the fourteenth I said, "Tomorrow." Naturally, my date was wrong, but that does </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">not mean that what I said is wrong. Fifteenth or sixteenth, that doesn't matter; dates are </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">arbitrary. They are just our creation -- days are arbitrary. But just because of that, if you </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">ask me how you can believe</div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">....</div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s1_91">I am not telling you to believe anything. You can go and check with the scientists -- it is </div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">dangerous to the eyes, and sometimes so dangerous that the blindness that will be </div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s1_91">caused by it will be incurable. </div>
