<div id="t2_7" class="t s1_7">could have become a boat becomes the cause of your drowning. </div>
<div id="t3_7" class="t s1_7">Religion is concerned basically with helping you to bring your potential into action, to </div>
<div id="t4_7" class="t s1_7">make your potential actual, so it is not just there as a seed but becomes a flower and a </div>
<div id="t5_7" class="t s1_7">great fragrance is released. </div>
<div id="t6_7" class="t s1_7">That's what happened to Gautama the Buddha, that's what happened to Jesus the </div>
<div id="t7_7" class="t s1_7">Christ. These few people were just like you, made of the same stuff. There is nothing </div>
<div id="t8_7" class="t s1_7">special about them, they are not special beings. Forget that idea. The priests have been </div>
<div id="t9_7" class="t s1_7">preaching it down the ages -- that they were special, that Jesus was the only begotten </div>
<div id="ta_7" class="t s1_7">Son of God. It is all sheer nonsense. You are as much a son of God as Jesus was, no more </div>
<div id="tb_7" class="t s1_7">or less -- no difference between you and Jesus. As far as the potential is concerned you </div>
<div id="tc_7" class="t s1_7">are absolutely alike. But Jesus actualized it and you have not even touched it, it is </div>
<div id="td_7" class="t s1_7">simply lying there. It is a treasure which has not been used, and anything which is not </div>
<div id="te_7" class="t s1_7">used for a long time goes dead, becomes stale. It goes rotten, it becomes a dead weight </div>
<div id="tf_7" class="t s1_7">on you, it makes you heavy and ill. </div>
<div id="tg_7" class="t s1_7">Buddha has nothing special in him. Of course, the Buddhist priests say that he is </div>
<div id="th_7" class="t s1_7">special. Why do these priests go on saying that Buddha is special, Mahavira is special, </div>
<div id="ti_7" class="t s1_7">Jesus is special, Krishna is special? Why? -- for a simple reason: that helps to protect our </div>
<div id="tj_7" class="t s1_7">egos. They are special, what can we do? If they became enlightened they were bound to </div>
<div id="tk_7" class="t s1_7">become enlightened, they came with a special capability. We are normal human beings, </div>
<div id="tl_7" class="t s1_7">they were AVATARAS. They were direct descendants of God, we are very very </div>
<div id="tm_7" class="t s1_7">faraway, distant relatives, and the distance is so much that it is impossible to bridge it. </div>
<div id="tn_7" class="t s1_7">They were coming directly from the above; they were messengers of God, messiahs, </div>
<div id="to_7" class="t s1_7">prophets, TIRTHANKARAS -- and we are ordinary people. This is a way of defending </div>
<div id="tp_7" class="t s1_7">our egos -- a very logical way, a very rational way. </div>
<div id="tq_7" class="t s1_7">Do you think you are paying respect by saying that Jesus is the only begotten Son of </div>
<div id="tr_7" class="t s1_7">God? You are not paying respect, you are being very cunning; you are trying to protect </div>
<div id="ts_7" class="t s1_7">yourself. You are saying, "You are special and we are ordinary, so we have to behave in </div>
<div id="tt_7" class="t s1_7">an ordinary way. You can behave like an enlightened person. What can we do about it? </div>
<div id="tu_7" class="t s1_7">We are made in this way. The responsibility is God's, not ours. It is not our fate to be a </div>

<div id="tw_7" class="t s1_7">They were destined and we are not destined. So if something happened to them it was </div>

<div id="ty_7" class="t s1_7">nothing is destined for us." </div>
<div id="tz_7" class="t s1_7">This is a trick, a strategy. Buddha wants you to be reminded that you are made of the </div>
<div id="t10_7" class="t s1_7">same stuff, the same blood, the same bones, the same marrow, the same consciousness. </div>
<div id="t11_7" class="t s1_7">The only difference is that you are not working on yourself, you are not using the </div>

<div id="t14_7" class="t s1_7">And we have to work in the world and we have to earn money and a livelihood." You </div>
