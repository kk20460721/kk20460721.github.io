<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">CHAPTER 3. FLIGHT FROM THE SHADOW</div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s2_40">One has to understand the logic of the mind. If you don’t understand you will be a victim of it. The</div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s2_40">mind has a vicious logic, it is a vicious circle – it is circular. If you listen to it, then every step will</div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s2_40">lead you more and more into the circle. This man is perfectly logical, you cannot ﬁnd any fault, any</div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s2_40">ﬂaw, in his logic. There is no loophole, he is as perfect a logician as any Aristotle. He says that if the</div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s2_40">shadow is following him it shows that he is not running fast enough. He must run faster and faster,</div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s2_40">then the moment will come when the shadow will not be able to follow him. But the shadow is yours,</div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s2_40">and the shadow is nobody. It is not somebody else following you; if it were, then the logic would</div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s2_40">have been right.</div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s2_40">Remember, when there is somebody else the mind is always right; when you are alone, the mind</div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s2_40">is always wrong. In society, with others, the mind is almost always right; with yourself, in isolation,</div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s2_40">the mind is always wrong. Why? Because mind is just an instrument to exist with others; it is just a</div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s2_40">technique to help you to be with others; it has nothing to do with yourself. Mind is needed because</div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s2_40">of society. If a child is born and he is not exposed to any society then the mind will not develop, there</div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s2_40">will be no mind. It has happened many times. It happened near Calcutta, thirty or forty years ago,</div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s2_40">that a girl was taken by wolves who took care of her, and she grew. She was fourteen when she</div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s2_40">was caught again by society. But she was just a wolf child; no human mind at all. She would run on</div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s2_40">all fours, and she was very dangerous, she needed to eat raw meat. And she was very strong, even</div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s2_40">eight strong men were not enough to control her. She had a wolf mind. She had to grow up with</div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s2_40">wolves, a society of wolves, so she had to grow a wolf-mind. It was impossible to train her to stand</div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s2_40">on two feet. She would try two or three steps, and again, she would fall down and be on all fours.</div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s2_40">But she could run so fast on all fours that nobody could follow her.</div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s2_40">Again, just ten years ago, a boy was found in Uttar Pradesh, near Lucknow.</div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s2_40">The same incident</div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s2_40">had happened – wolves seem to be very loving to children. They raised the child, a boy. When he</div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s2_40">was caught he was about twelve. This time the doctors tried hard. They hospitalised the boy, they</div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s2_40">massaged him, they gave him medicines and everything. Within six months the child was dead,</div>
<div id="ts_40" class="t s2_40">because they tried to make him a human being and his whole being refused. When they got hold of</div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s2_40">him he was so healthy that no human being was ever so healthy. He was wild, he was a wolf, and</div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s2_40">when they hospitalised him and started treating him he became ill; within six months they killed him.</div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s2_40">They were trying to create a human mind, but it was impossible. They only succeeded in training</div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s2_40">him to say one word, his name. They named him Ram. In six months, that was their only success.</div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s2_40">If you asked him: What is your name? the wolf child could say: Ram. That was all.</div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s2_40">A mind is a social function. A wolf needs a mind for a society of wolves; a man needs a mind for a</div>
<div id="tz_40" class="t s2_40">society of men. And because of this there exist many types of human minds because there are so</div>
<div id="t10_40" class="t s2_40">many societies on the earth.</div>
<div id="t11_40" class="t s2_40">A Hindu has a different mind from a Mohammedan; a Christian has a different mind from an</div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s2_40">aboriginal; a Russian has a different mind from an American. They see differently, their perspective</div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s2_40">is different, their interpretation is different.</div>
<div id="t14_40" class="t s2_40">The same thing is seen absolutely differently.</div>
<div id="t15_40" class="t s2_40">Why?</div>
<div id="t16_40" class="t s2_40">Because to exist in a particular society you need a particular mind. In Russia if you believe in God,</div>
<div id="t17_40" class="t s2_40">you are thought to be crazy. In India if you don’t believe in a God you are thought to be crazy.</div>
<div id="t18_40" class="t s2_40">Once it happened that I was conducting a meditation camp and two dogs were watching people</div>
<div id="t19_40" class="t s2_40">doing the dynamic meditation, with chaotic expressions. And then I heard the one dog say to the</div>
<div id="t1a_40" class="t s2_40">other: When I do this, my master gives me worm pills! He thinks I am crazy!</div>
<div id="t1b_40" class="t s2_40">When the Shoe Fits</div>
<div id="t1c_40" class="t s2_40">40</div>
<div id="t1d_40" class="t s3_40">Osho</div>
