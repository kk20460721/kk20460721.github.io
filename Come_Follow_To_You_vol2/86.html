<div id="t1_86" class="t s1_86">Jesus never condemns, Jesus never creates any guilt. Jesus never says, "That is </div>
<div id="t2_86" class="t s1_86">sin. Don't do it." He reveals what is sin, but he never says it. He makes you </div>
<div id="t3_86" class="t s1_86">understand what is sin, but he never gives you a dead dogma in the hand. </div>
<div id="t4_86" class="t s1_86">In life, dead dogmas are useless. Only an alive consciousness is useful because </div>
<div id="t5_86" class="t s1_86">every moment the sin and the virtue changes. Something was a virtue in the </div>
<div id="t6_86" class="t s1_86">morning. It may not be virtuous in the evening. It depends on you, on others, on </div>
<div id="t7_86" class="t s1_86">circumstances. It is not a dead thing that you can carry with you. It is changing </div>
<div id="t8_86" class="t s1_86">every moment. Unless you have a flexibility, a sensitivity to change with life, you </div>
<div id="t9_86" class="t s1_86">will not be able to know what is sin. Every moment life goes on moving. </div>
<div id="ta_86" class="t s1_86">Something was virtuous in a certain moment. The same thing can become a sin in </div>
<div id="tb_86" class="t s1_86">another moment. So no dogma is possible. </div>
<div id="tc_86" class="t s1_86">Jesus gives a sensitivity to people. an awareness, a mindfulness, a meditation, so </div>
<div id="td_86" class="t s1_86">that they can feel their way, so that they can understand every situation and </div>
<div id="te_86" class="t s1_86">respond accordingly. If you go deeply into Jesus you will understand only one </div>
<div id="tf_86" class="t s1_86">thing: that to act with awareness is virtue and to act with unawareness is sin. Sin </div>
<div id="tg_86" class="t s1_86">is not a quality of any act. Neither is virtue. Sin and virtue belong to the presence </div>
<div id="th_86" class="t s1_86">or absence of awareness. It is not WHAT you do which is sin or virtue. it is HOW </div>
<div id="ti_86" class="t s1_86">you do it: aware or unaware. It doesn't depend on the action. It depends, deep </div>
<div id="tj_86" class="t s1_86">down, on the consciousness -- what quality you bring to it. </div>
<div id="tk_86" class="t s1_86">Jesus loved. That was one of his crimes: that hc loved. A rabbi should preach, he </div>
<div id="tl_86" class="t s1_86">should not love. A religious man should become an example, and induce and </div>
<div id="tm_86" class="t s1_86">seduce people to follow his example. He was not an example at all. In the </div>
<div id="tn_86" class="t s1_86">ordinary sense, he was not creating any ideal of his own. He was simply helping </div>
<div id="to_86" class="t s1_86">people to be more prayerful, to be more mindful, to be more watchful. And he </div>
<div id="tp_86" class="t s1_86">lived, and loved. </div>
<div id="tq_86" class="t s1_86">He lived like a very ordinary man. But with very extraordinary awareness. He </div>
<div id="tr_86" class="t s1_86">lived like a Zen master. Jews could not understand him, or only later on. Hassids </div>
<div id="ts_86" class="t s1_86">would have understood, but they came very late. They would have understood </div>
<div id="tt_86" class="t s1_86">him, they would have understood him absolutely. He was a Hassidic master, or a </div>
<div id="tu_86" class="t s1_86">Zen master. </div>
<div id="tv_86" class="t s1_86">But his followers also misunderstood him. They thought that he was a politician </div>
<div id="tw_86" class="t s1_86">and he had come to change the society. His enemies also misunderstood him. </div>
<div id="tx_86" class="t s1_86">The same has happened again and again. I am here. I am not interested in society </div>
<div id="ty_86" class="t s1_86">at all, not a bit. But the politicians go on thinking that I'm planning in some way </div>

<div id="t10_86" class="t s1_86">the society or the government. It is difficult to convince them that I'm not </div>
