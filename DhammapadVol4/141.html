<div id="t1_141" class="t s1_141">communist; somebody talks about DAS KAPITAL and somebody about the Gita and </div>
<div id="t2_141" class="t s1_141">somebody about the Koran, and you start feeling as if you are missing something </div>
<div id="t3_141" class="t s1_141">because you cannot talk about great things. You start feeling these people must be </div>
<div id="t4_141" class="t s1_141">knowing all that they are talking about. They know nothing. They are as blind as you </div>
<div id="t5_141" class="t s1_141">are, or maybe they are more blind than you are. At least you are free of the philosophies </div>
<div id="t6_141" class="t s1_141">-- that is one of the basic hindrances in seeing. </div>
<div id="t7_141" class="t s1_141">The first thing to understand about Buddha and his approach is that he does not want </div>
<div id="t8_141" class="t s1_141">to give you a teaching. He certainly wants to give you a science -- he is not interested at </div>
<div id="t9_141" class="t s1_141">all in making your minds more sophisticated. He wants you to drop the mind. </div>
<div id="ta_141" class="t s1_141">Sophisticated or unsophisticated, mind is a block, it hinders. No-mind is the capacity to </div>
<div id="tb_141" class="t s1_141">see; mind is the capacity to believe, but it is not the capacity to see. </div>
<div id="tc_141" class="t s1_141">Hence Buddha has given a totally new meaning to meditation. Before him, meditation </div>
<div id="td_141" class="t s1_141">was concentration in the beginning and contemplation in the end. But concentration </div>
<div id="te_141" class="t s1_141">and contemplation both are part of the mind; the mind can play these games perfectly </div>
<div id="tf_141" class="t s1_141">well. The mind is very much interested in concentration because through it, it becomes </div>
<div id="tg_141" class="t s1_141">stronger. Concentration is a nourishment. And mind is immensely interested in </div>
<div id="th_141" class="t s1_141">contemplation too, because through contemplation, finer food, finer nourishment, </div>
<div id="ti_141" class="t s1_141">become available. </div>
<div id="tj_141" class="t s1_141">If you concentrate you can become a scientist of the objective world; if you contemplate </div>
<div id="tk_141" class="t s1_141">you become a great philosopher. But unless you know what meditation is you will </div>
<div id="tl_141" class="t s1_141">never be a mystic; and without being a mystic, you will miss all -- your whole life will </div>
<div id="tm_141" class="t s1_141">be a sheer wastage. </div>
<div id="tn_141" class="t s1_141">These sutras are tremendously important. In a few places the translation is not accurate, </div>
<div id="to_141" class="t s1_141">but on the whole it gives you the essence. Wherever I see it is not accurate I will remind </div>
<div id="tp_141" class="t s1_141">you. Those inaccuracies are bound to happen -- because in the West nobody has talked </div>
<div id="tq_141" class="t s1_141">like Buddha; hence no Western language is capable of translating Buddha accurately, </div>
<div id="tr_141" class="t s1_141">adequately. </div>
<div id="ts_141" class="t s1_141">Jesus was a buddha, but his way of talking was not that of Buddha. Jesus talked as if he </div>
<div id="tt_141" class="t s1_141">were talking to primary school children -- and that's exactly the case. The people he was </div>
<div id="tu_141" class="t s1_141">talking to were really at a very very beginners' stage. He had to use parables, </div>
<div id="tv_141" class="t s1_141">metaphors. He had to use phrases which are anthropocentric: kingdom of God -- there </div>
<div id="tw_141" class="t s1_141">is no God and there is no kingdom. And Jesus knew it! -- but he had to talk in words </div>
<div id="tx_141" class="t s1_141">which people could understand. </div>
<div id="ty_141" class="t s1_141">People can understand a king -- then God is the greatest king. But the difference is of </div>
<div id="tz_141" class="t s1_141">quantity, not of quality. Kings have kingdoms; hence God, the greatest king, must have </div>
<div id="t10_141" class="t s1_141">the greatest kingdom. But again the difference is of quantity, not of quality. And </div>
<div id="t11_141" class="t s1_141">because it is not of quality it misses the whole point, it misses the target. </div>
<div id="t12_141" class="t s1_141">God is not a person but a presence. And God had no kingdom because God is a </div>
<div id="t13_141" class="t s1_141">pervading presence of life, of beauty, of music, of poetry. He is spread all over space; he </div>
<div id="t14_141" class="t s1_141">is not separate from it. He is not the creator, he is the very phenomenon of creativity </div>
<div id="t15_141" class="t s1_141">itself. But Jesus could not talk that way -- Buddha could. </div>
<div id="t16_141" class="t s1_141">Buddha was talking to a very ancient people, to people who were very well acquainted </div>
<div id="t17_141" class="t s1_141">with higher reaches -- even they were not able to understand. Jesus had to use language </div>
