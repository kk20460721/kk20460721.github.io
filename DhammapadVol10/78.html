<div id="t7_78" class="t s1_78">towards the saints, the sinners go and bow down to the saints. And the saints are </div>
<div id="t8_78" class="t s1_78">continuously thinking in their minds that maybe they are missing; maybe the sinners </div>

<div id="tc_78" class="t s1_78">towards hell and the prostitute towards heaven. </div>
<div id="td_78" class="t s1_78">The saint said, "Wait! There must be something wrong. You must have misunderstood </div>

<div id="tn_78" class="t s1_78">thought herself capable of entering into the temple. She would sit outside the door and </div>
<div id="to_78" class="t s1_78">listen from there, and tears would flow from her eyes. And she always thought that the </div>
