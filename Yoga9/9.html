<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">Sex is the bridge with the others. Once sex disappears the chain is broken. For the first </div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">time you become an individual. That's why people may be too obsessed with sex, but </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">they are never happy with it -- because it is double-edged. It links you with others; it does </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">not allow you to be individual. It does not allow you to be yourself It forces you into </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">patterns, into slaveries, bondages. But if you don't know how to transcend it, that's the </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">only way how to use your energy. It becomes a safety valve. </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">People who live at the first center, muladhar, live only for a very foolish reason. They go </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">on creating energy, and then they are too burdened with it; then they go on throwing it. </div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s1_9">They eat, they work, they sleep, they do many things to create energy. Then they say, </div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">"What to do with it7 It is very heavy." Then they throw it. Seems a very vicious circle. </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">When they throw it they again feel empty. They fill up with new fuel, with new food, </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">with new work, and again when the energy is there they are "feeling too full," they say. </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">Somewhere it has to be released. And sex becomes just a release: a vicious circle of </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">accumulating energy, throwing energy, accumulating energy, throwing energy. It looks </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">almost absurd. </div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s1_9">Unless you know that there are higher centers within you which can take that energy, use </div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s1_9">it in a creative way, you will remain confirmed to the sexual vicious circle. That's why all </div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s1_9">the religions insist on some sort of sexual control. It can become repressive, it can </div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s1_9">become dangerous. If new centers are not opening and you go on damming energy, </div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s1_9">condemning, forcing, repressing, then you are on a volcano. Any day you will explode; </div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s1_9">you will become neurotic. You are going to be mad. Then it is better to relieve it. But </div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s1_9">there are centers which can absorb the energy, and greater being and greater possibilities </div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s1_9">can be revealed to you. </div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s1_9">Remember, we have been saying in the past few days that the second center, near the sex </div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s1_9">center, is hara, the center of death. That's why people are afraid to move beyond sex </div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s1_9">because the moment the energy moves beyond sex it touches the -hara center and one </div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s1_9">becomes afraid. That's why_ people are even afraid to move deep in love because when </div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s1_9">you move deep in love the sex center creates such ripples that the ripples enter in the hara </div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">center and fear arises. </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">So many people come to me and they say, "Why do we feel so much afraid of the other </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">sex?" -- of men or women"Why do we feel so much afraid?" It is not the fear of the other </div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s1_9">sex. It is the fear of sex itself because if you go deep in sex, then the center becomes </div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s1_9">more dynamic, creates bigger energy fields, and those energy fields start overlapping the </div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s1_9">hara center. Have you watched2 In a sexual orgasm something starts moving just below </div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s1_9">your navel, throbbing. That throb is the overlapping of the sex center with the hara. That's </div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s1_9">why people become afraid of sex also. Particularly people become afraid of deep </div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s1_9">intimacy, of orgasm itself. </div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s1_9">But that second center has to be entered, penetrated, opened. That's the meaning when </div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s1_9">Jesus says unless you are ready to die you cannot be reborn. </div>
<div id="t14_9" class="t s1_9">Just two, three days before, on Easter, somebody asked a question that, "Today is Easter. </div>
<div id="t15_9" class="t s1_9">Osho, have you something to say?" I have only one thing to say, that each day is Easter, </div>
<div id="t16_9" class="t s1_9">because Easter is the day of Jesus' resurrection -- his crucifiction and resurrection, his </div>
<div id="t17_9" class="t s1_9">death and his being reborn. Each day is an Easter if you are ready to move into the hara </div>
<div id="t18_9" class="t s1_9">center. You will be crucified first -- the cross is there within your hara center. You are </div>
<div id="t19_9" class="t s1_9">already carrying it; you just have to move to it and you have to die through it, and then </div>
<div id="t1a_9" class="t s1_9">there is resurrection. </div>
