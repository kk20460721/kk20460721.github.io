<div id="t1_332" class="t s1_332">I was from my very childhood in love with silence. As long as I could manage I would just</div>
<div id="t2_332" class="t s1_332">sit silently. Naturally my family used to think that I was going to be good for nothing -- and</div>
<div id="t3_332" class="t s1_332">they were right. I certainly proved good for nothing, but I don't repent it.</div>
<div id="t4_332" class="t s1_332">It came to such a point that sometimes I would be sitting and my mother would come to</div>
<div id="t5_332" class="t s1_332">me and say something like, "There seems to be nobody in the whole house. I need somebody</div>
<div id="t6_332" class="t s1_332">to go to the market to fetch some vegetables." I was sitting in front of her, and I would say, "If</div>
<div id="t7_332" class="t s1_332">I see somebody I will tell ..."</div>
<div id="t8_332" class="t s1_332">It was accepted that my presence meant nothing; whether I was there or not, it did not</div>
<div id="t9_332" class="t s1_332">matter. Once or twice they tried and then they found that "it is better to leave him out, and not</div>
<div id="ta_332" class="t s1_332">take any notice of him" -- because in the morning they would send me to fetch vegetables, and</div>
<div id="tb_332" class="t s1_332">in the evening I would come to ask, "I have forgotten for what you had sent me, and now the</div>
<div id="tc_332" class="t s1_332">market is closed ..." In villages the vegetable markets close by the evening, and the villagers</div>
<div id="td_332" class="t s1_332">go back to their villages.</div>
<div id="te_332" class="t s1_332">My mother said, "It is not your fault, it is our fault. The whole day we have been waiting,</div>
<div id="tf_332" class="t s1_332">but in the first place we should not have asked you. Where have you been?"</div>
<div id="tg_332" class="t s1_332">I said, "As I went out of the house, just close by there was a very beautiful bodhi tree" --</div>
<div id="th_332" class="t s1_332">the kind of tree under which Gautam Buddha became awakened. The tree got the name bodhi</div>
<div id="ti_332" class="t s1_332">tree -- or in English, bo tree -- because of Gautam Buddha. One does not know what it used to</div>
<div id="tj_332" class="t s1_332">be called before Gautam Buddha; it must have had some name, but after Buddha it became</div>
<div id="tk_332" class="t s1_332">associated with his name.</div>
<div id="tl_332" class="t s1_332">There was a beautiful bodhi tree, and it was so tempting for me. There used to be always</div>
<div id="tm_332" class="t s1_332">such silence, such coolness underneath it, nobody to disturb me, that I could not pass it</div>
<div id="tn_332" class="t s1_332">without sitting under it for some time. And those moments of peace, I think sometimes may</div>
<div id="to_332" class="t s1_332">have stretched the whole day.</div>
<div id="tp_332" class="t s1_332">After just a few disappointments they thought, "It is better not to bother him." And I was</div>
<div id="tq_332" class="t s1_332">immensely happy that they had accepted the fact that I am almost non-existent. It gave me</div>
<div id="tr_332" class="t s1_332">tremendous freedom. Nobody expected anything from me. When nobody expects anything</div>
<div id="ts_332" class="t s1_332">from you, you fall into a silence ... The world has accepted you; now there is no expectation</div>
<div id="tt_332" class="t s1_332">from you.</div>
<div id="tu_332" class="t s1_332">When sometimes I was late coming home, they used to search for me in two places. One</div>
<div id="tv_332" class="t s1_332">was the bodhi tree -- and because they started searching for me under the bodhi tree, I started</div>
<div id="tw_332" class="t s1_332">climbing the tree and sitting in the top of it. They would come and they would look around</div>
<div id="tx_332" class="t s1_332">and say, "He does not seem to be here."</div>
<div id="ty_332" class="t s1_332">And I myself would nod; I said, "Yes, that's true. I'm not here."</div>
<div id="tz_332" class="t s1_332">But I was soon discovered, because somebody saw me climbing and told them, "He has</div>
<div id="t10_332" class="t s1_332">been deceiving you. He is always here, most of the time sitting in the tree" -- so I had to go a</div>
<div id="t11_332" class="t s1_332">little further.</div>
<div id="t12_332" class="t s1_332">There used to be a Mohammedan cemetery ... Now people ordinarily don't go to</div>
<div id="t13_332" class="t s1_332">graveyards. Of course, everybody has to go once, but except that, people don't like going to</div>
<div id="t14_332" class="t s1_332">graveyards. So that was the most silent place ... because dead people don't talk, they don't</div>
<div id="t15_332" class="t s1_332">create nuisance, they don't ask you unnecessary questions, they don't even ask you who you</div>
<div id="t16_332" class="t s1_332">are or for introductions.</div>
<div id="t17_332" class="t s1_332">Chapter 28 - Mindlessness</div>
<div id="t18_332" class="t s1_332">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t19_332" class="t s1_332">332</div>
