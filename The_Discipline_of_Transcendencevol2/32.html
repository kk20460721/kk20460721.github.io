<div id="t1_32" class="t s1_32">So if he had to go to the station to catch a train, he would go under police escort, </div>
<div id="t2_32" class="t s1_32">otherwise people would tear his clothes. Not only that -- his skin would be torn, </div>
<div id="t3_32" class="t s1_32">and he would come home with blood flowing. </div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s1_32">He became so fed up with this fame -- that he could not even get out of his </div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s1_32">house; people were always there like wolves to jump upon him -- and he started </div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s1_32">praying to god, 'Finished! I have known this. I don't want it. I have become </div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s1_32">almost a dead person.' And then it happened. The angel came, must have come, </div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s1_32">and he said, 'Okay.' By and by his fame disappeared. </div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s1_32">People's opinions change very easily; they don't have any integrity. Just like </div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s1_32">fashion, things change. You can be famous one day, the next day you can become </div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s1_32">the most notorious man. One day you are at the top of your fame, the next day </div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s1_32">people completely forget about you. One day you are the president, the next day </div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s1_32">you are just citizen Richard Nixon. Nobody bothers. </div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s1_32">It happened that people's minds changed, the opinion, the climate changed, and </div>
<div id="tf_32" class="t s1_32">people completely forgot about him. He would come to the station and he would </div>
<div id="tg_32" class="t s1_32">long that at least someone, at least one person must be waiting there to receive </div>
<div id="th_32" class="t s1_32">him. And nobody would come to receive him -- only his dog. </div>
<div id="ti_32" class="t s1_32">When he died, there were only four persons giving him the last goodbye; three </div>
<div id="tj_32" class="t s1_32">were men and the fourth was his dog. He must have died in misery, again </div>
<div id="tk_32" class="t s1_32">hankering for fame. What to do? This is how things go on. </div>
<div id="tl_32" class="t s1_32">Mind will never allow you to be happy. Whatsoever the condition, the mind will </div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s1_32">always find something to be unhappy about. Let me say it in this way: mind is a </div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s1_32">mechanism to create unhappiness. Its whole function is to create unhappiness. </div>
<div id="to_32" class="t s1_32">If you drop the mind, suddenly you become happy... for no reason at all. Then </div>
<div id="tp_32" class="t s1_32">happiness is just natural, as you breathe. For breathing, you need not be even </div>
<div id="tq_32" class="t s1_32">aware. You simply go on breathing. Conscious, unconscious, awake, asleep, you </div>
<div id="tr_32" class="t s1_32">go on breathing. Happiness is exactly like that. </div>
<div id="ts_32" class="t s1_32">That's why in the East we say that happiness is your innermost nature. It needs </div>
<div id="tt_32" class="t s1_32">no outside condition; it is simply there, it is you. Bliss is your natural state; it is </div>
<div id="tu_32" class="t s1_32">not an achievement. If you simply get out of the mechanism of the mind, you </div>
<div id="tv_32" class="t s1_32">start feeling blissful. </div>
<div id="tw_32" class="t s1_32">That's why you will see that mad people are more happy than so-called sane </div>
<div id="tx_32" class="t s1_32">people. What happens to mad people? They also get out of the mind -- of course </div>
<div id="ty_32" class="t s1_32">in a wrong way, but they get out of the mind. A madman is one who has fallen </div>
<div id="tz_32" class="t s1_32">below the mind. He's out of the mind. That's why you can see that mad people </div>
<div id="t10_32" class="t s1_32">are so happy. You can feel jealous. You can even daydream, 'When will this </div>
<div id="t11_32" class="t s1_32">blessing happen to us?' He is condemned, but he is happy. </div>
<div id="t12_32" class="t s1_32">What has happened to a madman? He is no more thinking of the past and no </div>
<div id="t13_32" class="t s1_32">more thinking of the future. He has dropped out of time. He has started living in </div>
<div id="t14_32" class="t s1_32">eternity. </div>
<div id="t15_32" class="t s1_32">It happens the same way to the mystic also, because he goes above mind. I am </div>
<div id="t16_32" class="t s1_32">not telling you to become mad, but I am telling you that there is a similarity </div>
