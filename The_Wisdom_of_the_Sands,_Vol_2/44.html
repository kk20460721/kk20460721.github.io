<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">CHAPTER 3. YOU ARE HERE TO BE YOURSELF</div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s2_44">He declared, ”I am God! I have attained, I have arrived! I have fulﬁlled the promise of the seers.”</div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s2_44">That was very offensive.</div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s2_44">The same happened with Jesus. What was his crime? Why was he cruciﬁed? – for a very simple</div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s2_44">reason: he declared, ”I have come. I am the one for whom you have been waiting.” People were</div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s2_44">very happy waiting for him, but you should not come, you should leave them alone. They could go</div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s2_44">on waiting for you for eternity, but when you come, you destroy many things. First, you destroy their</div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s2_44">hope. Now that you have come they can’t hope, they can’t wait for something: you have taken away</div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s2_44">their future. That was their only joy of living: that the Messiah would be coming that soon he would</div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s2_44">come. They were thrilled with the future. Now suddenly the Messiah is here! And he said, ”I have</div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s2_44">come... for whom you have been waiting!” They were offended. They didn’t like this idea; you are</div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s2_44">destroying their whole future,, you are taking their hope away. Once this hope is gone they will be</div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s2_44">left simply in misery. They were hiding their misery behind this hope.</div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s2_44">What was so outrageous in Jesus’ statements that he had to be cruciﬁed?</div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s2_44">Just the other day I was reading a passage.</div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s2_44">The Gospel describes the event: And he came to</div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s2_44">Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And he went to the synagogue and he stood up to read.</div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s2_44">He opened the book of the prophet Isaiah and read: ”The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because</div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s2_44">he has anointed me to preach good news. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and</div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s2_44">recover sight to the blind.” In his commentary Jesus spoke one single sentence so explosive that his</div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s2_44">hearers did not allow him to continue but rushed him outside to kill him. And what did he say that</div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s2_44">was so outrageous? – simply, ”Today this scripture has been fulﬁlled in your hearing.” That was his</div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s2_44">comment.</div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s2_44">This passage has been commented on by thousands and thousands of rabbis down the ages.</div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s2_44">Nobody had taken any offense. They were simply commenting on the prophet Isaiah’s statement.</div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s2_44">Jesus did not comment. He declared, ”I am here! I have come! The spirit of the Lord is upon me! ”</div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s2_44">He is not a commentator. He himself is the commentary, an alive statement. He said, ”The word has</div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s2_44">become ﬂesh in me. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach good</div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s2_44">news!” The statement Jesus made is not in inverted commas. That is the only difference that he has</div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s2_44">made – he has removed the inverted commas. If those inverted commas had not been removed,</div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s2_44">people would not have been offended. If he had simply quoted Isaiah’s saying, there would have</div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s2_44">been no problem. But he said, ”The spirit of the Lord is upon me! ” – without inverted commas –</div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s2_44">”because he has anointed me to preach good news. He has sent me to proclaim release to the</div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s2_44">captives and recover sight to the blind.” And a small comment at the end: ”Today this scripture has</div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s2_44">been fulﬁlled in your hearing.” And people were so mad! They simply took him away. They took him</div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s2_44">on top of a cliff, they wanted to throw him to his death. They were immensely offended.</div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s2_44">And Jesus belonged to that place. He was born there, he was brought up there – and that was the</div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s2_44">problem. People knew him perfectly well: ”He is the son of that carpenter, Joseph, and his wife,</div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s2_44">Mary. And this carpenter’s son... uneducated, unfamiliar with the scriptures, not a learned man at</div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s2_44">all, is either mad or a hypocrite, has gone insane or is egoistic, declaring that ’Today the scripture</div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s2_44">has been fulﬁlled in your hearing! I have come. Isaiah was talking about me. It has happened before</div>
<div id="t16_44" class="t s2_44">your eyes. In your hearing the scripture is fulﬁlled.’”</div>
<div id="t17_44" class="t s2_44">It was on that day that Jesus made the famous statement: ”No prophet is acceptable in his own</div>
<div id="t18_44" class="t s2_44">country.”</div>
<div id="t19_44" class="t s2_44">The Wisdom of the Sands, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t1a_44" class="t s2_44">44</div>
<div id="t1b_44" class="t s3_44">Osho</div>
