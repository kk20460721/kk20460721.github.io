<div id="t2_24" class="t s1_24">hatred, condemnation. But because the master had said, "Watch and go and ask him for </div>
<div id="t3_24" class="t s1_24">advice..." he forgot all about his problem. First he asked, "Please tell me what is </div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s1_24">happening. What are you doing?" </div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s1_24">The madman laughed and he said, "This boy is my son. And come close -- my glass </div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s1_24">contains only water. What he is pouring is not wine." </div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s1_24">The man asked, "Then why are you pretending that you are drinking wine? Nobody </div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s1_24">sips water the way you are sipping. The flask from which he is pouring water is not </div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s1_24">used for keeping water -- then why?" </div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s1_24">The madman laughed and said, "So that nobody entrusts his beautiful daughter to me </div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s1_24">when he goes on a pilgrimage. This is a device!" </div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s1_24">He must have read the thought, he must have been telepathic. He must have seen this </div>

<div id="te_24" class="t s1_24">nobody bothers. So that I am left alone. But please don't tell my secret to anybody; </div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s1_24">otherwise I will have to move from this town to another town. My madness is a rumor </div>

<div id="to_24" class="t s1_24">carpenters and the potters...that will be the facade. People who will come as visitors, we </div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s1_24">will have a beautiful showroom for them; they can purchase things. They can see the </div>
