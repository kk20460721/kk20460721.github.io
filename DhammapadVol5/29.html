<div id="t1_29" class="t s1_29">While on their honeymoon, Kit and Netty bought a talkative parrot and took it back to </div>
<div id="t2_29" class="t s1_29">their hotel room. As they made love the bird kept up a running commentary. Finally Kit </div>
<div id="t3_29" class="t s1_29">flung a bath towel over the cage and said, "If you don't shut up I am sending you to the </div>
<div id="t4_29" class="t s1_29">zoo!" </div>
<div id="t5_29" class="t s1_29">Getting ready to leave the following morning, they could not close a bulging suitcase </div>
<div id="t6_29" class="t s1_29">and decided one of them would stand on it while the other attempted to fasten it. </div>
<div id="t7_29" class="t s1_29">"Darling," said Kit, "you get on top and I will try." </div>
<div id="t8_29" class="t s1_29">That didn't work. So he said, "Now I will get on top and you try." </div>
<div id="t9_29" class="t s1_29">That didn't work either. </div>
<div id="ta_29" class="t s1_29">"Look," said Kit, "let us both get on top and try." </div>
<div id="tb_29" class="t s1_29">The parrot yanked away the towel and said, "Zoo or no zoo, this I've gotta see!" </div>
<div id="tc_29" class="t s1_29">The parrot must have been a male! </div>
<div id="td_29" class="t s1_29">I told the woman, "Your husband is right: before you enter on the path of meditation </div>
<div id="te_29" class="t s1_29">you have to consider it, because there are dangers ahead." </div>
<div id="tf_29" class="t s1_29">She didn't listen to me; she started meditating. Now she is divorced. She came to see me </div>
<div id="tg_29" class="t s1_29">after a few years and said, "You were right. The more silent I became, the more my </div>
<div id="th_29" class="t s1_29">husband became furious at me. He was never so violent -- something strange started </div>
<div id="ti_29" class="t s1_29">happening," she told me. "The more silent and quiet I was becoming, the more </div>
<div id="tj_29" class="t s1_29">aggressive he was becoming." His whole male chauvinist mind was at stake. He wanted </div>
<div id="tk_29" class="t s1_29">to destroy the peace and the silence that was happening to the woman so he could still </div>
<div id="tl_29" class="t s1_29">remain superior. And because it could not happen the way he wanted, he divorced the </div>
<div id="tm_29" class="t s1_29">woman. </div>
<div id="tn_29" class="t s1_29">It is a very strange world! If you become peaceful your relationship with people will </div>
<div id="to_29" class="t s1_29">change, because you are a different person. If your relationship was because of your </div>
<div id="tp_29" class="t s1_29">misery it may disappear. </div>
<div id="tq_29" class="t s1_29">I used to have a friend. He was a professor in the same university where I was a </div>
<div id="tr_29" class="t s1_29">professor; he was a great social worker. In India, what to do with the widows is still a </div>
<div id="ts_29" class="t s1_29">problem. Nobody wants to marry them, and widows are not in favor of marrying </div>
<div id="tt_29" class="t s1_29">either; that seems like a sin. And this professor was determined to marry a widow. He </div>
<div id="tu_29" class="t s1_29">was not concerned whether he was in love with the woman or not -- that was </div>
<div id="tv_29" class="t s1_29">secondary, irrelevant -- his only interest was that she should be a widow. And he </div>
<div id="tw_29" class="t s1_29">persuaded her slowly slowly, and she was ready. </div>
<div id="tx_29" class="t s1_29">I told the man, "Before you take the plunge, consider it for at least three days -- go into </div>
<div id="ty_29" class="t s1_29">isolation. Are you in love with the woman, or is it just a great social service that you are </div>
<div id="tz_29" class="t s1_29">doing?" Marrying a widow in India is thought to be something very revolutionary, </div>
<div id="t10_29" class="t s1_29">something radical. "Are you just trying to prove that you are a revolutionary? If you are </div>
<div id="t11_29" class="t s1_29">trying to prove that you are a revolutionary, then you are bound for trouble -- because </div>
<div id="t12_29" class="t s1_29">the moment you are married she will no longer be a widow and your whole interest </div>
<div id="t13_29" class="t s1_29">will be gone." </div>
