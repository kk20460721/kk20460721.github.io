<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">they will laugh. Jesus will simply feel embarrassed. </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">This is my understanding: that the Jews of Jesus' days were very simple people, </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">not sophisticated. Religion was very meaningful, not just a philosophy. Their </div>

<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">all that they had been protecting for centuries; this man was trying to create a </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">revolution, a chaos. They had deep love for the tradition, for the values that they </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">had always cherished. They were not indifferent, they COULD not be indifferent. </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">Either they had to follow Jesus or they had to kill him. There was no other </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">alternative. </div>

<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">the head. </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">To me, the crucifixion of Jesus simply shows one thing: that they took Jesus </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">seriously. Buddha was never taken that seriously. We could tolerate him. "lt's </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">okay, let him do his thing. Nothing much is going to happen out of it. Why kill </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">him unnecessarily? By killing him, there may even be more danger because the </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">death will create a stir." </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">Jesus, if he was in India, would have become one of the AVATARS. But nothing </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">much. Nothing much -- we would have included him in the tradition. </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">Even Buddha has been included. Buddha denied all that is basic to Hinduism, </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">but Hindus are very sophisticated people. They said, "Yes, this too is a message </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">from God." He was contradicting all that is meaningful to Hindus, but they were </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">not bothered. They said, "He is also an incarnation of God." </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">Hindus have written a story about Buddha that shows how sophisticated minds </div>

<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">They say that God created the world, heaven and hell. Centuries and centuries </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">passed. People would die and immediately they would go to heaven. Nobody </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">would go to hell because nobody was a sinner. So the people who were </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">managing hell -- the devil and his disciples -- went to God and said, "Why have </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">you created hell? Nobody ever comes. Our whole existence is futile. We go on </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">sitting and sitting and waiting, and nobody knocks at the door. Either cancel it -- </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">or send people!" </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">God said. "Wait. Soon I am going to a womb to be born as Gautam Buddha. I will </div>

<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">to hell." </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">That's why Buddha was born. An incarnation of God: to spoil people's minds. </div>
<div id="t16_54" class="t s1_54">And since then, hell is overflowing. This is a sophisticated way to tackle with a </div>
<div id="t17_54" class="t s1_54">man like Buddha. </div>
<div id="t18_54" class="t s1_54">Jews were simple. They simply could not tolerate this man. They killed him. That </div>
