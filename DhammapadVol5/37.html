<div id="t1_37" class="t s1_37">peaceful, with no thoughts in the mind, a consciousness without content. That is the </div>
<div id="t2_37" class="t s1_37">true meaning of meditation: a pure consciousness, a mirror reflecting nothing. When a </div>
<div id="t3_37" class="t s1_37">mirror is not reflecting anything, it is meditation. </div>
<div id="t4_37" class="t s1_37">Buddha turned the whole religious quest from metaphysics into a great psychology, </div>
<div id="t5_37" class="t s1_37">because he asked: What are the causes of my life and my death? He is not concerned </div>
<div id="t6_37" class="t s1_37">with the universe. He says: We should start from the beginning, and anything, to have a </div>
<div id="t7_37" class="t s1_37">real significance in life, has to be concerned with me MYSELF: who am I and why am I? </div>
<div id="t8_37" class="t s1_37">What are the causes that go on creating me? </div>
<div id="t9_37" class="t s1_37">His first sutra is: </div>
<div id="ta_37" class="t s1_37">VAINLY I SOUGHT THE BUILDER OF MY HOUSE </div>
<div id="tb_37" class="t s1_37">THROUGH COUNTLESS LIVES. </div>
<div id="tc_37" class="t s1_37">He is saying, "I have been seeking and searching for God for countless lives. It was all in </div>
<div id="td_37" class="t s1_37">vain, it was futile. I could not find any God, because in fact God is not a person and you </div>
<div id="te_37" class="t s1_37">cannot find him. God is not a 'he'." </div>
<div id="tf_37" class="t s1_37">Now there is great controversy whether God is a he or a she. He is neither. And if you </div>
<div id="tg_37" class="t s1_37">insist that we have to choose between these two words, 'he' and 'she', I will suggest that </div>
<div id="th_37" class="t s1_37">'she' is far better because she contains he, but he does not contain she. But in truth, God </div>
<div id="ti_37" class="t s1_37">is not a person at all; hence the question of whether he is he or she is irrelevant. </div>
<div id="tj_37" class="t s1_37">God is a quality, not an object. God is not God but godliness -- and godliness has to be </div>
<div id="tk_37" class="t s1_37">found first within yourself. Unless you have a taste of it in your own being you will not </div>
<div id="tl_37" class="t s1_37">be able to see it anywhere else. Once you have tasted it, once you have become drunk </div>
<div id="tm_37" class="t s1_37">on the divine, then you will see it in the trees -- in the green of the trees, in the red of the </div>
<div id="tn_37" class="t s1_37">trees, in the gold of the trees. You will see it in the sun, in the moon, in the stars. You </div>
<div id="to_37" class="t s1_37">will be able to see it in the animals, birds, people, rivers, mountains. The whole </div>
<div id="tp_37" class="t s1_37">existence will reflect your understanding, will become a mirror to you. You will be able </div>
<div id="tq_37" class="t s1_37">to see your own face everywhere. We can see only that which we are, we cannot see that </div>
<div id="tr_37" class="t s1_37">which we are not. </div>
<div id="ts_37" class="t s1_37">This is Buddha's great contribution: he dropped prayer, he dropped the idea of God, </div>
<div id="tt_37" class="t s1_37">and he gave a new approach -- that new approach is meditation. </div>
<div id="tu_37" class="t s1_37">He says: VAINLY I SOUGHT THE BUILDER OF MY HOUSE THROUGH COUNTLESS </div>

<div id="tw_37" class="t s1_37">....</div>
<div id="tx_37" class="t s1_37">Not because something was lacking in his effort, </div>
<div id="ty_37" class="t s1_37">not because his effort was partial and not total, no. He was not that kind of man: his </div>
<div id="tz_37" class="t s1_37">effort was so total that it could not have been more total. It was because of his total </div>
<div id="t10_37" class="t s1_37">effort that he came to this great understanding, that he came to this great realization. </div>
<div id="t11_37" class="t s1_37">He went to all kinds of teachers and whatsoever a teacher told him to do, he did it with </div>
<div id="t12_37" class="t s1_37">such passion, intensity, that no teacher was ever able to find any fault with him. And </div>
<div id="t13_37" class="t s1_37">whatever task was given to him, he always fulfilled it. And it happened with so many </div>
<div id="t14_37" class="t s1_37">teachers that finally they said to him, "This is all that we know, and we cannot say that </div>
<div id="t15_37" class="t s1_37">you have not followed us. You have followed so totally that there is no question about </div>
<div id="t16_37" class="t s1_37">your sincerity and your search, but more than this we don't know. You will have to go </div>
