<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">guest never disappears. The guest only moves from one abode to another. One day, </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">ultimately, the guest starts living under the sky, with no shelter...but the guest </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">continues. Only bodies, houses, come and go, are born and then die. But there is an </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">inner continuum, an inner continuity -- that is eternal, timeless, deathless. </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">Whenever you can love a master -- a master like Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu -- </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">if your passion is total, immediately you are bridged. </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">My talking on Buddha is not just a commentary: it is creating a bridge. Buddha is one of </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">the most important masters who has ever existed on the earth -- incomparable, unique. </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">And if you can have a taste of his being, you will be infinitely benefited, blessed. </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">I am immensely glad, because after these ten days of silence I can say to you that many </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">of you are now ready to commune with me in silence. That is the ultimate in </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">communication. Words are inadequate; words say, but only partially. Silence </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">communes totally. </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">And to use words is a dangerous game too, because the meaning will remain with me, </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">only the word will reach you; and you will give it your own meaning, your own color. </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">It will not contain the same truth that it was meant to contain. It will contain something </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">else, something far poorer. It will contain your meaning, not my meaning. You can </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">distort language -- in fact it is almost impossible to avoid distortion -- but you cannot </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">distort silence. Either you understand or you don't understand. </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">And for these ten days there were only two categories of people here: those who </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">understood and those who did not. But there was not a single person who </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">misunderstood. You cannot misunderstand silence -- that's the beauty of silence. The </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">demarcation is absolute: either you understand or, simply, you don't understand -- </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">there is nothing to misunderstand. </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">With words the case is just the opposite: it is very difficult to understand, it is very </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">difficult to understand that you don't understand; these two are almost impossibilities. </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">And the third is the only possibility: misunderstanding. </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">These ten days have been of strange beauty, and of a mysterious majesty too. I no </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">longer really belong to this shore. My ship has been waiting for me for a long time -- I </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">should have gone. It is a miracle that I am still in the body. The whole credit goes to </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">you: to your love, to your prayers, to your longing. You would like me to linger a little </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">while longer on this shore, hence the impossible has become possible. </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">These ten days, I was not feeling together with my body. I was feeling very uprooted, </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">dislocated. It is strange to be in the body when you don't feel that you are in the body. </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">And it is also strange to go on living in a place which no longer belongs to you -- my </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">home is on the other shore. And the call comes persistently. But because you need me, it </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">is the compassion of the universe -- you can call it God's compassion -- that is allowing </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">me to be in the body a little more. </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">It was strange, it was beautiful, it was mysterious, it was majestic, it was magical. And </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">many of you have felt it. Many of you have felt it in different ways. A few have felt it as </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">a very frightening phenomenon, as if death is knocking on the door. A few have felt it </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">as a great confusion. A few have felt shocked, utterly shocked. But everybody has been </div>
<div id="t17_4" class="t s1_4">touched in some way or other. </div>
