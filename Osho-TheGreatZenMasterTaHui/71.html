<div id="t9_71" class="t s1_71">Buddha has said again and again, "I am just a finger pointing to the moon, and my</div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s1_71">insistence is: 'Don't look at my finger but look at the moon.' My finger does not mean</div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s1_71">anything; the reality is there in the moon. Forget my finger, and look at the moon." So even</div>

<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">the direction. Naturally, for an intellectual, a philosopher, this is not much.</div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">Ta Hui's whole approach is such that it is mixed. To sort out what he has got from</div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s1_71">enlightened people, what he has got from learned people, and what he has made up himself is</div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s1_71">not difficult for me, but it will be difficult for you. And that's the reason I have chosen the</div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">book. This will give you the idea that whenever you are reading someone or listening to</div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s1_71">someone you must be very alert. Has the man the presence, the depth, the silence, the</div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s1_71">authority that comes out of one's own experience? Or is he just a knowledgeable person? And</div>
<div id="tk_71" class="t s1_71">ask people, "Do you know it yourself?" and you will immediately find ... if they hesitate even</div>

<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">From my very childhood that has been the most interesting game that I have been engaged</div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">in. I have never played with the boys of my age. My whole time was involved in a different</div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">kind of game. One swami, Swarupananda, used to come to the town often, and he used to stay</div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s1_71">with one of my father's friends. The friend was very rich and was well known as a wise man;</div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s1_71">all the saints used to stay in his guest house. But he was very angry with me, because</div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">whenever he arranged a meeting for his saints, I was always in the front row.</div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">I always used to take my grandfather with me, and my grandfather was really, even in his</div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">old age, a very juicy man. He would go on hitting me, saying "Start! Do something."</div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s1_71">And I would suggest, "But let him speak, let him say something that I can find fault with."</div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s1_71">And in the middle I would stand up and ask just a single question, "Is this your own feeling,</div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s1_71">your own experience? And remember, you are in the temple of God" -- these meetings used to</div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s1_71">happen in the most beautiful temple in the city -- "so you cannot lie!" And the man would</div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s1_71">hesitate, and I would say, "Your hesitation is saying everything! Either you know, or you don't</div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s1_71">know. Where is the space for hesitation?"</div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s1_71">Intellectuals can talk about all kinds of things. Catch hold of their necks and ask them, "Is</div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s1_71">it your own experience?" -- and just look in their eyes. You will be surprised that out of a</div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s1_71">hundred perhaps you may find one man who is speaking out of some experience; otherwise,</div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s1_71">all is borrowed. And all that is borrowed is simply crap. These people have harmed humanity</div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s1_71">more than anybody else because they speak beautiful words, but those beautiful words are</div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s1_71">dead. And because of these people it has become difficult to find a real master, because there</div>
<div id="t16_71" class="t s1_71">are so many fake teachers all over the world.</div>
<div id="t17_71" class="t s1_71">This is the greatest dishonesty that man can do to humanity. You can cheat people out of</div>
<div id="t18_71" class="t s1_71">money, there is nothing much in it; you can be a con-man and do all kinds of deceiving ... it is</div>
<div id="t19_71" class="t s1_71">all okay with me because it does not matter whether the money is in one's pocket or in</div>
