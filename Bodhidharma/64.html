<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">is far greater than the whole kingdom. It is far greater than the super-rich man's </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">whole treasury. I am poor, but I am perfectly okay; I earn my livelihood. There is </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">no need for me to be rich. But it will be a historical event remembered for </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">centuries and centuries -- as long as man remembers you, Sudas will be </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">remembered and his flower will be remembered. You just take it in your hand." </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">Buddha took the flower in his hand ...and this was the time of the morning when </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">he used to give his morning sermon. Everybody was waiting for him to start but </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">rather than starting the morning sermon, he simply went on looking at the lotus </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">flower. Minutes passed, one hour passed. People started becoming restless, </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">thinking, "What has happened? This flower seems to be something magical that </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">he is simply looking at the flower." </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">At that moment Mahakashyapa, one of the disciples of Gautam Buddha -- who </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">had never spoken, and who had not been mentioned before this or again after </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">this, in any scriptures -- laughed. And Gautam Buddha called Mahakashyapa, </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">and gave the flower to him. </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">And he said, "It is not only the flower that I am giving to you, I am transmitting </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">to you my whole light, my whole fragrance, my whole awakening. It is a </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">transmission in silence; this flower is only symbolic." </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">This is the beginning of Zen. </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">People asked Mahakashyapa, "What happened? Although we were present and </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">we were eyewitnesses, we could not see anything except the flower being given </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">to you. And you touched the feet of Gautam Buddha and went back to your seat </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">again and closed your eyes. What happened?" </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">Mahakashyapa is reported to have said only one thing: "You ask my master. </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">While he is alive, I have no right to answer." And Gautam Buddha said, "This is a </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">new beginning, of transferring without words my whole experience. One just has </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">to be receptive. And Mahakashyapa, by his laughter, showed his receptivity. You </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">don't know why he laughed. He laughed because in that moment, he suddenly </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">looked into himself and he found that he is also a buddha. And I offered the </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">flower as a recognition -- `I accept your awakening.'" </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">This man Mahakashyapa was the founder of Zen -- or this situation between </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">Mahakashyapa and Gautam Buddha is the beginning of the river of Zen. But </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">Bodhidharma was such a strong individual that he has almost become the </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">founder, although he came one thousand years later than Mahakashyapa. But he </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">is immensely articulate. He can say things which cannot be said. He can speak </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">the unspeakable. He can find ways and means and devices to bring you back </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">home, to awaken you to your self-nature. </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">MAHAKASHYAPA ONLY REALIZED HIS OWN NATURE. Nothing was given </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">to him; it was only a recognition from the master. The master never gives </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">anything to the disciple except the final recognition. The disciple already has </div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s1_64">everything. He just has to be tricked in some way to look into himself. All the </div>
<div id="t16_64" class="t s1_64">meditations are simply arbitrary methods to look into yourself. Once you look </div>
<div id="t17_64" class="t s1_64">into yourself the master can give you the recognition. </div>
