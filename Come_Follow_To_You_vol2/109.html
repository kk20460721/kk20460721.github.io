<div id="t2_109" class="t s1_109">Jesus looked back and said, "Yet the morning is far away." </div>
<div id="t3_109" class="t s1_109">Again at the gate of the prison somebody asked and the disciple again denied -- </div>
<div id="t4_109" class="t s1_109">three times before the sun had risen. The disciple must have understood the </div>
<div id="t5_109" class="t s1_109">word in the stony place, in the head. The head cannot sacrifice. Only the heart </div>
<div id="t6_109" class="t s1_109">can sacrifice. </div>
<div id="t7_109" class="t s1_109">Unless you are ready to sacrifice your all, God cannot become a truth to you. He </div>
<div id="t8_109" class="t s1_109">demands all, not a small bit less. He demands you totally. That is the challenge. </div>
<div id="t9_109" class="t s1_109">Only the heart is mad enough to do that; the head is too clever. It can give a little, </div>
<div id="ta_109" class="t s1_109">but it always holds much back. It can come out a little, but the major part </div>
<div id="tb_109" class="t s1_109">remains inside: watching. seeing, calculating whether it is worth it. It is always </div>
<div id="tc_109" class="t s1_109">ready to withdraw if things go too far. </div>
<div id="td_109" class="t s1_109">People were with Jesus when he was hailed as the son of God and the multitudes </div>
<div id="te_109" class="t s1_109">were there. But when he was crucified, those masses disappeared. Nobody was </div>
<div id="tf_109" class="t s1_109">there. Only a few disciples were there, and even those disciples were hiding in </div>
<div id="tg_109" class="t s1_109">the Crowd of the enemies. When Jesus was crucified, only three women came </div>
<div id="th_109" class="t s1_109">near. That is symbolic: that only the heart can come near in such moments. </div>
<div id="ti_109" class="t s1_109">If Jesus was going to be enthroned, then all the disciples would have been near. </div>
<div id="tj_109" class="t s1_109">In fact, there would have been a great competition. They had even been asking </div>

<div id="ty_109" class="t s1_109">rushed. But nothing happened, no miracle. Jesus died like an ordinary man. </div>
<div id="tz_109" class="t s1_109">This was the miracle: that he accepted. Whatsoever the will of God was, was </div>
