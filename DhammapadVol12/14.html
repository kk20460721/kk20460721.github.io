<div id="t2_14" class="t s1_14">trembling, but it is there. </div>
<div id="t3_14" class="t s1_14">Soren Kierkegaard is one of the most important thinkers of the Western hemisphere. </div>
<div id="t4_14" class="t s1_14">What he is saying he must be saying from his own personal experience; he was very </div>
<div id="t5_14" class="t s1_14">much afraid of death. He was afraid only of two things: death and money. He never </div>
<div id="t6_14" class="t s1_14">earned anything. His father had left a certain bank balance for him; he lived on it. Each </div>
<div id="t7_14" class="t s1_14">month, on the first day, he would go to the bank and withdraw a certain amount and </div>
<div id="t8_14" class="t s1_14">live on it. He lived in a very very economical way, but he was very much afraid: sooner </div>
<div id="t9_14" class="t s1_14">or later the money was going to be finished -- that was his constant worry. People had </div>
<div id="ta_14" class="t s1_14">seen him in Copenhagen going to the bank and coming home always in a state of </div>
<div id="tb_14" class="t s1_14">trembling. </div>
<div id="tc_14" class="t s1_14">And then death... and death is certainly related to money. People who are very much </div>
<div id="td_14" class="t s1_14">afraid of death start accumulating money as a protection -- as if money can protect! </div>
<div id="te_14" class="t s1_14">People who are not afraid of death don't care much about money; they use money, but </div>
<div id="tf_14" class="t s1_14">they don't care. </div>
<div id="tg_14" class="t s1_14">And one strange thing happened: Soren Kierkegaard died on the road the day he </div>
<div id="th_14" class="t s1_14">withdrew the last amount of money from the bank. He was coming home from the </div>
<div id="ti_14" class="t s1_14">bank; this was the last amount, the bank balance was finished. The manager had said, </div>
<div id="tj_14" class="t s1_14">"Next month you need not come -- all the money is finished." He fell in the middle of </div>
<div id="tk_14" class="t s1_14">the road -- he didn't reach home -- and died then and there. If money is finished, life is </div>
<div id="tl_14" class="t s1_14">finished! He must have been a man of tremendous fear. </div>
<div id="tm_14" class="t s1_14">When he was young he loved a woman, a very beautiful woman, Regina. For three </div>
<div id="tn_14" class="t s1_14">years the love affair continued and finally, when they were going to get married, he </div>
<div id="to_14" class="t s1_14">refused. It was very strange because Regina was a beautiful woman and he was an ugly </div>
<div id="tp_14" class="t s1_14">man. If Regina had refused it would have been logical, but why did Kierkegaard refuse? </div>
<div id="tq_14" class="t s1_14">He refused out of the simple fear that "If we get married and some trouble arises, then? </div>
<div id="tr_14" class="t s1_14">If some fighting arises or if she falls in love with somebody else? -- she is such a </div>
<div id="ts_14" class="t s1_14">beautiful woman</div>
<div id="tt_14" class="t s1_14">....</div>
<div id="tu_14" class="t s1_14">" Afraid of the possibilities of the future, he simply refused. He </div>
<div id="tv_14" class="t s1_14">refused to live! He never left the city, he was so afraid of accidents. So when he says </div>
<div id="tw_14" class="t s1_14">man is a trembling he is saying it from personal experience. </div>
<div id="tx_14" class="t s1_14">Buddha says: The master does not tremble. All his trembling disappears because he </div>
<div id="ty_14" class="t s1_14">knows there is no death. Knowing himself he has transcended death. He has no fear of </div>
<div id="tz_14" class="t s1_14">the future because he lives in the present. He is not possessive; hence nothing can be </div>
<div id="t10_14" class="t s1_14">taken away from him. </div>
<div id="t11_14" class="t s1_14">NOTHING BINDS HIM. </div>
<div id="t12_14" class="t s1_14">HE IS INFINITELY FREE. </div>
<div id="t13_14" class="t s1_14">Because he is nonpossessive, NOTHING BINDS HIM. He is freedom, absolute freedom. </div>
