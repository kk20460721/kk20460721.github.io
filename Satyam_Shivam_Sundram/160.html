<div id="t1_160" class="t s1_160">CHAPTER 14. NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND A COWARDLY SOUL</div>
<div id="t2_160" class="t s2_160">That was their calculation, that the case would take at least that much time; not before ﬁve would</div>
<div id="t3_160" class="t s2_160">the court decide. And after the court’s decision my ﬁne had to be ﬁled and only when my ﬁne was</div>
<div id="t4_160" class="t s2_160">paid, would I be allowed to be taken to the jail. So they had calculated perfectly – nearabout six I</div>
<div id="t5_160" class="t s2_160">would come back to take my clothes.</div>
<div id="t6_160" class="t s2_160">But because there was no trial... The government was not ready to go for a trial, knowing perfectly</div>
<div id="t7_160" class="t s2_160">well that they didn’t have any evidence against me. They had seen the same government attorney</div>
<div id="t8_160" class="t s2_160">general who was ﬁghting for three days in the court of North Carolina conclude his speech, ”We</div>
<div id="t9_160" class="t s2_160">don’t have any evidence against him.” Now, what more they could do?</div>
<div id="ta_160" class="t s2_160">It was absolutely clear that if they went for trial they would be defeated. And they told my attorneys,</div>
<div id="tb_160" class="t s2_160">”You should remember one thing: the case you can win, but it may take ten years or twenty years;</div>
<div id="tc_160" class="t s2_160">we can go on postponing it. And the second thing you should remember is that the government of</div>
<div id="td_160" class="t s2_160">the United States of America is not going to be defeated by a single individual. If you are interested</div>
<div id="te_160" class="t s2_160">in saving Osho’s life, it is better not to go for a trial.”</div>
<div id="tf_160" class="t s2_160">That’s why the case was ﬁnished within two minutes. I reached the jail too early... In the waiting</div>
<div id="tg_160" class="t s2_160">room where they were going to deliver me my clothes, there was only one man, and he was shaky.</div>
<div id="th_160" class="t s2_160">The form in his hand showed that his whole being was shaking. I asked him, ”Something is wrong</div>
<div id="ti_160" class="t s2_160">with your hand? – or something is wrong with the form?”</div>
<div id="tj_160" class="t s2_160">He said, ”You sit on this seat, and just wait. It will take ten or ﬁfteen minutes for me to get my boss’s</div>
<div id="tk_160" class="t s2_160">signature on the form – which was an absolute lie, because there was no place on the form where</div>
<div id="tl_160" class="t s2_160">anybody else’s signature was needed. It was a simple form saying that I had received my clothes</div>
<div id="tm_160" class="t s2_160">back. Only my signature was needed.</div>
<div id="tn_160" class="t s2_160">When he went out, locking the door from outside, he indicated the chair on which I had to sit. That</div>
<div id="to_160" class="t s2_160">was the same chair under which the bomb was found. Perhaps he had gone to ask what had to be</div>
<div id="tp_160" class="t s2_160">done now, because he may not have been aware what the decision in the court had been. If I was</div>
<div id="tq_160" class="t s2_160">released, then there was no need to explode the bomb; if I was going for trial, then it was better to</div>
<div id="tr_160" class="t s2_160">ﬁnish it on the ﬁrst day. Why wait unnecessarily for years of trial and millions of dollars to be wasted?</div>
<div id="ts_160" class="t s2_160">Looking at the police department’s report, it is absolutely clear that now they are trying to make it</div>
<div id="tt_160" class="t s2_160">simply a rumor. But if it was a rumor, why did they evacuate the prison? And if they believed in the</div>
<div id="tu_160" class="t s2_160">rumor and evacuated the prison, they should not have taken me in there. It is so clear</div>
<div id="tv_160" class="t s2_160">....</div>
<div id="tw_160" class="t s2_160">So what</div>
<div id="tx_160" class="t s2_160">they have been doing for investigation is ﬁnding out who phoned. They found out the locality from</div>
<div id="ty_160" class="t s2_160">where the call had come, but in that locality there are many people and many phones. That is the</div>
<div id="tz_160" class="t s2_160">end of the street. The investigation has stopped. Where to go from there?</div>
<div id="t10_160" class="t s2_160">Even a certain belief in an anonymous phonecall was stupid, because the jail was so secure and</div>
<div id="t11_160" class="t s2_160">safe; it was perhaps the most modern jail in America. It opened only three months before I entered</div>
<div id="t12_160" class="t s2_160">it.</div>
<div id="t13_160" class="t s2_160">It has all the latest security equipment – doors which open only with remote control buttons;</div>
<div id="t14_160" class="t s2_160">nobody can open them by hand. And there were doors beyond doors... as far as I remember, there</div>
<div id="t15_160" class="t s2_160">were three doors through which they took me in.</div>
<div id="t16_160" class="t s2_160">Just inside the car they had the remote controller, and the ﬁrst gate would open. The gate was a</div>
<div id="t17_160" class="t s2_160">solid steel rock rising up just to give space for the car to move in. Then there was the second gate,</div>
<div id="t18_160" class="t s2_160">Satyam Shivam Sundram</div>
<div id="t19_160" class="t s2_160">160</div>
<div id="t1a_160" class="t s3_160">Osho</div>
