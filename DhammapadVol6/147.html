<div id="t3_147" class="t s1_147">Intelligence is part of wisdom, intellectuality is part of knowledge. </div>
<div id="t4_147" class="t s1_147">Yes, Sargam, I speak against knowledge because there is nothing more dangerous than </div>
<div id="t5_147" class="t s1_147">knowledge. It hinders you from knowing yourself. Knowledge hinders you from </div>
<div id="t6_147" class="t s1_147">knowing, because it gives you plastic, synthetic, false things to play with and you forget </div>
<div id="t7_147" class="t s1_147">all about the real thing. Don't start believing in words; it is the most dangerous game </div>
<div id="t8_147" class="t s1_147">one can play. Don't be a parrot, otherwise you will be going farther and farther away </div>
<div id="t9_147" class="t s1_147">from your inner source. </div>
<div id="ta_147" class="t s1_147">One very hot day a dog was walking along a road when he saw a take-away food shop. </div>
<div id="tb_147" class="t s1_147">He went in and asked for a can of lemonade. </div>
<div id="tc_147" class="t s1_147">"Get out!" said the shopkeeper. "Dogs are not allowed in food shops." </div>
<div id="td_147" class="t s1_147">"But look here," said the thirsty canine, "you've got a big sign outside that says, WE </div>
<div id="te_147" class="t s1_147">SERVE HOT DOGS!" </div>
<div id="tf_147" class="t s1_147">Just knowing the words is not enough. And the more words you know, the more </div>
<div id="tg_147" class="t s1_147">confused you are going to become, because you don't know, your words are just on the </div>
<div id="th_147" class="t s1_147">surface. If somebody scratches a little bit more, your ignorance is bound to show. </div>
<div id="ti_147" class="t s1_147">People go on pretending. </div>
<div id="tj_147" class="t s1_147">When I was a student in the university, I had a professor who was not even very </div>
<div id="tk_147" class="t s1_147">knowledgeable -- wisdom was out of the question. But he had this habit of pretending. </div>
<div id="tl_147" class="t s1_147">Whenever anybody would mention any name of a philosopher, author, poet, mystic or </div>
<div id="tm_147" class="t s1_147">a name of some book, he would immediately say, "Yes, I have read the book, it is </div>
<div id="tn_147" class="t s1_147">beautiful," or this or that, he would make some comment. But I could see in his eyes </div>
<div id="to_147" class="t s1_147">that the answer he was giving was hollow, he had not read the book, he knows nothing </div>
<div id="tp_147" class="t s1_147">about the person and nobody had ever seen him in the library. I had gone to his house </div>
<div id="tq_147" class="t s1_147">also, and I had not seen any books there. I inquired in the library -- he had been in the </div>
<div id="tr_147" class="t s1_147">university for ten years -- not a single book had been taken out in his name, and nobody </div>
<div id="ts_147" class="t s1_147">had ever seen him reading, except the newspaper. He was not reading anything else, </div>
<div id="tt_147" class="t s1_147">and that too, he used to borrow from the neighbors. I inquired everywhere, and I </div>
<div id="tu_147" class="t s1_147">became absolutely certain that he was simply pretending. </div>
<div id="tv_147" class="t s1_147">One day I invented three names, just invented. I told him, "Have you read, sir, </div>
<div id="tw_147" class="t s1_147">Nomineo's book?" </div>
<div id="tx_147" class="t s1_147">He said, "Yes." Now, there is no person like Nomineo</div>
<div id="ty_147" class="t s1_147">....</div>
<div id="tz_147" class="t s1_147">I asked him, "Can you tell me the name of his book?" </div>
<div id="t10_147" class="t s1_147">He looked a little puzzled; he said, "I must have read it many years ago, I have </div>
<div id="t11_147" class="t s1_147">forgotten the name. You can inquire in the library." </div>
<div id="t12_147" class="t s1_147">I said, "You come along." In the library there was no name like Nomineo and no book </div>
<div id="t13_147" class="t s1_147">he had written, because he has never been -- so how could he write a book? </div>
<div id="t14_147" class="t s1_147">I told him, "The other two names were also inventions and you have agreed, and a few </div>
<div id="t15_147" class="t s1_147">other books also you have agreed that you read -- they don't exist!" </div>
