<div id="t1_81" class="t s1_81">CHAPTER 8. THE DECISIVE MOMENT IS AT HAND</div>
<div id="t2_81" class="t s2_81">Two persons while meditating, went all naked.” He said it rather lovingly: that some people were</div>
<div id="t3_81" class="t s2_81">upset because two persons had shed their clothes, and so I should restrain them.</div>
<div id="t4_81" class="t s2_81">Every one is naked behind his clothes and no one gets upset about it. Inside our clothes all of us are</div>
<div id="t5_81" class="t s2_81">naked and no one is disturbed. But everyone is disturbed because two persons shed their clothes</div>
<div id="t6_81" class="t s2_81">during meditation. It is a great irony. It would be understandable if someone had disrobed you and</div>
<div id="t7_81" class="t s2_81">you got upset. But why are you upset about someone shedding his own clothes? It was okay to be</div>
<div id="t8_81" class="t s2_81">upset if someone had robbed you of your clothes, although that too would be meaningless. Jesus</div>
<div id="t9_81" class="t s2_81">has said, ”If someone deprives you of your coat, give him your shirt too. Maybe, he could not take</div>
<div id="ta_81" class="t s2_81">more because of his shyness.” His protest was justiﬁed if someone had removed his coat. But why</div>
<div id="tb_81" class="t s2_81">should he lose his head if someone takes off his own coat? It seems that he was just waiting for an</div>
<div id="tc_81" class="t s2_81">opportunity when someone took off his coat and he slackened his efforts and put all the blame on</div>
<div id="td_81" class="t s2_81">him.</div>
<div id="te_81" class="t s2_81">It is amazing how somebody going naked should disturb your meditation, unless you are closely</div>
<div id="tf_81" class="t s2_81">watching him doing so. Were you meditating or what? In fact, you should not know who sheds his</div>
<div id="tg_81" class="t s2_81">clothes and what is happening around you. You have to do your meditation and remain conﬁned to</div>
<div id="th_81" class="t s2_81">yourself. Or should you be interested in what others do? Are you a washerman or a tailor that you</div>
<div id="ti_81" class="t s2_81">take so much interest in others’ clothes? Your worries are baseless and meaningless.</div>
<div id="tj_81" class="t s2_81">And one who sheds his clothes... just think of it. You will know it if you are asked to strip yourself</div>
<div id="tk_81" class="t s2_81">of your clothes.</div>
<div id="tl_81" class="t s2_81">Then you will know that one had some great reasons for shedding his clothes;</div>
<div id="tm_81" class="t s2_81">something must have happened to him to do so. Perhaps you will not do it even if one offers you a</div>
<div id="tn_81" class="t s2_81">hundred thousand rupees in reward. And this person has shed his clothes without any such offer,</div>
<div id="to_81" class="t s2_81">and you are unnecessarily upset. Some strong reason must have arisen which prompted him to do</div>
<div id="tp_81" class="t s2_81">so. We have not yet learned to see and understand life with sympathy and care.</div>
<div id="tq_81" class="t s2_81">When Mahavira shed his clothes for the ﬁrst time, he was received with bricks and rocks. And now</div>
<div id="tr_81" class="t s2_81">he is worshipped. And those who worship him are selling clothes all over. The followers of Mahavira</div>
<div id="ts_81" class="t s2_81">are all cloth merchants.</div>
<div id="tt_81" class="t s2_81">This is so strange.</div>
<div id="tu_81" class="t s2_81">And it must have been these very people who had</div>
<div id="tv_81" class="t s2_81">hurled rocks on him.</div>
<div id="tw_81" class="t s2_81">And to atone for it they are now selling clothes so that no one is driven to</div>
<div id="tx_81" class="t s2_81">be naked. Cloth merchants are followers of Mahavira who himself lived naked. When he shed his</div>
<div id="ty_81" class="t s2_81">clothes, he was driven out of village after village. Not one village gave him shelter. Wherever he</div>
<div id="tz_81" class="t s2_81">went, he was chased away because he was naked. And now he is adorned and worshipped – he</div>
<div id="t10_81" class="t s2_81">who was refused shelter – not only in a village or an inn, he was not allowed to take shelter even in</div>
<div id="t11_81" class="t s2_81">a cremation ground which lay outside the village and where dead bodies were burned. Wild dogs</div>
<div id="t12_81" class="t s2_81">were let loose on him so that he did not come near a village. What was it that troubled the people?</div>
<div id="t13_81" class="t s2_81">Nothing except that Mahavira had discarded his clothes.</div>
<div id="t14_81" class="t s2_81">It is amazing that merely discarding of clothes on the part of one should... What can be the reason?</div>
<div id="t15_81" class="t s2_81">What is the fear behind it? The fear is really terrible. We are so naked inside, we are so utterly</div>
<div id="t16_81" class="t s2_81">degraded and poor in our beings, that the sight of a naked mall – nakedness is closely associated</div>
<div id="t17_81" class="t s2_81">with poverty and squalor – reminds us of our own inner degradation and poverty. There is no other</div>
<div id="t18_81" class="t s2_81">reason than this.</div>
<div id="t19_81" class="t s2_81">And remember, nudity is one thing and naked ness quite another. Looking at Mahavira no one can</div>
<div id="t1a_81" class="t s2_81">say that he is naked, he looks so beautiful. And so far as we are concerned we look naked and ugly</div>
<div id="t1b_81" class="t s2_81">even in the best of our garments.</div>
<div id="t1c_81" class="t s2_81">In Search of the Miraculous Vol 1</div>
<div id="t1d_81" class="t s2_81">81</div>
