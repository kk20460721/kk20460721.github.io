<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">cleaning, you need a total unburdening of the heart. Only then, in that silence, will you </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">be able to understand. </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">Buddha says: </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">HOW CAN A TROUBLED MIND </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">UNDERSTAND THE WAY? </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">Thousands had gathered around Buddha, just as you have gathered around me -- </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">thousands of seekers had come to Buddha and they were asking all kinds of questions. </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">And Buddha was not interested in their questions at all; he was not interested in </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">answering them. He was interested, certainly, in showing them the way, but the </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">problem was that they were so much troubled with their questions AND the answers </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">that they had collected, they were so much disturbed by all the knowledge that they </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">had been carrying all along, that it was impossible, almost completely impossible to </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">show them the way. Hence this sutra: HOW CAN A TROUBLED MIND </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">UNDERSTAND THE WAY? </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">So rather than giving them more answers, more explanations, more knowledge, Buddha </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">started taking away their knowledge, their ready-made answers, their a priori </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">conceptions, their prejudices. India has never been able to forgive Buddha for that. </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">Immediately after he died the traditional mind of this country started uprooting all the </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">plants that he had planted; all the rosebushes were burned. Buddha was completely </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">thrown out of this country. The greatest son of this land had no shelter here; the </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">teaching had to seek shelter in foreign lands. </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">This is not accidental, this has happened always. Jesus was condemned by the Jews, </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">crucified by the Jews, and Jesus was the greatest Jew who has ever been on the earth, </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">the greatest flowering of the Jewish consciousness, the uttermost expression, the </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">crescendo, the Everest. But why did the Jews deny him? They should have been happy, </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">they should have danced and celebrated, but they could not -- they could not forgive </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">him, because his presence made them feel very mediocre; that was his crime. He had to </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">be punished for it, for being so high, for being so beyond, for being so superior, for </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">being so graceful, for bringing such love. For his presence he had to be punished, </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">because his presence was making people feel ugly by comparison. He had to be </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">removed so the mediocre mind could feel at ease. </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">Jesus was not killed by Jews, he was killed by the mediocre mind. It happened to be the </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">Jewish mediocre mind in the case of Jesus. The same happened with Buddha. Buddha </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">has not been forgiven by the Hindus, and he was the greatest Hindu ever. He was the </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">purest Hindu possible, the very quintessence of Hinduism. What the Upanishads were </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">saying, he had actualized it. He was the realization of the deepest longings of this land, </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">but he was uprooted from here, he was thrown out of here. </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">Buddhism disappeared from India, not even a trace was left behind -- utterly washed </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">away. Why? He was tremendously respected in Tibet, in China, in Korea, in Japan, in </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">Thailand, in Burma, in Sri Lanka. The whole of Asia loved the man, so unique is his </div>
