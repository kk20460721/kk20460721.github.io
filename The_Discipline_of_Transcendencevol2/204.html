<div id="t14_204" class="t s1_204">love... Like a rose flower or a dewdrop. Their strength is very fragile, vulnerable. </div>
<div id="t15_204" class="t s1_204">Their strength is the strength of life not of death. Their power is not of that which </div>
<div id="t16_204" class="t s1_204">kills; their power is of that which creates. Their power is not of violence, </div>
<div id="t17_204" class="t s1_204">aggression; their power is that of compassion. </div>
