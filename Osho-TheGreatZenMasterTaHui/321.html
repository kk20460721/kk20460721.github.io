<div id="t1_321" class="t s1_321">He said, "Right, absolutely right. You have got the point. I will never ask anything and</div>
<div id="t2_321" class="t s1_321">never say anything. You are always welcome; there is no need to go through any social ritual.</div>
<div id="t3_321" class="t s1_321">You can simply come and rest, sit."</div>
<div id="t4_321" class="t s1_321">We became friendly. He was living in poverty, but he was immensely happy. He said, "I</div>
<div id="t5_321" class="t s1_321">always wanted to be a flute player, never to be a professor. Just my parents forced me ... but</div>
<div id="t6_321" class="t s1_321">thanks to God the college people expelled me. Now I am absolutely free, and because people</div>
<div id="t7_321" class="t s1_321">think I am mad nobody bothers me. I play my flute, I write songs ..."</div>
<div id="t8_321" class="t s1_321">He has translated into Hindi the poetry of Omar Khayyam. There are at least a dozen Hindi</div>
<div id="t9_321" class="t s1_321">translations of the poetry of Omar Khayyam -- some done by great poets -- but none comes</div>
<div id="ta_321" class="t s1_321">even close to his. And he lived a life of anonymity. It was I who insisted that his book should</div>
<div id="tb_321" class="t s1_321">be published.</div>
<div id="tc_321" class="t s1_321">He said, "Who is going to listen to me? I am a madman."</div>
<div id="td_321" class="t s1_321">I said, "Don't be worried. I will approach publishers and I will not mention your name in</div>
<div id="te_321" class="t s1_321">the beginning. First let them see the manuscript -- because there are so many translations, but</div>
<div id="tf_321" class="t s1_321">your translation is not only a translation but in some way an improvement."</div>
<div id="tg_321" class="t s1_321">I have read Kahlil Gibran, I have read Omar Khayyam. He was interested in these two men</div>
<div id="th_321" class="t s1_321">and was slowly, whenever he had time, translating them. But I told him, "No translation</div>
<div id="ti_321" class="t s1_321">comes close to yours, and listening to you singing Omar Khayyam I sometimes feel perhaps</div>
<div id="tj_321" class="t s1_321">the original Omar Khayyam does not have that quality, that much poetry, because he was not</div>
<div id="tk_321" class="t s1_321">an insane man; he was a mathematician." Now, one cannot hope for a mathematician to write</div>
<div id="tl_321" class="t s1_321">great poetry. These are opposite poles, poetry and mathematics -- what do they have in</div>
<div id="tm_321" class="t s1_321">common?</div>
<div id="tn_321" class="t s1_321">Finally I persuaded a publisher ... because he was also amazed and he was continuously</div>
<div id="to_321" class="t s1_321">asking who the translator was. When he was absolutely convinced that this was the best</div>
<div id="tp_321" class="t s1_321">translation, then I told him the name. He said, "My God, but I used to think he is a madman."</div>
<div id="tq_321" class="t s1_321">I said, "In this insane world, to be sane is to be mad. He is not insane at all, but he enjoys</div>
<div id="tr_321" class="t s1_321">this idea that people have forgotten about him. Now nobody expects anything from him,</div>
<div id="ts_321" class="t s1_321">nobody expects that he should behave in a certain way. He has attained freedom by being</div>
<div id="tt_321" class="t s1_321">condemned as a madman. He is completely at ease with himself, he goes on doing his own</div>
<div id="tu_321" class="t s1_321">thing and he is immensely happy."</div>
<div id="tv_321" class="t s1_321">This man died very soon after. Perhaps he was poor and he could not afford medicine -- he</div>
<div id="tw_321" class="t s1_321">had tuberculosis -- but he died so peacefully and so joyously ... singing a song of Omar</div>
<div id="tx_321" class="t s1_321">Khayyam. I was present when he died. The song that he sang last says ... in Hindi, just as in</div>
<div id="ty_321" class="t s1_321">English or Arabic, the body is called the earth. The word 'human' comes from humus, and</div>
<div id="tz_321" class="t s1_321">humus means mud. The word 'adami' or 'adam' comes also from mud.</div>
<div id="t10_321" class="t s1_321">The song that he was singing and died singing was, "When I die, don't take my body to the</div>
<div id="t11_321" class="t s1_321">funeral or to the cemetery. The earth in my body belongs to the pub" -- he was a drunkard --</div>
<div id="t12_321" class="t s1_321">"so please let my body be put in a grave inside the pub. I will be dead but others who will be</div>
<div id="t13_321" class="t s1_321">alive ... if they can just drop a few drops of wine over my grave, that will be enough</div>
<div id="t14_321" class="t s1_321">satisfaction for me."</div>
<div id="t15_321" class="t s1_321">You would not call him a saint, you would not call him religious -- he was not, but he</div>
<div id="t16_321" class="t s1_321">lived a life of utter simplicity, of tremendous beauty. He never harmed anybody, and there was</div>
<div id="t17_321" class="t s1_321">a shine in his eyes because he knows something which other people don't know.</div>
<div id="t18_321" class="t s1_321">Chapter 27 - Just being</div>
