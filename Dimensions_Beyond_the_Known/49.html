<div id="t1_49" class="t s1_49">CHAPTER 3.</div>
<div id="t2_49" class="t s2_49">enduring appeal, because people are weary of that which is old. A new situation has been created</div>
<div id="t3_49" class="t s2_49">in which people are growing weary even of that which is new. The new was always thought to be</div>
<div id="t4_49" class="t s2_49">the opposite of the old, but now we are standing at a point from where it can be clearly seen that the</div>
<div id="t5_49" class="t s2_49">new is only the beginning of the old. The new means that which will become old. No sooner do we</div>
<div id="t6_49" class="t s2_49">begin explaining something as new when the thing begins to become old. Now there is no attraction</div>
<div id="t7_49" class="t s2_49">to the new, and we have always had a revulsion for the old.</div>
<div id="t8_49" class="t s2_49">There was a time when there was an attraction for the old. This attraction was deep. The older</div>
<div id="t9_49" class="t s2_49">a thing, the more valuable it was thought to be. If it had passed through experience, if it was well</div>
<div id="ta_49" class="t s2_49">examined, there was no fear in following it, and one had full faith in it. So many people had walked</div>
<div id="tb_49" class="t s2_49">on such an old path and so many had reached by that path, that new travelers could even walk with</div>
<div id="tc_49" class="t s2_49">closed eyes if they wanted to. There was a road for the blind also. There was no need for anyone to</div>
<div id="td_49" class="t s2_49">doubt very much, think very much, search very much or decide very much.</div>
<div id="te_49" class="t s2_49">And it is very difﬁcult to decide about the unknown. However much you may doubt, in the end the</div>
<div id="tf_49" class="t s2_49">jump into the unknown is only through trust, because doubt can, at the most, take you up to the</div>
<div id="tg_49" class="t s2_49">point of some trust through which in the end you can jump. But that attraction for antiquity is lost,</div>
<div id="th_49" class="t s2_49">and it has become lost for several reasons.</div>
<div id="ti_49" class="t s2_49">The ﬁrst reason is that when a person knew only one tradition, there was no difﬁculty. But when one</div>
<div id="tj_49" class="t s2_49">person came to know about several traditions, difﬁculties arose. There was a time when a Hindu</div>
<div id="tk_49" class="t s2_49">born into a Hindu family was brought up solely in Hindu surroundings and near a Hindu temple.</div>
<div id="tl_49" class="t s2_49">The sound of the bells of the Hindu temple had become associated with the mother’s milk and had</div>
<div id="tm_49" class="t s2_49">become part of his bloodstream. Thus, the presiding deity in the temple was as much a part of his</div>
<div id="tn_49" class="t s2_49">bones, blood and ﬂesh as were the air, the water and the nearby mountain.</div>
<div id="to_49" class="t s2_49">There were no rivals. There was no church, no mosque. No sound of any other tradition fell into his</div>
<div id="tp_49" class="t s2_49">ears and mind. The old was so much in existence that it could not be questioned. It had existed</div>
<div id="tq_49" class="t s2_49">long before him, and he grew up with it and within it. But then, slowly, a mosque came up near the</div>
<div id="tr_49" class="t s2_49">temple and a church and a gurudwara also followed.</div>
<div id="ts_49" class="t s2_49">At one time, tradition had an impact on everyone, but now confusion is natural.</div>
<div id="tt_49" class="t s2_49">Nothing can be</div>
<div id="tu_49" class="t s2_49">accepted without suspicion because opposing thoughts exist side by side. If the temple is calling</div>
<div id="tv_49" class="t s2_49">you by its ringing bells, the nearby call for prayers from a mosque simultaneously tells you not to</div>
<div id="tw_49" class="t s2_49">make the mistake of going to the temple. Then both of these concepts enter the mind simultaneously.</div>
<div id="tx_49" class="t s2_49">The basic reason for the increase in skepticism in the world is not an increase in man’s intelligence.</div>
<div id="ty_49" class="t s2_49">Man is only as intelligent as he ever was. The main reason for the increase in skepticism is the</div>
<div id="tz_49" class="t s2_49">superimposition of the impressions of many traditions at once upon his intellect – particularly those</div>
<div id="t10_49" class="t s2_49">of contradictory cultures.</div>
<div id="t11_49" class="t s2_49">Every path will call the other wrong. This is due to helplessness. It is not because the other path</div>
<div id="t12_49" class="t s2_49">is actually wrong. Nevertheless, it will have to be called wrong, because if the other path cannot be</div>
<div id="t13_49" class="t s2_49">called wrong, then the strength behind calling one’s own path right is broken. In fact, if one claims</div>
<div id="t14_49" class="t s2_49">that he is right, it invariably follows that the other is wrong.</div>
<div id="t15_49" class="t s2_49">Every tradition, therefore, had its own path. These paths never met or crossed each other but simply</div>
<div id="t16_49" class="t s2_49">ran parallel; all traditions ﬂowed separately in their own course. In that situation, in that period of</div>
<div id="t17_49" class="t s2_49">Dimensions Beyond the Known</div>
<div id="t18_49" class="t s2_49">49</div>
<div id="t19_49" class="t s3_49">Osho</div>
