<div id="t2_59" class="t s2_59">for his hat, put his hat on a very beautiful red hat – took his cigar in one hand, a cup of coffee in the</div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s2_59">other hand, smoked and sipped the coffee.’</div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s2_59">The doctor was watching and the disciples were crying and weeping, and the doctor knew that</div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s2_59">within seconds Gurdjieff was going to disappear. His legs had become numb – they had gathered</div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s2_59">too much water and the water had to be removed – and the doctor knew that he might not even</div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s2_59">be able to completely remove the water because before the water was removed, Gurdjieff would be</div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s2_59">gone. And he asked Gurdjieff – -because giving him pain seemed unnecessary now that he was</div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s2_59">going to die; death was certain – he asked Gurdjieff ’What should I do?’</div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s2_59">And Gurdjieff said ’If you are tired, then I can wait a little longer. I have been waiting so many years</div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s2_59">for death. You can rest a little and then you can do it. I have been waiting so long, I can wait a</div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s2_59">little longer – there is no problem. If you are too tired, you can have a little rest – two, three hours –</div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s2_59">because you have not been asleep the whole night. If you are not tired, you do your work.’</div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s2_59">Crying, because he also was a disciple, the doctor started taking water out of his legs. And Gurdjieff</div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s2_59">was there, sipping his coffee and smoking his cigar and talking and joking. All life had disappeared</div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s2_59">from the body, but his face was aﬂame, his eyes were so radiant. And at the last moment he said</div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s2_59">’Has anybody any question? because now I am leaving.’</div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s2_59">He used to say to his disciples that one can die very consciously, and he died very consciously. Just</div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s2_59">twenty-four hours before he was removed to the hospital he insisted that he would not go to the</div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s2_59">hospital, and he asked the doctor ’What do you think? Can the hospital save me? If I cannot save</div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s2_59">myself then who can save me?’ For twenty-four hours before this, the doctor had been crying, so he</div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s2_59">said ’Okay, if you are crying, I am coming.’</div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s2_59">So the doctor ran outside to phone for the ambulance. And when the ambulance came, he went into</div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s2_59">the room – Gurdjieff had disappeared! He could not believe how he had gone because he could not</div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s2_59">move!</div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s2_59">Gurdjieff was standing on the road near the ambulance. He came in and he said ’The ambulance</div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s2_59">has come – where is the doctor?’</div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s2_59">He was walking and the doctor could not believe it – it was</div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s2_59">impossible, he was not in a state to walk. Other doctors came to consult and they, nobody, could</div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s2_59">believe that he could walk, but he walked to the ambulance.</div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s2_59">Not only that, he came in again to</div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s2_59">enquire ’Where is the doctor?’</div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s2_59">Two weeks before, suddenly – and he was ill, very ill – one evening he asked his disciples ’Bring my</div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s2_59">car, I would like to drive.’ Two weeks before!</div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s2_59">And they said ’The doctor says you should not move out of the bed.’</div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s2_59">He said ’Forget all about doctors. Bring my car.’ And he drove the car and went to a certain Russian</div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s2_59">church and there sat for one hour, with closed eyes, under a tree. Only later on could people know</div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s2_59">that was the place where he would be buried two weeks later. He had gone there two weeks before</div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s2_59">to see the place, and he sat on the exact place where he was to be buried two weeks later. And</div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s2_59">then they all understood: death was so clear to him – when it was going to happen, where he was</div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s2_59">going to be buried – and that was a church he had never gone to in his whole life. It was not that he</div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s2_59">used to visit it; he had never gone. That was the ﬁrst and the last time alive. Next time he was dead.</div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s2_59">Tao: The Pathless Path, Vol 1</div>
