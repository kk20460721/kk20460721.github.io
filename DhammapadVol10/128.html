<div id="t2_128" class="t s1_128">intelligence. </div>
<div id="t3_128" class="t s1_128">And that's how this sutra has been interpreted down the ages, for the simple reason that </div>
<div id="t4_128" class="t s1_128">destruction is easier; any stupid person can do it. And your so-called saints are almost </div>
<div id="t5_128" class="t s1_128">always stupid. It is very rare to come across a real saint who is a creative person. They </div>
<div id="t6_128" class="t s1_128">are worshipped as saints because they have been successfully committing suicide -- </div>
<div id="t7_128" class="t s1_128">slow suicide, of course -- destroying themselves slowly, poisoning themselves slowly. </div>
<div id="t8_128" class="t s1_128">We have worshipped death, destruction. We should learn -- it is time now -- we should </div>
<div id="t9_128" class="t s1_128">learn to love life and to love creativity, creation. </div>
<div id="ta_128" class="t s1_128">MY understanding of this sutra is totally different. "Master your senses" means become </div>
<div id="tb_128" class="t s1_128">more conscious of your senses, become more sensitive. Don't destroy them; otherwise </div>
<div id="tc_128" class="t s1_128">you will be left without the doors and windows into creation, into God, into truth. </div>
<div id="td_128" class="t s1_128">There is a story of a Hindu mystic. I don't believe that it is true because I have been </div>
<div id="te_128" class="t s1_128">deeply impressed by that mystic's great sayings; they are so beautiful that it is </div>
<div id="tf_128" class="t s1_128">impossible for me to conceive that he could have done such a thing. </div>
<div id="tg_128" class="t s1_128">Surdas is his name. He was a blind man, not born blind; that's how the story goes. He </div>
<div id="th_128" class="t s1_128">destroyed his eyes himself because he saw a beautiful woman and became fascinated by </div>
<div id="ti_128" class="t s1_128">her. She took his fancy, he started thinking of her -- and he was a monk. He destroyed </div>
<div id="tj_128" class="t s1_128">his eyes because he thought it was these two eyes that had made him aware of her </div>
<div id="tk_128" class="t s1_128">beauty. If these eyes were not there, he would not have been infatuated. </div>
<div id="tl_128" class="t s1_128">I don't believe the story, but it is true of thousands of other people. My own experience </div>
<div id="tm_128" class="t s1_128">is that Surdas must have been blind from the very beginning because his insight in his </div>
<div id="tn_128" class="t s1_128">poetry is such that it is inconceivable that such a man will do such a stupid act. </div>
<div id="to_128" class="t s1_128">By destroying your eyes you cannot get freedom from women or from men. You can </div>
<div id="tp_128" class="t s1_128">close your eyes, that will not make much difference. In fact with closed eyes women </div>
<div id="tq_128" class="t s1_128">appear more beautiful than they are! </div>
<div id="tr_128" class="t s1_128">That's why whenever you make love to a woman she closes her eyes; you appear more </div>
<div id="ts_128" class="t s1_128">beautiful. Otherwise, looking at you she will become afraid, because on your face the </div>
<div id="tt_128" class="t s1_128">expression of passion and lust can't be described as beautiful; it is ugly, it is animal. A </div>
<div id="tu_128" class="t s1_128">man full of lust is nothing but an animal. Women must have learned the art of closing </div>
<div id="tv_128" class="t s1_128">their eyes seeing again and again that the man turns into an animal. </div>
<div id="tw_128" class="t s1_128">I love a famous Zen anecdote: </div>
<div id="tx_128" class="t s1_128">Two monks were coming back to the monastery; they had gone into the village to </div>
<div id="ty_128" class="t s1_128">preach. It was evening, the sun was setting; soon it would be night. They came across a </div>
<div id="tz_128" class="t s1_128">river. A young woman, a beautiful woman, was standing there on the bank hesitating </div>
<div id="t10_128" class="t s1_128">whether to enter the river or not: it may be too deep, it appears very deep. </div>
<div id="t11_128" class="t s1_128">The first monk -- the older one -- followed the Buddhist rule not to look at a woman. </div>
<div id="t12_128" class="t s1_128">But that is a very strange rule: first you have to look, then only will you be able to see </div>
<div id="t13_128" class="t s1_128">whether she is a woman or not. You can follow the rule only by breaking it! So he must </div>
