<div id="t2_49" class="t s1_49">people are doing. Somebody is rushing after women, then one day he decides it </div>
<div id="t3_49" class="t s1_49">is futile; he starts running away from women. But running continues. First he </div>
<div id="t4_49" class="t s1_49">was chasing, now he's afraid some woman may be chasing him. And that's how </div>
<div id="t5_49" class="t s1_49">it happens: if you chase a woman, she runs. If you start running from her, she </div>
<div id="t6_49" class="t s1_49">starts chasing you. Life is very mysterious... but the running continues. It is a </div>
<div id="t7_49" class="t s1_49">game. Only one can be the chaser and one has to be the chased. Either you are </div>
<div id="t8_49" class="t s1_49">the chaser or the woman becomes the chaser, but the game continues. </div>
<div id="t9_49" class="t s1_49">Buddha says: Stop in the middle. </div>
<div id="ta_49" class="t s1_49">This sutra is part of a very famous story in Buddha's life The story is about a </div>
<div id="tb_49" class="t s1_49">prince named Srona. </div>
<div id="tc_49" class="t s1_49">Srona was a very rich prince, and he lived the life of a super-Epicurean: eat, </div>
<div id="td_49" class="t s1_49">drink, be merry. He had lived as deeply in indulgence as possible. He had never </div>
<div id="te_49" class="t s1_49">known anything about discipline, he had never heard anything about awareness. </div>
<div id="tf_49" class="t s1_49">Women, wine -- that was all, that was his whole life... confined to two words: </div>
<div id="tg_49" class="t s1_49">women and wine. The whole day he was drunk, and the whole night he was </div>
<div id="th_49" class="t s1_49">indulging in sexuality. He was a maniac. But by and by the extreme started tiring </div>
<div id="ti_49" class="t s1_49">him. By and by he became alert to what he was doing to his life. </div>
<div id="tj_49" class="t s1_49">When you indulge too much, one day, if you are a little intelligent, you start </div>
<div id="tk_49" class="t s1_49">feeling the whole futility of it. </div>
<div id="tl_49" class="t s1_49">One day when Buddha was passing through his town, he heard about Buddha. </div>
<div id="tm_49" class="t s1_49">He had been thinking for many days, "There must be another way of life, and </div>
<div id="tn_49" class="t s1_49">there must be more to life than the way I am living it." Hearing that Buddha had </div>
<div id="to_49" class="t s1_49">come, he went to see him. He was an extremist. Seeing Buddha -- his silence, his </div>
<div id="tp_49" class="t s1_49">grace, his peace -- he was touched. His heart was overwhelmed. He bowed down </div>
<div id="tq_49" class="t s1_49">to Buddha and he said, "Give me sannyas this very moment!" </div>
<div id="tr_49" class="t s1_49">Buddha said, "Wait. Don't be in such a hurry." </div>
<div id="ts_49" class="t s1_49">"But," he said, "I cannot wait. I don't know what waiting is. When I want to do </div>
<div id="tt_49" class="t s1_49">something, I want to do something. And enough is enough! I have lived the life </div>
<div id="tu_49" class="t s1_49">of a debauch, and I have been simply wasting myself. It has been suicidal. Now I </div>
<div id="tv_49" class="t s1_49">cannot go back home. You accept me." </div>
<div id="tw_49" class="t s1_49">Even Buddha's disciples said, "Why don't you accept him? You never say no to </div>
<div id="tx_49" class="t s1_49">anybody. Why are you hesitating?" Ananda said, "Why are you hesitating? He is </div>
<div id="ty_49" class="t s1_49">great prince, well known, and he is ready. He is ready to surrender totally." </div>
<div id="tz_49" class="t s1_49">Buddha said, "I am hesitating because I am afraid that this may be just another </div>
<div id="t10_49" class="t s1_49">extreme. This man has been just indulgent. Now he may renounce and just move </div>
<div id="t11_49" class="t s1_49">to another extreme -- and renunciation is in the middle." </div>
<div id="t12_49" class="t s1_49">But Srona persisted; he wouldn't go. He was sitting there from the morning till </div>
<div id="t13_49" class="t s1_49">the evening. He was a man of that type. The more Buddha said no, the more he </div>
<div id="t14_49" class="t s1_49">became insistent. Next morning, Buddha accepted him as a disciple. This sutra is </div>
<div id="t15_49" class="t s1_49">about Srona. </div>
<div id="t16_49" class="t s1_49">The story says that when Srona became a BHIKKHU, a monk, immediately he </div>
