<div id="t1_273" class="t s1_273">CHAPTER 23. THE ONLY WAY TO FAIL ME IS NOT TO BE YOURSELF</div>
<div id="t2_273" class="t s2_273">There is every possibility of a strange conspiracy. Only Gurdjieff used to talk about it; he was the ﬁrst</div>
<div id="t3_273" class="t s2_273">man to talk about it. Christians of course cannot talk about it. And Jews have never bothered about</div>
<div id="t4_273" class="t s2_273">the cruciﬁxion; they have not even mentioned anywhere that this carpenter’s son was cruciﬁed.</div>
<div id="t5_273" class="t s2_273">They simply ignored it – just a mad guy – in their history books, their religious book. Nnowhere is</div>
<div id="t6_273" class="t s2_273">cruciﬁxion mentioned, other than in Christian books. That is the New Testament, which was written</div>
<div id="t7_273" class="t s2_273">three hundred years after Jesus’ cruciﬁxion, so-called cruciﬁxion.</div>
<div id="t8_273" class="t s2_273">Gurdjieff had a few very signiﬁcant ideas.</div>
<div id="t9_273" class="t s2_273">I can only call them ideas because they cannot be</div>
<div id="ta_273" class="t s2_273">authenticated by any other source; but Gurdjieff was a man of penetrating mind.</div>
<div id="tb_273" class="t s2_273">One idea was</div>
<div id="tc_273" class="t s2_273">that the story of Jesus is not historical.</div>
<div id="td_273" class="t s2_273">It was a drama that was played year after year in olden</div>
<div id="te_273" class="t s2_273">times, just as Rama’s story in India has been played year after year for ﬁve thousand years. Even</div>
<div id="tf_273" class="t s2_273">today, every year in every village, every town, every city, even the smallest village has its own group</div>
<div id="tg_273" class="t s2_273">of actors playing the story of Rama, Ramleela. The same time each year the story is played. There</div>
<div id="th_273" class="t s2_273">is a possibility that there has never been such a man as Rama; it has been only a story, but it has</div>
<div id="ti_273" class="t s2_273">been played for ﬁve thousand years continually so that it has taken a historicalness about itself.</div>
<div id="tj_273" class="t s2_273">Gurdjieff said Jesus’ cruciﬁxion and the whole story of Jesus was a drama played every year; no</div>
<div id="tk_273" class="t s2_273">historical event happened. I don’t agree with this, because if it was so the Jews would have continued</div>
<div id="tl_273" class="t s2_273">to play the story, just as Hindus have continued to play the story. Why were they stopped? What</div>
<div id="tm_273" class="t s2_273">happened? The story is beautiful; why did Jews simply stop it? And no Jewish source mentions it,</div>
<div id="tn_273" class="t s2_273">even as a story. And if it was being played for thousands of years, it is impossible that there was</div>
<div id="to_273" class="t s2_273">no other source where it was related. And why did it suddenly stop two thousand years ago? No, it</div>
<div id="tp_273" class="t s2_273">cannot be just a drama. And a drama cannot create so much trouble in the world. A drama cannot</div>
<div id="tq_273" class="t s2_273">create Christianity. A drama cannot create all that the Christians have done to humanity. No, no</div>
<div id="tr_273" class="t s2_273">drama is so powerful.</div>
<div id="ts_273" class="t s2_273">His second idea is also very signiﬁcant, and there are moments when I think perhaps he is right</div>
<div id="tt_273" class="t s2_273">about the second idea. With the ﬁrst idea, I simply disagree with him. But the second idea is that</div>
<div id="tu_273" class="t s2_273">Judas did not betray Jesus – he was Jesus’ closest disciple. It was Jesus who persuaded Judas</div>
<div id="tv_273" class="t s2_273">to deliver him to the enemies. That too has no source anywhere. Gurdjieff was a strange man, but</div>
<div id="tw_273" class="t s2_273">once in a while he used to stumble upon certain fragments of truth, certain aspects.</div>
<div id="tx_273" class="t s2_273">I can see some possibility of truth in this, because there was no need for Judas to betray. They had</div>
<div id="ty_273" class="t s2_273">never been in a ﬁght. There was no question about his being the successor, because he was the</div>
<div id="tz_273" class="t s2_273">most literate, the most cultured, the most educated person amongst Jesus’ apostles. All the others</div>
<div id="t10_273" class="t s2_273">were just very ordinary people from the masses. He was the only one – he was far better educated,</div>
<div id="t11_273" class="t s2_273">far more cultured than Jesus himself. It was absolutely certain that he was going to take over once</div>
<div id="t12_273" class="t s2_273">Jesus was gone. There was nobody to compete with him. There was no conﬂict. There had been</div>
<div id="t13_273" class="t s2_273">no ﬁght, and it was not possible that he would sell his master for thirty silver pieces. And if he was</div>
<div id="t14_273" class="t s2_273">really so much against Jesus, then why did he commit suicide after Jesus’ cruciﬁxion?</div>
<div id="t15_273" class="t s2_273">Christians don’t talk about Judas’ suicide, which is very signiﬁcant.</div>
<div id="t16_273" class="t s2_273">Perhaps Gurdjieff is right.</div>
<div id="t17_273" class="t s2_273">Perhaps Jesus persuaded Judas, ordered Judas, ”Go and deliver me to them, and deliver me in</div>
<div id="t18_273" class="t s2_273">such a way that they don’t suspect that you are being sent by me – so if they offer some bribe, you</div>
<div id="t19_273" class="t s2_273">accept.” They offered thirty silver pieces. He accepted gratefully and he brought them to the place</div>
<div id="t1a_273" class="t s2_273">where Jesus was staying. Jesus was caught and the next day he was cruciﬁed. It seems Gurdjieff</div>
<div id="t1b_273" class="t s2_273">has a point there, because Jesus knew beforehand that he was going to be cruciﬁed the next day.</div>
<div id="t1c_273" class="t s2_273">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t1d_273" class="t s2_273">273</div>
<div id="t1e_273" class="t s3_273">Osho</div>
