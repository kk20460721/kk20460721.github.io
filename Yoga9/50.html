<div id="t5_50" class="t s1_50">authentic. You are not sincere towards yourself; you have been betraying your being. </div>
<div id="t6_50" class="t s1_50">So if you ask -- there are priests and philosophers and demagogues -- if you go and ask </div>

<div id="te_50" class="t s1_50">I have heard: </div>
<div id="tf_50" class="t s1_50">The new vicar had been overworking and examination revealed that his lungs were </div>

<div id="th_50" class="t s1_50">protested and said he could not possibly afford to leave his work. </div>

<div id="tj_50" class="t s1_50">The vicar walked the room for some time and then said, "You win, Switzerland it is." </div>

<div id="ts_50" class="t s1_50">And you go and ask them. They are themselves trembling. Deep down they are </div>
<div id="tt_50" class="t s1_50">themselves afraid. They and their disciples are all in the same boat. </div>
<div id="tu_50" class="t s1_50">I have heard: </div>
<div id="tv_50" class="t s1_50">The Pope lay gravely ill in the Vatican, and a message was issued that a special </div>

<div id="tz_50" class="t s1_50">appealing to all you good Catholics gathered here today for a donor." </div>
<div id="t10_50" class="t s1_50">He held up a feather and continued, "I shall drop this feather among you, and on </div>

<div id="t15_50" class="t s1_50">Everybody is afraid. If the Holy Father wants to survive, why should these poor Catholics </div>
