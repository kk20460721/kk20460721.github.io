<div id="t1_422" class="t s1_422">The young man was shocked. This is ridiculous behavior; has his father gone insane? He</div>
<div id="t2_422" class="t s1_422">was hoping to become the king and he has become a beggar. But what can you do? Soon he</div>
<div id="t3_422" class="t s1_422">was feeling hungry, thirsty and although it was very shameful, he had to beg. He started</div>
<div id="t4_422" class="t s1_422">begging on the street like an ordinary beggar.</div>
<div id="t5_422" class="t s1_422">Years passed; he completely forgot that he used to be a prince, he settled. Man has</div>
<div id="t6_422" class="t s1_422">immense capacity to adapt to any condition, and when something is absolutely inescapable</div>
<div id="t7_422" class="t s1_422">you cannot do anything else. A certain afternoon, in the hot sun, he was standing before a</div>
<div id="t8_422" class="t s1_422">hotel asking people, "I have been hungry for two days, give me something." A few coins had</div>
<div id="t9_422" class="t s1_422">been dropped into his begging bowl ... and then suddenly he heard the noise of a golden</div>
<div id="ta_422" class="t s1_422">chariot. In a second, instantly, he remembered his own chariot. Strange ... it looked exactly</div>
<div id="tb_422" class="t s1_422">like that.</div>
<div id="tc_422" class="t s1_422">The chariot stopped and the same charioteer -- although he had become very old -- got</div>
<div id="td_422" class="t s1_422">down, touched the feet of the prince, gave his robes and his crown back to him, and said,</div>
<div id="te_422" class="t s1_422">"Drop it! Throw away all those beggar's clothes. First come to a good hotel; take a good bath,</div>
<div id="tf_422" class="t s1_422">clean yourself, dress well. Your father is dying and he has remembered you; he wants you to</div>
<div id="tg_422" class="t s1_422">come immediately, because he wants to give you the kingdom and the key to his treasures</div>
<div id="th_422" class="t s1_422">with his own hand."</div>
<div id="ti_422" class="t s1_422">The people from whom he was begging gathered around. They could not believe their</div>
<div id="tj_422" class="t s1_422">eyes, not because of the clothes, the crown, the golden chariot, but because the face of the</div>
<div id="tk_422" class="t s1_422">young man immediately changed. His eyes had a different look, his pride returned; now he</div>
<div id="tl_422" class="t s1_422">was standing there with great dignity and grandeur. The beggar disappeared in a split second.</div>
<div id="tm_422" class="t s1_422">Just a moment before he was a totally different man; just a moment later a discontinuity</div>
<div id="tn_422" class="t s1_422">had happened. The abruptness, the suddenness ... even he could not believe it, because he</div>
<div id="to_422" class="t s1_422">could see the change even in his consciousness. The way he walked, the way he sat in the</div>
<div id="tp_422" class="t s1_422">chariot, everything had changed; the way he looked at people -- it was not with the same eyes.</div>
<div id="tq_422" class="t s1_422">Just the remembrance, nothing else had happened; just the awakening of the fact that he is a</div>
<div id="tr_422" class="t s1_422">prince and is going to be a successor to a great kingdom, just words ... but all is changed.</div>
<div id="ts_422" class="t s1_422">The same kind of miracle happens through meditation: you suddenly recognize that a great</div>
<div id="tt_422" class="t s1_422">kingdom belongs to you, the kingdom of the whole existence; that you are not a beggar who</div>
<div id="tu_422" class="t s1_422">was ambitious for trivia, who was desiring this and that, who was hoping to have more power,</div>
<div id="tv_422" class="t s1_422">more prestige. All the symptoms of being a beggar ... as one enters into meditation, all these</div>
<div id="tw_422" class="t s1_422">symptoms disappear. One suddenly finds one has the kingdom, one's home; one lacks nothing,</div>
<div id="tx_422" class="t s1_422">one is entire, complete, fulfilled.</div>
<div id="ty_422" class="t s1_422">It is for this reason that Ta Hui says, IF YOU WERE A MAN, a real meditative man,</div>
<div id="tz_422" class="t s1_422">WHEN YOU HEARD ME SAY, "WHERE ARE THERE OLD ADEPTS APPEARING IN</div>
<div id="t10_422" class="t s1_422">THE WORLD?" YOU SHOULD HAVE SPIT RIGHT IN MY FACE.</div>
<div id="t11_422" class="t s1_422">These are special ways of Zen; they are not understandable outside the world of Zen. Now</div>
<div id="t12_422" class="t s1_422">Ta Hui is a master and he is saying, "When I was talking nonsense, if you were a real man you</div>
<div id="t13_422" class="t s1_422">would have spit right in my face. You could have stopped me."</div>
<div id="t14_422" class="t s1_422">It happened that one bishop in Japan wanted very much to see a Zen master, Lin Chi. He</div>
<div id="t15_422" class="t s1_422">had heard much about him, and he was certain that if he went to him with THE BIBLE and</div>
<div id="t16_422" class="t s1_422">read a few beautiful statements of Jesus, particularly the Sermon on the Mount, he was sure</div>
<div id="t17_422" class="t s1_422">that he could convert Lin Chi into being a Christian. And to convert Lin Chi meant converting</div>
<div id="t18_422" class="t s1_422">thousands of his followers; even the emperor of Japan was one of his disciples. Going into the</div>
<div id="t19_422" class="t s1_422">mountains and doing the tedious journey was worth it.</div>
<div id="t1a_422" class="t s1_422">Chapter 38 - Transformation</div>
<div id="t1b_422" class="t s1_422">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1c_422" class="t s1_422">422</div>
