<div id="t1_55" class="t s1_55">Then the master said, "The first lesson is over. Now begins the second lesson: now be </div>
<div id="t2_55" class="t s1_55">alert in your sleep. Leave your doors open, because I may come any time." </div>
<div id="t3_55" class="t s1_55">Now this was a harder thing! Initially he would come and hit him hard. The old man </div>
<div id="t4_55" class="t s1_55">did not need much sleep either; two hours was enough for him. And this was a young </div>
<div id="t5_55" class="t s1_55">man, he needed eight hours sleep, and the whole night it was a struggle. Many times he </div>
<div id="t6_55" class="t s1_55">would come and hit him, but the young man was now certain that if the first lesson had </div>
<div id="t7_55" class="t s1_55">been of such value... he became so alert and so peaceful that he was no longer inquiring, </div>
<div id="t8_55" class="t s1_55">"What are you doing? This is nonsense!" </div>
<div id="t9_55" class="t s1_55">The master himself said, "Don't be worried. Just keep alert even in your sleep. And the </div>
<div id="ta_55" class="t s1_55">harder I hit you, the better, because then you will be really alert. The situation has to be </div>
<div id="tb_55" class="t s1_55">created." </div>
<div id="tc_55" class="t s1_55">Within three months he would jump from his sleep. He would immediately open his </div>
<div id="td_55" class="t s1_55">eyes and say, "Wait! There is no need -- I am alert." </div>
<div id="te_55" class="t s1_55">After three months the master said, "You have passed the second lesson. Now the third </div>
<div id="tf_55" class="t s1_55">and the last." </div>
<div id="tg_55" class="t s1_55">The young man said, "What can be the third, because there are only two states -- </div>
<div id="th_55" class="t s1_55">waking, sleep. Now what are you going to do?" </div>
<div id="ti_55" class="t s1_55">He said, "Now I will hit with a real sword -- that is the third lesson." </div>
<div id="tj_55" class="t s1_55">It is one thing to be hit by a wooden sword -- you know that at the most you may be </div>
<div id="tk_55" class="t s1_55">hurt but you cannot be killed. And he brought out a real sword. He took it out of the </div>
<div id="tl_55" class="t s1_55">sheath, and the young man thought, "This is the end -- I am finished! This is a </div>
<div id="tm_55" class="t s1_55">dangerous game. Now he can hit with a real sword. Even if I miss once I have missed </div>
<div id="tn_55" class="t s1_55">forever!" </div>
<div id="to_55" class="t s1_55">But he did not miss even once. When the danger is such, you rise to face that danger. </div>
<div id="tp_55" class="t s1_55">After three months, not even a single time had the master been able to hit him with the </div>
<div id="tq_55" class="t s1_55">real sword. The master said, "Your third lesson is complete -- you have become a </div>
<div id="tr_55" class="t s1_55">meditator. Now tomorrow morning you can leave. You can go and tell your father that I </div>
<div id="ts_55" class="t s1_55">am absolutely contented with you." </div>
<div id="tt_55" class="t s1_55">The next morning he would leave. It is evening; the sun is setting. The master is reading </div>
<div id="tu_55" class="t s1_55">a sutra under a tree in the last rays of the sunlight. And the young man thinks -- he is </div>
<div id="tv_55" class="t s1_55">sitting somewhere back -- "Before I leave" -- the idea had come to him many times -- </div>
<div id="tw_55" class="t s1_55">"one time I have to hit this old man! Now this is the last day; tomorrow morning I will </div>
<div id="tx_55" class="t s1_55">leave." </div>
<div id="ty_55" class="t s1_55">So he prepares. He takes a wooden sword, hides behind a tree. The master says, "Stop!" </div>
<div id="tz_55" class="t s1_55">He does not look at him at all. "Come here! I am an old man, and such desires are not </div>
<div id="t10_55" class="t s1_55">good -- the desire to hit your own master!" </div>
<div id="t11_55" class="t s1_55">The young man is puzzled. He says, "But I have not said anything." </div>
<div id="t12_55" class="t s1_55">The master says, "One day when you become really alert, even that which is not said is </div>
<div id="t13_55" class="t s1_55">heard. Just as one day you were not hearing my footsteps and one day you became </div>
<div id="t14_55" class="t s1_55">aware and started hearing them; just like one day you were not able to hear my </div>
<div id="t15_55" class="t s1_55">footsteps in your sleep... but the day came when you started hearing my footsteps, even </div>
<div id="t16_55" class="t s1_55">in your sleep -- exactly like that, one day you will know. When the mind is absolutely </div>
<div id="t17_55" class="t s1_55">silent you can hear words that have not been spoken. You can read unexpressed </div>
