<div id="t1_39" class="t s1_39">Why "be quick" -- do it immediately? Mind will say, "Tomorrow. Wait. Let us think </div>
<div id="t2_39" class="t s1_39">about it." And thinking never comes to any conclusion, remember; thinking has never </div>
<div id="t3_39" class="t s1_39">come to any conclusion. Ten thousand years of philosophizing and there is not a single </div>
<div id="t4_39" class="t s1_39">conclusion in philosophy. They have not arrived at any truth; they are still continuing. </div>
<div id="t5_39" class="t s1_39">The same arguments go on being repeated in different forms and different ways, and </div>
<div id="t6_39" class="t s1_39">philosophy goes on moving in a vicious circle. The philosopher remains inconclusive, </div>
<div id="t7_39" class="t s1_39">and to remain inconclusive your whole life means not to live at all. </div>
<div id="t8_39" class="t s1_39">Life is possible only out of decisiveness, out of commitment, involvement; otherwise </div>
<div id="t9_39" class="t s1_39">you are always a spectator, you never participate in anything. How can you participate </div>
<div id="ta_39" class="t s1_39">unless logically you prove to yourself, to your heart's content, that this is so? </div>
<div id="tb_39" class="t s1_39">It is said about Immanuel Kant, a great philosopher, that a woman had asked him that </div>
<div id="tc_39" class="t s1_39">she would be immensely happy if he would accept her as his wife. She had to gather </div>
<div id="td_39" class="t s1_39">much courage to ask this, because Immanuel Kant was not a romantic person at all, </div>
<div id="te_39" class="t s1_39">very unromantic, absolutely unromantic. His life was not a life of spontaneity; he is an </div>
<div id="tf_39" class="t s1_39">example of a mechanical life. His whole life he followed a certain routine religiously. </div>
<div id="tg_39" class="t s1_39">At ten o'clock in the night he would go to bed; that means exactly ten, not one minute </div>
<div id="th_39" class="t s1_39">before, not one minute after. His servant... he had only one servant. Who else would </div>
<div id="ti_39" class="t s1_39">agree to live with such a person? -- only a servant. His family deserted him; he was so </div>
<div id="tj_39" class="t s1_39">mechanical, such a drain, such a drag on the whole family. The servant used to simply </div>
<div id="tk_39" class="t s1_39">tell him the time -- not "Now go to sleep"; he would simply come and declare, "It is ten </div>
<div id="tl_39" class="t s1_39">o'clock," and that was it. He would jump immediately into his bed. Even if there were </div>
<div id="tm_39" class="t s1_39">visitors, he would not even say goodbye to them. He would go into the bed, under his </div>
<div id="tn_39" class="t s1_39">blanket, and the servant would declare to the visitors, "Now you go please. He has gone </div>
<div id="to_39" class="t s1_39">to sleep." </div>
<div id="tp_39" class="t s1_39">At exactly five o'clock he had to be dragged out of the bed. Sometimes it was too cold </div>
<div id="tq_39" class="t s1_39">and he was too tired, but the routine had to be followed -- even if he was ill, the routine </div>
<div id="tr_39" class="t s1_39">had to be followed. The servant was told that maybe sometimes he will feel weak, </div>
<div id="ts_39" class="t s1_39">tempted to sleep a little longer, but he is not to listen. He has to be dragged out, even </div>
<div id="tt_39" class="t s1_39">against his will. Even if he is saying, "No, I want to sleep," the servant has to pull him </div>
<div id="tu_39" class="t s1_39">out. It sometimes used to be a fight, a quarrel. The servant had to beat him to bring him </div>
<div id="tv_39" class="t s1_39">out of the bed -- that was his duty. </div>
<div id="tw_39" class="t s1_39">The woman must have been rare! -- but you can always find crazy people everywhere. </div>
<div id="tx_39" class="t s1_39">She must have been crazy to fall in love with this man. This man was not a man but a </div>
<div id="ty_39" class="t s1_39">machine. And do you know what Immanuel Kant did? He listened to her and he said, "I </div>
<div id="tz_39" class="t s1_39">will think it over." And he thought for three years! -- all the pros and all the cons. He </div>
<div id="t10_39" class="t s1_39">wrote a long long treatise, what are the advantages of being married and what are the </div>
<div id="t11_39" class="t s1_39">disadvantages. And finally he arrived at a very poor conclusion, almost not a </div>
<div id="t12_39" class="t s1_39">conclusion at all. There was one point more in favor, and that was the point that by </div>
<div id="t13_39" class="t s1_39">being married you will know what marriage is -- good or bad -- that you will know. </div>
<div id="t14_39" class="t s1_39">That much is more in favor. </div>
<div id="t15_39" class="t s1_39">So he went, knocked on the woman's door. The father opened the door and asked, </div>
<div id="t16_39" class="t s1_39">"Why have you come?" </div>
