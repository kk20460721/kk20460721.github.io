<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">CHAPTER 1. ALL IS A MIRACLE</div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s2_4">the truths declared by Mahavira, Krishna or Buddha are revelations. They are not truths found by</div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s2_4">lamplight; they have been seen and known and revealed in the dazzling lightning ﬂash of a still mind</div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s2_4">– a mind devoid of thoughts. The truth which Mahavira knew was not discovered by him step by</div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s2_4">step; otherwise he could not have known the total truth. He knew it in its totality in a single moment.</div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s2_4">What I want to tell you is that everything revealed in its totality through the wisdom of the East is</div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s2_4">included in this short sutra. It is there in its totality. This is why we in India declare that the conclusion</div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s2_4">is ﬁrst and the inquiry follows. The announcement of the truth is made in the beginning, then we</div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s2_4">discuss how the truth can be known, how it has been known, and how that can be explained. This</div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s2_4">sutra is an announcement – a proclamation. The rest of the book is not essential for those who</div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s2_4">can comprehend the full meaning from the announcement. Nothing new will be stated in the entire</div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s2_4">Upanishad: the truth will be retold again and again in various ways. The remainder of the book is for</div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s2_4">those who are blind to the dazzling ﬂash of lightning, and stubbornly insist on searching for truth with</div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s2_4">the help of a lamp. By the light of this lamp, the truth can be picked out line by line in the Ishavasya</div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s2_4">sutra; but ﬁrst the subject is presented in its entirety in this great sutra. That is why I told you this</div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s2_4">sutra is so unique: it says everything. Now let us try to understand it.</div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s2_4">It declares that the whole is born out of the whole, and yet that which remains behind is always</div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s2_4">whole; in the end the whole is absorbed into the whole, and even then the whole increases not at</div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s2_4">all, it remains as it was before. This is a very great antimathematical statement. P. D. Ouspensky</div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s2_4">has written a book called Tertium Organum. He was a renowned mathematician of Russia, who in</div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s2_4">later years, as a disciple of a remarkable western master, Gurdjieff, became a mystic himself. He</div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s2_4">was a mathematical genius, his intelligence penetrating the heights and depths of his subject.</div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s2_4">The ﬁrst statement he makes in this wonderful book is that there are only three great canons of</div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s2_4">thought in the world. The ﬁrst, entitled Organum, is by Aristotle, father of the Western science of</div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s2_4">logic. Organum means the principle of knowledge. The second book is by Francis Bacon and is</div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s2_4">called Novum Organum – the new principle of knowledge. And the third one is his own book, which</div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s2_4">is called Tertium Organum – the third principle of knowledge. He follows this statement with a short</div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s2_4">sentence that has puzzled many people: ”Before the ﬁrst existed, the third was.” That is, the third</div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s2_4">principle was already in the world before the ﬁrst principle was discovered. The ﬁrst book was written</div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s2_4">by Aristotle two thousand years ago, the second by Bacon three hundred years ago, and the third</div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s2_4">one was written some forty years ago. But Ouspensky says the third existed in the world before the</div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s2_4">ﬁrst was written, even though he wrote this third book only forty years ago. When anyone asked him</div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s2_4">the meaning of this crazy, illogical statement, he replied, ”Whatever I have written is not written by</div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s2_4">me. It was already in existence; I have simply proclaimed it.”</div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s2_4">The earth was under the inﬂuence of gravity before Newton was born. The earth attracted a stone</div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s2_4">before his birth in the same way that it has done ever since. Newton did not invent the principle of</div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s2_4">gravitation, he only revealed it. He opened what was hidden, he made known what was unknown.</div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s2_4">But gravity was already there before Newton; otherwise Newton himself would not have been there.</div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s2_4">Newton could not have been born without gravity. Gravity can exist without him, but he cannot exist</div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s2_4">without the earth’s gravity. It existed already but was not known in the world.</div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s2_4">Ouspensky says his third principle existed before the ﬁrst was known. It is quite a different matter</div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s2_4">that it was not known; and perhaps it is wrong to say it was not known, because what Ouspensky</div>
<div id="t17_4" class="t s2_4">has said throughout his book is contained in this small sutra. His Tertium Organum is a very valuable</div>
<div id="t18_4" class="t s2_4">The Heartbeat of the Absolute</div>
<div id="t19_4" class="t s2_4">4</div>
<div id="t1a_4" class="t s3_4">Osho</div>
