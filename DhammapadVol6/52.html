<div id="t1_52" class="t s1_52">to the cessation of sorrow, you will attain to nirvana. Buddha says: These are the four </div>
<div id="t2_52" class="t s1_52">noble truths. </div>
<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">THEN AT LAST HE IS SAFE. </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">And one who has moved through all these four and attained to the fourth, he is at last </div>
<div id="t5_52" class="t s1_52">safe. </div>
<div id="t6_52" class="t s1_52">HE HAS SHAKEN OFF SORROW. </div>
<div id="t7_52" class="t s1_52">HE IS FREE. </div>
<div id="t8_52" class="t s1_52">To be free of sorrow is to be free. If you remain in sorrow you are not free. If you remain </div>
<div id="t9_52" class="t s1_52">sad, howsoever great a saint you may be, you are not free; you are still far away from </div>
<div id="ta_52" class="t s1_52">the goal. </div>
<div id="tb_52" class="t s1_52">And our so-called saints are very sad-looking people. People think the sadder they are, </div>
<div id="tc_52" class="t s1_52">the greater they are. They are not free from sorrow, in fact they are more in sorrow than </div>
<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">the ordinary, worldly people. The worldly people sometimes laugh too, enjoy too, </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">dance too, sing too, but the so-called saint looks at these laughing, singing, dancing </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">people with condemnation. He thinks them just superficial. Their laughter is not </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">laughter to him, their joy is not joy to him. He has a great condemnation of all this, </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">because he has renounced all these things without understanding, without going </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">through these four noble truths. He has simply renounced; he has followed a tradition, </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">a convention, of renunciation. He is an escapist. He has to condemn all laughter, </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">because he cannot laugh. He has become dry, dry like a rock; he cannot bloom into </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">flowers. He has to condemn all springs and he has to condemn all rosebushes. And he </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">finds ways and means to condemn you. </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">If you go to a so-called saint, he looks at you as if you are not a human being. He looks </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">at you as doomed, as doomed to hell, bound towards hell, already falling into the </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">bottomless pit of hell. He looks at you with condemnation, with pity. But pity is not </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">compassion, and condemnation simply shows that he has not known anything at all. </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">He is just the same type of person as you are, only standing on his head. You are greedy </div>
<div id="ts_52" class="t s1_52">for money, he is afraid of money. You are related to money through greed, he is related </div>
<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">to it through fear. But both are related to money, both are obsessed with money. </div>
<div id="tu_52" class="t s1_52">It is said that if you take money to Vinoba Bhave he immediately closes his eyes -- he </div>
<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">can't see money. Now this looks ridiculous -- there must be great fear. Just a ten-rupee </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">note... why should you be so afraid of it that you have to close your eyes? But because </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">he closes his eyes -- he never touches money, he does not want to see money -- he is </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">revered as a great saint. But this fear of money, this antagonism, is a kind of </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">relationship. He is not free of money, otherwise why close his eyes? And a ten-rupee </div>
<div id="t10_52" class="t s1_52">note is nothing but a piece of paper. You don't close your eyes when you look at other </div>
<div id="t11_52" class="t s1_52">pieces of paper -- why give so much importance to this piece of paper? There must be </div>
<div id="t12_52" class="t s1_52">greed deep down which is standing on its head. </div>
