<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">When hope disappears, desire is seen in its nudity. Hope keeps on hiding desire in </div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">beautiful garments. </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">BUT NOW I SEE YOU, O BUILDER! AND NEVER AGAIN SHALL YOU BUILD MY </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">HOUSE. Buddha says... this is his first statement after his enlightenment. The moment </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">he became enlightened, the morning he became enlightened, with the last star </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">disappearing, this was his first utterance, tremendously pregnant. He looked at the sky; </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">the sun had not yet risen and the last star had just disappeared. He was as empty as the </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">outer sky. And this was his first declaration to existence -- not to anyone in particular. </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">He simply said, uttered -- as if talking to himself or thinking aloud: BUT NOW I SEE </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">YOU, O BUILDER! AND NEVER AGAIN SHALL YOU BUILD MY HOUSE. </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">He says, "I have seen the secret of desire. It is desire that has been creating new bodies, </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">new minds for me, new bodymind mechanisms for me -- and I have seen it. Now it will </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">not be possible for it to create any more trouble for me." </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">The moment you see the cause of your trouble, the trouble disappears -- and the cause </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">too. Seeing is transformation. To know is to be liberated. </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">I HAVE SNAPPED THE RAFTERS, </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">SPLIT THE RIDGEPOLE </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">AND BEATEN OUT DESIRE. </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">AND NOW MY MIND IS FREE. </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">What are the rafters and what does he mean by the ridgepole? These are his metaphors. </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">By rafters he means the past and the memories. The past tries to persist, the past goes </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">on perpetuating itself. Yesterday you were angry, the day before yesterday you were </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">angry, and so on and so forth. Now that anger is waiting in you just for an excuse to </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">explode. The past perpetuates itself. And if you cannot find an excuse you will be angry </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">without any excuse. You will create an excuse, you will invent one -- you will have to, </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">because the anger that you have been going through every day is waiting for its time. It </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">is like tea-time, and your body starts asking for tea. A little tannin is needed... or a little </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">nicotine. </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">This is happening to Krishna Prem! Just a few weeks ago Laxmi was after him: "Stop </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">smoking!" He was smoking too much. And finally he stopped; with great will he forced </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">himself and stopped. Since that time he has not been in good shape. He became ill, for </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">weeks he remained ill, weak. Now he has come out of his illness. He had to take many </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">medicines and treatments. Now he gets angry at any slight excuse, or no excuse. </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">Just the other day he asked me, "Beloved Master, what should I do?" </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">I said, "Smoke! And don't listen to Laxmi again!" </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">An old habit... now the body needs a certain quantity of nicotine; if it is not there then </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">uneasiness is created. And there is nothing unspiritual in nicotine, remember; nicotine </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">is as spiritual as anything else. </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">If you have been doing something for a long time you become habituated, and once you </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">become habituated to a certain thing, it forces you to do it again and again. Buddha calls </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">it "the rafters of desire": the past tries to perpetuate itself. </div>
