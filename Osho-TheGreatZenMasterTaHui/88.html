<div id="t1_88" class="t s1_88">The master said, "As long as you go on finding, you will not have found it. Just go back. I</div>
<div id="t2_88" class="t s1_88">know you have brought some stupid sound again!"</div>
<div id="t3_88" class="t s1_88">This was the student ... After one year, when he came in, the master saw that slapping was</div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s1_88">not going to do it -- he had been slapping him for one year continually! He just took hold of</div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s1_88">him and threw him out of the window. It was a two-story building ...</div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s1_88">It was such a shock to the student. He was expecting a slap, but he was not expecting to be</div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s1_88">thrown from the window into a ditch. And besides that, the master jumped on top of him, so</div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s1_88">the few bones which had been left unbroken were now broken. He had multiple fractures! And</div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s1_88">on top of all that, the master was asking, "Got it?" The shock was such that his mind stopped</div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">-- it was so unexpected.</div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">Mind stops only when there is something unexpected -- so unexpected that the mind</div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s1_88">cannot figure it out ... it stops.</div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s1_88">Absolute silence ... and tears of joy in the eyes of the disciple. He touched the feet of the</div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s1_88">master and said, "Why have you waited for one year? You could have done it on the very first</div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s1_88">day."</div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s1_88">The master said, "It would not have worked. I had to wait for the right moment, when you</div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s1_88">were ripe. You had worked hard with your mind. Your mind was tired, utterly tired; it had lost</div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s1_88">all hope that there is any possibility to find the answer. This was the moment when, if</div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s1_88">something unexpected happens to you, the mind may stop -- just for a single moment. And</div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s1_88">that's enough to hear the sound of one hand clapping."</div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s1_88">The words are deceiving. It is not the sound of one hand clapping; it is the silence when</div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s1_88">the mind stops. Now anybody looking at the anecdote and not knowing the whole inner</div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s1_88">process -- just an outsider -- is bound to think this is simply stupid. But the disciple became</div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s1_88">enlightened, and it is always the end which decides whether the means were right or wrong.</div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s1_88">Ta Hui is just an intellectual, so sometimes he repeats beautiful words. But here he has</div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s1_88">shown his reality, because he could not conceive any meaning in the stories and the anecdotes.</div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s1_88">I will go into them.</div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s1_88">You must see the moon and forget the finger. This is so easy to repeat, because for the</div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s1_88">thousands of years since Gautam Buddha this has been one of the most important statements:</div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s1_88">the buddha only points the finger towards the moon.</div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s1_88">His 'finger' means all that he says, all that he does, and it is only an indication -- a hint.</div>
<div id="tw_88" class="t s1_88">You should not get too much attached to the finger, because the finger is not the point. What</div>
<div id="tx_88" class="t s1_88">he is saying, what he is preaching, is not the point; it is only an indication. You should not get</div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s1_88">attached to the philosophy, you should not become a buddhist. You should look at the moon.</div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">And if you want to look at the moon, the most fundamental thing is to forget all about the</div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s1_88">finger. If your eyes are focused on the finger, how are you going to see the moon? Unless you</div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s1_88">move your eyes from the finger towards the faraway moon in the sky, it is not possible.</div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s1_88">Buddha was saying, "Don't get attached to what I say, don't get attached to any doctrine, to</div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s1_88">what I preach; don't get attached to my personality. These are all just fingers pointing to the</div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s1_88">moon. Forget me, don't start worshiping me; just look at the moon. And once you have looked</div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s1_88">at the moon, I don't matter at all."</div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s1_88">It is a very pregnant statement, and a very courageous one, to make to one's own disciples:</div>
<div id="t17_88" class="t s1_88">"Don't bother about what I say. I am not preaching any doctrine and I am not delivering to you</div>
<div id="t18_88" class="t s1_88">Chapter 7 - The source</div>
