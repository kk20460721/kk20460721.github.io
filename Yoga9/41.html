<div id="t8_41" class="t s1_41">" But they have to be powerful. </div>
<div id="t9_41" class="t s1_41">Otherwise you will not be able to even feel what power is. These senses have to be so full </div>
<div id="ta_41" class="t s1_41">of power, so high with power, that you can perform samyama, that you can meditate upon </div>
<div id="tb_41" class="t s1_41">them. </div>
<div id="tc_41" class="t s1_41">Right now when you look at a flower, the flower is there, but have you ever felt your </div>
<div id="td_41" class="t s1_41">eyes? You see the flower, but have you felt the power of your eyes? It should be there </div>
<div id="te_41" class="t s1_41">because you are using your eyes to see the flower. And of course eyes are more beautiful </div>
<div id="tf_41" class="t s1_41">than any flower because all flowers have to come through the eyes. It is through the eyes </div>
<div id="tg_41" class="t s1_41">that you have become aware of the world of flowers, but have you ever felt the power of </div>
<div id="th_41" class="t s1_41">the eyes? They are almost dull, dead. They have become passive, just like windows, </div>
<div id="ti_41" class="t s1_41">receptive. They don't go to their object. And power means being active. Power means </div>
<div id="tj_41" class="t s1_41">your eyes going and almost touching the flowers, your ears going and almost touching </div>
<div id="tk_41" class="t s1_41">the songs of the birds, your hands going with the total energy in you, focused there and </div>
<div id="tl_41" class="t s1_41">touching your beloved. Or you are lying down on the grass, your whole body, full of </div>
<div id="tm_41" class="t s1_41">power, meeting in a contact with the grass, having a dialogue with the grass. Or you are </div>
<div id="tn_41" class="t s1_41">swimming in the river and whispering with the river and listening to the whispers of the </div>
<div id="to_41" class="t s1_41">river. Connected, in communion, but power is needed. </div>
<div id="tp_41" class="t s1_41">So the first thing I would like you to do is when you see, really see, become the eyes. </div>
<div id="tq_41" class="t s1_41">Forget everything. Let your whole energy flow through the eyes. And your eyes will be </div>
<div id="tr_41" class="t s1_41">cleaned, bathed in an inner shower, and you will be able to see that these trees are no </div>
<div id="ts_41" class="t s1_41">longer the same, the greenery is no longer the same. It has become greener, as if dust has </div>
<div id="tt_41" class="t s1_41">disappeared from it. The dust was not on the trees. It was on your eyes. And you will see </div>
<div id="tu_41" class="t s1_41">for the first time and you will hear for the first time. </div>

<div id="t14_41" class="t s1_41">I remember Meister Eckhart's famous saying. The day he realized and became </div>
<div id="t15_41" class="t s1_41">enlightened, his friends and disciples and brothers asked, "What have you seen?" He </div>
<div id="t16_41" class="t s1_41">laughed. He is the only one in the whole of Christianity who comes very close tO Zen </div>
<div id="t17_41" class="t s1_41">Masters, almost a Zen Master. He laughed; he said, "I have not seen him. He has seen </div>
<div id="t18_41" class="t s1_41">himself through me. God has seen himself through me. These eyes are his. And what a </div>
<div id="t19_41" class="t s1_41">game, what a play. He has seen himself through me." </div>
<div id="t1a_41" class="t s1_41">When you really feel the nature of your senses, you will feel it is divine. It is God who </div>
<div id="t1b_41" class="t s1_41">has moved through your hand. It is God's hand. All hands are his. It is God who has loved </div>
<div id="t1c_41" class="t s1_41">through you. All love affairs are his. And how can it be otherWise? Hindus call it leela </div>
<div id="t1d_41" class="t s1_41">God's play. It is he who is calling you through the cuckoo, and it is he who is listening </div>
<div id="t1e_41" class="t s1_41">through you. It is he and he alone spread all over. </div>
