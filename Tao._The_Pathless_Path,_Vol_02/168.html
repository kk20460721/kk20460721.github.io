<div id="t1_168" class="t s1_168">CHAPTER 9. THE MASTER IS A MUST</div>
<div id="t2_168" class="t s2_168">I have heard about a man who used to take care of a watch-tower. It is an old story, maybe a hundred</div>
<div id="t3_168" class="t s2_168">years old. In those days each watch-tower had a gun and the gun used to go off every ﬁve minutes</div>
<div id="t4_168" class="t s2_168">continually, twenty-four hours a day. That was the only way to give signals tc the ships passing by.</div>
<div id="t5_168" class="t s2_168">This man used to live there, he used to sleep there, and although the gun would go off each ﬁve</div>
<div id="t6_168" class="t s2_168">minutes he was never disturbed. For thirty years he lived there.</div>
<div id="t7_168" class="t s2_168">Then one day something went wrong and the gun didn’t go off. He was fast asleep, it was the middle</div>
<div id="t8_168" class="t s2_168">of the night. He jumped up and said, ’What happened? What went wrong?’ He felt very uneasy.</div>
<div id="t9_168" class="t s2_168">His mind had become accustomed to the gun going off each ﬁve minutes. It was no longer noise, it</div>
<div id="ta_168" class="t s2_168">was his atmosphere, it was his mind, it was part of his mind. Now suddenly the gun was not going</div>
<div id="tb_168" class="t s2_168">off and because of that his sleep was broken But the noise of the gun had never broken his sleep.</div>
<div id="tc_168" class="t s2_168">This is how it happens – when whatsoever you know about yourself suddenly goes off, you feel</div>
<div id="td_168" class="t s2_168">empty. It is not empty. It is full of silence. It is a new fullness, it is a totally new well-being. God is</div>
<div id="te_168" class="t s2_168">descending on you but you cannot feel God. You go on groping for your old furniture and it is not</div>
<div id="tf_168" class="t s2_168">there and you become very much afraid – ’What has happened to me? ’Have I gone mad?’</div>
<div id="tg_168" class="t s2_168">’I SEE YOUR HEART ’ SAID THE PHYSICIAN. ’THE PLACE AN INCH SQUARE IS EMPTY. YOU</div>
<div id="th_168" class="t s2_168">ARE ALMOST A SAGE. SIX OF THE HOLES OF YOUR HEART RUN INTO EACH OTHER BUT</div>
<div id="ti_168" class="t s2_168">ONE IS STOPPED UP. CAN THIS BE THE REASON WHY YOU NOW THINK THE WISDOM OF</div>
<div id="tj_168" class="t s2_168">THE SAGE IS AN ILLNESS? MY SHALLOW CRAFT CAN DO NOTHING TO CURE IT.’</div>
<div id="tk_168" class="t s2_168">This parable is very relevant to my whole life. I was also taken to a VAIDYA to a physician. In fact,</div>
<div id="tl_168" class="t s2_168">I was taken to many doctors and to many physicians but only one ayurvedic VAIDYA told my father,</div>
<div id="tm_168" class="t s2_168">’He is not ill. Don’t waste your time.’ Of course, they were dragging me from one place to another.</div>
<div id="tn_168" class="t s2_168">And many people would give me medicines and I would tell my father, ’Why are you worried? I am</div>
<div id="to_168" class="t s2_168">perfectly okay.’ But nobody would believe what I was saying. They would say, ’You keep quiet. You</div>
<div id="tp_168" class="t s2_168">just take the medicine. What is wrong in it?’ So I used to take all sorts of medicines.</div>
<div id="tq_168" class="t s2_168">There was only one VAIDYA who was a man of insight – his name was Pundit Bhaghirat Prasad. His</div>
<div id="tr_168" class="t s2_168">daughter lives here in Poona, is married to a physician. That old man has gone but he was a rare</div>
<div id="ts_168" class="t s2_168">man of insight. He looked at me and he said, ’He is not ill.’ And he started crying and said, ’I have</div>
<div id="tt_168" class="t s2_168">been searching for this state myself. He is fortunate. In this life I have missed this state. Don’t take</div>
<div id="tu_168" class="t s2_168">him to anybody. He is reaching home.’ And he cried tears of happiness.</div>
<div id="tv_168" class="t s2_168">He was a seeker. He had been searching all over the country from this end to that. His whole life</div>
<div id="tw_168" class="t s2_168">was a search and enquiry. He had some idea of what it was about. He became my protector – my</div>
<div id="tx_168" class="t s2_168">protector against the doctors and other physicians. He said to my father, ’You leave it to me. I will</div>
<div id="ty_168" class="t s2_168">take care.’ He never gave me any medicine. When my father insisted, he just gave me sugar pills</div>
<div id="tz_168" class="t s2_168">and told me, ’These are sugar pills. Just to console them you can take them. They will not harm,</div>
<div id="t10_168" class="t s2_168">they will not help. In fact, there is no help possible.’</div>
<div id="t11_168" class="t s2_168">This man, Wen Chih, must have been a man like that. He said: ’MY SHALLOW CRAFT CAN DO</div>
<div id="t12_168" class="t s2_168">NOTHING TO CURE IT.’</div>
<div id="t13_168" class="t s2_168">Tao: The Pathless Path, Vol 2</div>
