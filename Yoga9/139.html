<div id="t1_139" class="t s1_139">This is altogether a new problem -- particularly for Indians, who cannot think of it as a </div>
<div id="t2_139" class="t s1_139">problem. If it happens to them, they will go to the temple and thank God. Even when they </div>
<div id="t3_139" class="t s1_139">are young, if the sex desire disappears, they will be very, very happy, tremendously </div>
<div id="t4_139" class="t s1_139">happy. God has been very helpful; the problem is solved. But the problem may not be </div>
<div id="t5_139" class="t s1_139">solved; they may be simply getting impotent. </div>
<div id="t6_139" class="t s1_139">The problem arises because of a certain outlook. The problem is not a problem in itself; it </div>
<div id="t7_139" class="t s1_139">depends on your outlook. If you are a Westerner, then drinking alcoholic beverages is not </div>
<div id="t8_139" class="t s1_139">a problem. Simple, like any drink -- Coca-Cola or Fanta. If you are a German, beer is </div>
<div id="t9_139" class="t s1_139">simply water. No problem in it. But if you are an Indian, then the difficulty arises. Even </div>
<div id="ta_139" class="t s1_139">COCA-COLA is a problem. Gandhi will not allow you to drink COCA-COLA. He had </div>
<div id="tb_139" class="t s1_139">prohibited tea in his ashram. Tea! It became a problem to him because it has some </div>
<div id="tc_139" class="t s1_139">quantity of caffeine in it. For Buddhists tea has never been a problem. It has been almost </div>
<div id="td_139" class="t s1_139">a religious ritual in Japan, in China. </div>
<div id="te_139" class="t s1_139">A Buddhist monk starts his life with tea. In the early morning, before he goes to meditate, </div>
<div id="tf_139" class="t s1_139">he takes tea. After he has meditated he takes tea, and takes it in such a religious way, with </div>
<div id="tg_139" class="t s1_139">such grace and dignity. It has never been thought of as a problem; in fact Buddhists </div>
<div id="th_139" class="t s1_139">discovered it. Legendarily it is connected with Bodhidharma. </div>
<div id="ti_139" class="t s1_139">Bodhidharma is thought to have discovered tea. He used to live on a hillside. The </div>
<div id="tj_139" class="t s1_139">mountain's name was Ta, and because the tea was first discovered there, that's why it is </div>
<div id="tk_139" class="t s1_139">called ta, tea, cha, chai -- they are all derivations from Ta. And why did Bodhidharma </div>
<div id="tl_139" class="t s1_139">discover it, and how did he discover it? </div>
<div id="tm_139" class="t s1_139">He was trying to attain to a point of absolute awareness. It is difficult. You can live </div>
<div id="tn_139" class="t s1_139">without food for many days, but without sleep? -- and he was trying not to allow any </div>
<div id="to_139" class="t s1_139">sleep. After a period -- seven, eight days -- suddenly he felt sleep coming. He tore away </div>
<div id="tp_139" class="t s1_139">his eyelids and threw them, so there would be no problem anymore. It is said those </div>
<div id="tq_139" class="t s1_139">eyelids fell into the ground, sprouted as tea. That's why tea helps awareness; if you drink </div>
<div id="tr_139" class="t s1_139">too much tea in the night you will not be able to sleep. And because the whole Buddhist </div>
<div id="ts_139" class="t s1_139">mind is how to attain to a point where sleep does not interfere and you can remain </div>
<div id="tt_139" class="t s1_139">perfectly aware, of course tea became almost a sacred thing, the holiest of the holies. </div>
<div id="tu_139" class="t s1_139">In Japan they have small houses in the monasteries -- teahouses. When they go to a tea-</div>
<div id="tv_139" class="t s1_139">house, they go as if somebody is going to church or to the temple. They take a bath; they </div>
<div id="tw_139" class="t s1_139">wear new fresh clothes; they leave their shoes outside; they move in silence, in grace; </div>
<div id="tx_139" class="t s1_139">they sit</div>
<div id="ty_139" class="t s1_139">....</div>
<div id="tz_139" class="t s1_139">And it is a long ritual. It is not just that you go and take a cup of tea and drink </div>
<div id="t10_139" class="t s1_139">and you are gone, not in such a hurry. Gods have to be treated well, and tea is a god, god </div>
<div id="t11_139" class="t s1_139">of awareness. So they will sit silently, and the kettle will go on singing its song, and first </div>
<div id="t12_139" class="t s1_139">they will listen to it. Now they are preparing. They will meditate on the singing kettle. </div>
<div id="t13_139" class="t s1_139">Then the cups and saucers will be given to them. They will touch the cups and saucers, </div>
<div id="t14_139" class="t s1_139">look at them, because they are pieces of art. And nobody likes to use cups and saucers </div>
<div id="t15_139" class="t s1_139">purchased from the market. Every monastery makes its own. Rich people make their </div>
<div id="t16_139" class="t s1_139">own. Poor people, if they cannot afford to make their own, purchase them from the </div>
<div id="t17_139" class="t s1_139">market, break them, reglue them; they become perfectly unique then. </div>
<div id="t18_139" class="t s1_139">Then the tea is poured. And everybody is in a deep, receptive, meditative mood, </div>
<div id="t19_139" class="t s1_139">breathing slow and deep. And then the tea is drunk, as if something divine is descending </div>
<div id="t1a_139" class="t s1_139">in you. </div>
<div id="t1b_139" class="t s1_139">Now Mahatma Gandhi cannot think of this. In his ashram tea was not allowed; tea was on </div>
<div id="t1c_139" class="t s1_139">the blacklist. It depends on your attitude. </div>
