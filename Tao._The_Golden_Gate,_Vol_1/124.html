<div id="t2_124" class="t s2_124">He was really angry – anybody would have been in his situation – but there was no point in being</div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s2_124">angry.</div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s2_124">Right now something had to done and he could not think of anything.</div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s2_124">The mind simply</div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s2_124">stopped.</div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s2_124">That’s what meditation is: the mind simply stops. It cannot ﬁgure out what it is all about, what to do,</div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s2_124">because all that it knows is useless; it has never been in such a situation before. And mind can only</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s2_124">move again and again in the world of the known. Whenever anything unknown is encountered, mind</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s2_124">stops. It is a machine. If you have not fed it the right information before, it cannot work, it cannot</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s2_124">function.</div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s2_124">Now this was such a new situation, the young man could not conceive what to do. There was nothing</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s2_124">to do. And then a woman servant came with a candle in her hand looking around for the thief. A thief</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s2_124">had certainly entered the house: the wall was broken, the door had been opened – all the doors had</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s2_124">been opened. The thief had entered the innermost room – he must be hiding somewhere.</div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s2_124">She opened the closet door to look in – maybe he was hiding inside. She would not have opened</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s2_124">the door of the closet, but something happened inside the closet, which was why she opened it. She</div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s2_124">heard some noise, some scratching noise as if a rat were biting clothes. She opened the door to</div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s2_124">look for the rat really. This was the young man making this scratching noise, he was doing it. And it</div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s2_124">had come to him spontaneously, it was not out of the mind. Seeing somebody entering with a light...</div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s2_124">he could see that somebody was inside the room, he could hear the footsteps, he could see the light</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s2_124">outside; suddenly it was not so dark. The only way to get the doors opened was to do something.</div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s2_124">What to do? Out of nowhere, intuitively – this is not out of intellect but out of intuition – he started</div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s2_124">scratching like a rat and the door was opened. The woman looked inside with her candle. Again,</div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s2_124">out of intuition, out of the moment, he blew out the candle, pushed the woman aside and ran away.</div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s2_124">The people followed – almost a dozen people were following him carrying torches and lamps – and</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s2_124">it was certain he would be caught. Suddenly he came across a well. He took a rock and threw the</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s2_124">rock into the well, then stood by the side of a tree to watch what happened. It was all HAPPENING,</div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s2_124">he was not doing it. All the people surrounded the well – they thought the thief had jumped into the</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s2_124">well. ”Now there is no point in bothering about him on this cold night. In the morning we can see. If</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s2_124">he is alive we will put him in the jail; if he is dead he is punished already.” They went back.</div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s2_124">The young man reached home. The father was fast asleep, snoring. He pulled his blanket aside and</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s2_124">he said, ”Are you mad or something?”</div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s2_124">The father looked at him, smiled and said, ”So you are back – that’s enough! No need to tell the</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s2_124">whole story. You are a born thief! From tomorrow you start on your own. You have caught the spirit</div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s2_124">of it. I am not mad – I gambled. Either you would be ﬁnished or you would come out of it proving that</div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s2_124">you have the intuitive insight – and you have come out of it. No need to bother me at this moment</div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s2_124">in the night. Go to sleep. In the morning, if you feel like telling me, you can tell me. But I know what</div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s2_124">has happened – if not the details, then the essence of it, and that’s enough. That’s my whole art,</div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s2_124">my son; you have learned it. And if I die tomorrow I will be dying happily because I will know I am</div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s2_124">leaving somebody who knows the art. This is how my father taught me – this is the only way. One</div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s2_124">has to risk.”</div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s2_124">Even a thief can become enlightened. Even a thief can live in the moment, can drop out of the mind.</div>
<div id="t18_124" class="t s2_124">Tao: The Golden Gate, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t19_124" class="t s2_124">124</div>
<div id="t1a_124" class="t s3_124">Osho</div>
