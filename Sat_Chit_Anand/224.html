<div id="t1_224" class="t s1_224">CHAPTER 20. RESPONSE ABILITY</div>
<div id="t2_224" class="t s2_224">The Taj Mahal is unique in the whole world, there is no other building that can be compared to</div>
<div id="t3_224" class="t s2_224">it. And it was made by a great emperor. It took thirty years in building, and almost ten thousand</div>
<div id="t4_224" class="t s2_224">stonecutters, sculptors ... Master builders were gathered from faraway countries, the best from Iran,</div>
<div id="t5_224" class="t s2_224">from Turkey, from Egypt, from Arabia. And the emperor who was making it had the whole empire of</div>
<div id="t6_224" class="t s2_224">India and all the money was pouring into it.</div>
<div id="t7_224" class="t s2_224">These ten thousand people worked almost ... When they had come they were young; by the time</div>
<div id="t8_224" class="t s2_224">the Taj Mahal was completed, either they were old or dead. The second generation was working.</div>
<div id="t9_224" class="t s2_224">Sometimes they had come old – they were famous so they were brought – so the third generation</div>
<div id="ta_224" class="t s2_224">was working.</div>
<div id="tb_224" class="t s2_224">And the emperor who was making it as a memorial to his wife, Mumtaj, was also making on the other</div>
<div id="tc_224" class="t s2_224">side of the river Jamuna his own memorial. When he died he would be buried there. Emperors took</div>
<div id="td_224" class="t s2_224">care while they were alive to make their memorial too, because after they were dead nobody was</div>
<div id="te_224" class="t s2_224">going to bother to put so much money and effort into it.</div>
<div id="tf_224" class="t s2_224">But his whole treasure was ﬁnished with the wife’s memorial.</div>
<div id="tg_224" class="t s2_224">His own memorial has only the</div>
<div id="th_224" class="t s2_224">foundation stones. He could not complete it because he was dethroned by his own son and kept in</div>
<div id="ti_224" class="t s2_224">jail. And the son immediately dropped the plan of the second memorial.</div>
<div id="tj_224" class="t s2_224">The Taj Mahal is made of white marble, all Italian marble. And the other memorial, just on the other</div>
<div id="tk_224" class="t s2_224">side of the river – at the end he was going to make a bridge – was going to be exactly the same as</div>
<div id="tl_224" class="t s2_224">the Taj Mahal, but in black marble. He was creating a beautiful symmetry. The architect was going</div>
<div id="tm_224" class="t s2_224">to be exactly the same, the building exactly the same, just the marble was going to be white on the</div>
<div id="tn_224" class="t s2_224">wife’s memorial and black on his own memorial.</div>
<div id="to_224" class="t s2_224">Now these followers wanted to try to make something better than the Taj Mahal, because thousands</div>
<div id="tp_224" class="t s2_224">of tourists were coming every day to see the Taj Mahal.</div>
<div id="tq_224" class="t s2_224">Naturally they thought it was not only</div>
<div id="tr_224" class="t s2_224">a question of prestige, it was also a question of business.</div>
<div id="ts_224" class="t s2_224">It had been going on for almost one</div>
<div id="tt_224" class="t s2_224">hundred years.</div>
<div id="tu_224" class="t s2_224">They had been able to make only the ground ﬂoor. Certainly they have made it far better than the</div>
<div id="tv_224" class="t s2_224">Taj Mahal, but there seems to be no possibility that they will be able to complete it. They wanted</div>
<div id="tw_224" class="t s2_224">to make it a three-story building, so it goes higher than the Taj Mahal, but all the money that they</div>
<div id="tx_224" class="t s2_224">could collect from their followers from all over India is ﬁnished. For one hundred years continuously</div>
<div id="ty_224" class="t s2_224">thousands of workers have been involved in making it.</div>
<div id="tz_224" class="t s2_224">I have seen ... Their pillars are so beautiful, so creative: on the pillars they have made creepers</div>
<div id="t10_224" class="t s2_224">in marble. And the creepers have green ﬂowers of green marble and roses on top of the creepers</div>
<div id="t11_224" class="t s2_224">made in rubies, emeralds, diamonds. They have certainly made it clear that if they complete it –</div>
<div id="t12_224" class="t s2_224">even incomplete – it has gone beyond the Taj Mahal. They are immensely happy. They invited me</div>
<div id="t13_224" class="t s2_224">when I was speaking at Agra University ... They invited me to show me their incomplete memorial.</div>
<div id="t14_224" class="t s2_224">They have done a tremendously great job.</div>
<div id="t15_224" class="t s2_224">They took me inside. Inside they have a map drawn on the marble and on the map there are fourteen</div>
<div id="t16_224" class="t s2_224">divisions. And they have put all the enlightened people that they could think of in the division to</div>
<div id="t17_224" class="t s2_224">which he belongs. There are not only three categories ... According to them there are fourteen.</div>
<div id="t18_224" class="t s2_224">Sat Chit Anand</div>
<div id="t19_224" class="t s2_224">224</div>
<div id="t1a_224" class="t s3_224">Osho</div>
