<div id="t2_181" class="t s1_181">don't need it. You can keep it. When I need it I will come back." </div>
<div id="t3_181" class="t s1_181">Once you are a prime minister you don't need the mind. </div>
<div id="t4_181" class="t s1_181">I have heard another story too: </div>
<div id="t5_181" class="t s1_181">A man -- it must be some future story -- a man went to the hospital because his brain </div>
<div id="t6_181" class="t s1_181">was damaged in a car accident and he wanted a new brain. So he asked the surgeon to </div>
<div id="t7_181" class="t s1_181">show him all kinds of brains available. The surgeon took him around; there were many </div>
<div id="t8_181" class="t s1_181">brains. </div>
<div id="t9_181" class="t s1_181">The first brain belonged to a professor, a mathematician. He asked the price -- fifty </div>
<div id="ta_181" class="t s1_181">dollars. He was surprised: a famous mathematician, a Nobel laureate, just fifty dollars' </div>
<div id="tb_181" class="t s1_181">worth! Then there was a musician and his was only thirty dollars. Then there was a </div>
<div id="tc_181" class="t s1_181">businessman's brain and it was only twenty dollars. And so on, so forth. </div>
<div id="td_181" class="t s1_181">Finally they came to the brain of a politician -- it was five thousand dollars! The man </div>
<div id="te_181" class="t s1_181">was puzzled. He said, "Why does it costs so much?" </div>
<div id="tf_181" class="t s1_181">The surgeon says, "Because it has never been used. All the other brains are secondhand, </div>
<div id="tg_181" class="t s1_181">this is brand-new." </div>
<div id="th_181" class="t s1_181">Narayano, if you throw the brain out, then you will have to go into politics, that's all. </div>
<div id="ti_181" class="t s1_181">Then you cannot be a sannyasin: a sannyasin needs more intelligence than anybody </div>
<div id="tj_181" class="t s1_181">else. So please don't ask me how to do it. And don't do it on your own -- because </div>
<div id="tk_181" class="t s1_181">sometimes people do, and then fixing it is very difficult. </div>
<div id="tl_181" class="t s1_181">William had a big problem with his wife, Lisa. Every night before she went to bed she </div>
<div id="tm_181" class="t s1_181">would stop at the door, start running and then with a big jump leap into the bed. He got </div>
<div id="tn_181" class="t s1_181">so upset about this habit of hers that he decided to do something about it. So one night </div>
<div id="to_181" class="t s1_181">when she was asleep he got up, went to the fridge, got a big piece of beef liver out of it </div>
<div id="tp_181" class="t s1_181">and placed it on the floor in front of the bed. </div>
<div id="tq_181" class="t s1_181">The next morning he got up and said, "My God, Lisa, look what has happened -- your </div>
<div id="tr_181" class="t s1_181">uterus has fallen out! I always told you to stop your jumping." Lisa was very shocked. </div>
<div id="ts_181" class="t s1_181">When he came home that evening from work he said, "Now, Lisa, you see what can </div>
<div id="tt_181" class="t s1_181">happen with a bad habit like this." </div>
<div id="tu_181" class="t s1_181">She replied, "Oh, that was not so bad. You should have seen how much trouble it was to </div>
<div id="tv_181" class="t s1_181">get it in again." </div>
<div id="tw_181" class="t s1_181">So Narayano, please don't do it! It is easy to throw it out, it is very difficult to get it back </div>
<div id="tx_181" class="t s1_181">in. You will need all the mind that you have. Just be the master of it. Use it, and don't be </div>
<div id="ty_181" class="t s1_181">used by it. </div>
<div id="tz_181" class="t s1_181">And that's what meditation is all about: the art of moving away from the mind, being </div>
<div id="t10_181" class="t s1_181">above the mind, becoming transcendental to the mind, knowing that "I am not the </div>
<div id="t11_181" class="t s1_181">mind." That does not mean that you have to throw out the mind. Knowing that "I am </div>
