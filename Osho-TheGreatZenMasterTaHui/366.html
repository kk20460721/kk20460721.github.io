<div id="t1_366" class="t s1_366">(EMBLEMATIC OF SUCCESSION TO THE PATRIARCHS). In Zen, every patriarch gives</div>
<div id="t2_366" class="t s1_366">his robe and his bowl to his successor, and naturally there is great competition and human</div>
<div id="t3_366" class="t s1_366">frailties, jealousies ...</div>
<div id="t4_366" class="t s1_366">This man, Hui Ming, was far more learned, in every way far more cultured. He had</div>
<div id="t5_366" class="t s1_366">renounced the great post of general, and had become a disciple; he had practiced for a long</div>
<div id="t6_366" class="t s1_366">time. But the master chose a very strange man, Hui Neng, to be his successor. In his</div>
<div id="t7_366" class="t s1_366">monastery there were at least twelve thousand monks, and not a single one would have</div>
<div id="t8_366" class="t s1_366">thought that Hui Neng was going to become the successor.</div>
<div id="t9_366" class="t s1_366">Hui Neng's only accomplishment was that since he had come, twenty years before, he had</div>
<div id="ta_366" class="t s1_366">been cleaning the rice for the twelve thousand monks from the early morning till late at night.</div>
<div id="tb_366" class="t s1_366">For twenty years he had not done anything else. He had never been in any of the discourses of</div>
<div id="tc_366" class="t s1_366">the master, he had never read any scripture -- in fact he was illiterate. He was a villager, but a</div>
<div id="td_366" class="t s1_366">man of tremendous determination.</div>
<div id="te_366" class="t s1_366">The day he got initiated, Hui Neng asked the master, "What am I supposed to do?"</div>
<div id="tf_366" class="t s1_366">The master said, "Go to the mess, clean rice and never again come back to me" -- and he</div>
<div id="tg_366" class="t s1_366">never came back again. Twenty years of silently waiting ... because the master had said, "If it</div>
<div id="th_366" class="t s1_366">is needed, I will come to you. But you should never again show your face to me. You simply</div>
<div id="ti_366" class="t s1_366">clean the rice from morning till night, then go to sleep; again clean the rice, then go to sleep."</div>
<div id="tj_366" class="t s1_366">You can understand, twenty years just cleaning rice and going to sleep, his mind became</div>
<div id="tk_366" class="t s1_366">silent. No meditation was needed. He never went to any discourse -- there was no time.</div>
<div id="tl_366" class="t s1_366">Nobody talked to him because he was thought to be of the lowest category, just a poor villager</div>
<div id="tm_366" class="t s1_366">who knows nothing, and he never asked anything of anybody. People passed by him as if he</div>
<div id="tn_366" class="t s1_366">was not there. He was taken for granted.</div>
<div id="to_366" class="t s1_366">The day came for the master to leave his body, and he said, "Before I leave my body I want</div>
<div id="tp_366" class="t s1_366">to choose my successor. The way I want to choose is this: whoever knows the right answer</div>
<div id="tq_366" class="t s1_366">should come in the night and write it on my door; if the answer is right, he will receive my</div>
<div id="tr_366" class="t s1_366">robe and my bowl."</div>
<div id="ts_366" class="t s1_366">This ex-general, Hui Ming, was certainly the most important person of the whole</div>
<div id="tt_366" class="t s1_366">following of the master, and everybody thought that he would be the winner. So he went in the</div>
<div id="tu_366" class="t s1_366">night and he wrote on the door, "No-mind is the answer." But he was so afraid of the master --</div>
<div id="tv_366" class="t s1_366">afraid that if it is found to be wrong he is going to get a good beating -- that he did not sign it.</div>
<div id="tw_366" class="t s1_366">He thought, "If it is right then I will declare that I have written it; if it is wrong then it is better</div>
<div id="tx_366" class="t s1_366">to keep silent."</div>
<div id="ty_366" class="t s1_366">In the morning when the master woke up he said, "Who is that idiot?" Hearing this, Hui</div>
<div id="tz_366" class="t s1_366">Ming escaped from the monastery -- somebody may inform the master because a few people</div>
<div id="t10_366" class="t s1_366">had got the idea ... they were looking out for who was going to write. In fact it was public</div>
<div id="t11_366" class="t s1_366">knowledge that it was Hui Ming!</div>
<div id="t12_366" class="t s1_366">Two monks, after taking their food, were just passing by Hui Neng and discussing, saying,</div>
<div id="t13_366" class="t s1_366">"The master is too hard. The answer seems to be right: "no-mind" is the whole philosophy of</div>
<div id="t14_366" class="t s1_366">Gautam Buddha. What more can be said?" People had completely forgotten that Hui Neng</div>
<div id="t15_366" class="t s1_366">even speaks; for twenty years he had not spoken a single word to anybody. He simply did his</div>
<div id="t16_366" class="t s1_366">work, would go to sleep, wake up, start his work again. That day, listening to those two monks</div>
<div id="t17_366" class="t s1_366">saying that the answer seems to be right and the master is too hard, he laughed. Those two</div>
<div id="t18_366" class="t s1_366">monks stopped and they said, "Why are you laughing?"</div>
<div id="t19_366" class="t s1_366">Chapter 32 - Desirelessness</div>
<div id="t1a_366" class="t s1_366">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
