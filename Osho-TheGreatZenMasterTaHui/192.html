<div id="t2_192" class="t s1_192">But he stood up. He said, "I am going home. First I have to ask my wife. I never do such</div>
<div id="t3_192" class="t s1_192">strange things without asking her; she is a very pragmatic woman."</div>
<div id="t4_192" class="t s1_192">I said, "It is up to you, but it has never happened in the whole history that somebody who</div>
<div id="t5_192" class="t s1_192">becomes enlightened first asks the permission of his wife. You become enlightened; then you</div>
<div id="t6_192" class="t s1_192">simply go and declare your enlightenment."</div>
<div id="t7_192" class="t s1_192">He said, "At least give me some time to think."</div>
<div id="t8_192" class="t s1_192">Then I said, "But such a day may not come again so soon. Today everything is ready."</div>
<div id="t9_192" class="t s1_192">He said, "I can wait. It will do even if it comes two or three years later."</div>
<div id="ta_192" class="t s1_192">And from that day he started avoiding me. If I was sitting in the common room he would</div>
<div id="tb_192" class="t s1_192">not enter. He made sure that I was not in the university; then he would move everywhere</div>
<div id="tc_192" class="t s1_192">freely. He would make sure that I was not in the library; then he would go to the library.</div>
<div id="td_192" class="t s1_192">One day I arrived at his home. I said, "The day has come again."</div>
<div id="te_192" class="t s1_192">He said, "My God, I have been avoiding you all this time, and just within three months the</div>
<div id="tf_192" class="t s1_192">day has come again? My wife is absolutely against it!"</div>
<div id="tg_192" class="t s1_192">And then his wife came out and she said, "You should not make him enlightened. He is</div>
<div id="th_192" class="t s1_192">already a trouble, a nuisance. If he becomes enlightened our whole family's life will be</div>
<div id="ti_192" class="t s1_192">disturbed. Even in his ignorance he is not what a husband should be and if he becomes</div>
<div id="tj_192" class="t s1_192">enlightened I can visualize troubles and more troubles. You just leave him alone! He has been</div>
<div id="tk_192" class="t s1_192">avoiding you for three months because of my advice. Now this is too much that you have</div>
<div id="tl_192" class="t s1_192">started coming to our house."</div>
<div id="tm_192" class="t s1_192">And you will not believe that the next day he went to the capital and got himself</div>
<div id="tn_192" class="t s1_192">transferred from that university to another university. After two or three days -- I had been</div>
<div id="to_192" class="t s1_192">looking for him -- I went again to his home and the neighbor said, "They are gone!"</div>
<div id="tp_192" class="t s1_192">I asked, "What was the problem?"</div>
<div id="tq_192" class="t s1_192">He said, "You were the problem."</div>
<div id="tr_192" class="t s1_192">I said, "I was simply trying to make him enlightened."</div>
<div id="ts_192" class="t s1_192">Enlightenment is such a simple thing that nobody needs to be worried about it. But it has</div>
<div id="tt_192" class="t s1_192">become such ... Down the ages religions have been insisting that it is a very great</div>
<div id="tu_192" class="t s1_192">phenomenon; it is not for ordinary mortals, it is only for those who have some special</div>
<div id="tv_192" class="t s1_192">dispensation from God. Ordinary mortals should not try for it because that is trying for the</div>
<div id="tw_192" class="t s1_192">impossible. It is good for a Gautam Buddha because he is an incarnation of God. It is good for</div>
<div id="tx_192" class="t s1_192">Krishna because he is an incarnation of God, but ordinary people are not incarnations of God.</div>
<div id="ty_192" class="t s1_192">And I have been arguing my whole life with people that Gautam Buddha was not an</div>
<div id="tz_192" class="t s1_192">incarnation of God before he became enlightened. Enlightenment came to him first; then you</div>
<div id="t10_192" class="t s1_192">recognized him as an incarnation of God. Neither was Krishna accepted as an incarnation of</div>
<div id="t11_192" class="t s1_192">God until he became enlightened. So your whole logic is false. You try to be enlightened and</div>
<div id="t12_192" class="t s1_192">then people will accept you as a reincarnation of God.</div>
