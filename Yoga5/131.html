<div id="t1_131" class="t s1_131">And this is difficult to understand: if without contentment you try to be austere, </div>
<div id="t2_131" class="t s1_131">your austerity will be complex. </div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s1_131">It happened once, I was travelling in a first-class compartment with another </div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s1_131">sannyasi. I didn't know him, he didn't know me, but we were the only two </div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s1_131">passengers in the compartment. Many people at a certain station came to pay </div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s1_131">their respects to him; he must have been a very well-known man. He had </div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s1_131">nothing, just a small bag, maybe one or two dresses, and just a small lunghi, just </div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s1_131">covering up to the knees; and he was almost naked. And that lunghi was also </div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s1_131">made of the most inexpensive cloth possible. </div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s1_131">Then, when we travelled together, by and by I became aware of his complexities; </div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s1_131">he was a simple man as far as the outward appearance is concerned. When the </div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s1_131">station passed and the people had gone and the train started and he saw that I </div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s1_131">was dozing, I had closed my eyes, immediately, he pulled something out of his </div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s1_131">bag. I was not asleep. I looked -- he was counting notes, somebody may have </div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s1_131">presented to him. Not many notes, must not have been more than a hundred </div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s1_131">rupees, but the way he was counting -- with such gusto, such lust that I couldn't </div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s1_131">believe. </div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s1_131">Seeing that I was seeing, he immediately pushed the notes inside the bag and sat </div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s1_131">in a Buddha-posture again on the seat. Now this is complexity. If you are </div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s1_131">counting you are counting. What does it matter if I see or not? Why hide it? Why </div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s1_131">feel guilty about it? If you are enjoying counting notes, nothing is wrong -- </div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s1_131">innocent, harmless. But no, he felt guilty: that a sannyasi should not touch notes, </div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s1_131">and he has been caught. </div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s1_131">Then, he was to get down at a station which was to come in the early morning, </div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s1_131">six o'clock. Wherever the train would stop, he was again and again asking -- two </div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s1_131">o'clock in the night and he will lean out of the window and ask -- which station it </div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s1_131">is. He was disturbing my sleep so much that I told him, "Don't be worried. It is </div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s1_131">not going to come before six o'clock. And this train does not go further than that </div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s1_131">station -- so you need not worry. Even if you are fast asleep you cannot miss the </div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s1_131">station -- that is going to be the last stop." But he couldn't sleep the whole night. </div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s1_131">He was so tense; and I could not understand what was the restlessness. </div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s1_131">In the morning, when the station was coming nearer, I saw him standing before </div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s1_131">the mirror. Nothing to arrange, just one small lunghi, but he was binding it again </div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s1_131">and again and looking in the mirror and watching whether it looks good or not. </div>
<div id="tz_131" class="t s1_131">Then he again found me looking. He was shocked. When I would close my eyes </div>
<div id="t10_131" class="t s1_131">then he would do something else; if I would open my eyes he would </div>
<div id="t11_131" class="t s1_131">immediately stop it. So guilty about everything. </div>
<div id="t12_131" class="t s1_131">This man has not attained to contentment, and he has done austerity. He remains </div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s1_131">an ordinary man of desire. I'm not saying there is anything wrong in looking in </div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s1_131">the mirror -- nothing is wrong. The wrong happens only when somebody else is </div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s1_131">looking -- why you are shocked. It is beautiful, you can look -- it is your face. You </div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s1_131">can look in the mirror. You are authorized, at least for your own face. And </div>
