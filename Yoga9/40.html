<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">surface of things. You touch but your touch has no warmth; nothing flows in and out </div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s1_40">from your touch. You hear also. The birds go on singing and you hear and you can say, </div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s1_40">"Yes, I am hearing," and you are not wrong -- you are hearing -- but it never reaches to </div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s1_40">the very core of your being. It does not go dancing within you; it doesn't help a flowering, </div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s1_40">an unfolding within you. </div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s1_40">These senses have to be rejuvenated. Yoga is not against the body, remember. Yoga says </div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s1_40">go beyond the body, but it is not against the body. Yoga says use the body, don't be used </div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s1_40">by it; but it is not against the body. Yoga says the body is your temple. You are in the </div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s1_40">body, and the body is so beautiful an organism, so complex and so subtle, so mysterious, </div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s1_40">and so many dimensions open through it. And those senses are the only doors and </div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s1_40">windows through which you will reach to God -- so don't deaden them. Make them more </div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s1_40">alive. Let them vibrate, pulsate, and, what Stanley Keleman has said, let them "stream." </div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s1_40">That is exactly the right word: let them flow like a stream, rushing. You can have the </div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s1_40">sensation. Your hand, if it is rushing like a stream of energy: you will feel a tingling </div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s1_40">sensation, you will feel something inside the hand is flowing and wants to make contact, </div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s1_40">wants to be connected. </div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s1_40">When you love a woman or a man and you take her hand in your hand, if your hand is not </div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s1_40">streaming, this love is not going to be of any use. If your hand is not jumping and </div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s1_40">throbbing with energy and pouring energy into your woman or into your man, then this </div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s1_40">love is almost dead from the very beginning. Then this child is not born alive. Then </div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s1_40">sooner or later you will be finished -- you are already finished. It will take a little time to </div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s1_40">recognize because your mind is also dull; otherwise you would not have entered into it, </div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s1_40">because it is already dead. For what are you entering? You take time to recognize things </div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s1_40">because your sensitivity, brilliance, intelligence, is so much clouded and confused. </div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s1_40">Only a streaming love can become a source of blissfulness, of joy, of delight. But for that </div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s1_40">you will need senses streaming. </div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s1_40">Sometimes you have that glimpse also; and everybody had it when he was a child. Watch </div>
<div id="ts_40" class="t s1_40">a child running after a butterfly. He is streaming, as if any moment he can jump out of his </div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s1_40">body. Watch a child when he is looking at a rose flower. See his eyes, the brilliance, the </div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s1_40">light that comes to his eyes. He is streaming. His eyes are almost dancing on the petals of </div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s1_40">the flower. </div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s1_40">This is the way to be: be riverlike. And only then is it possible to master these senses. In </div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s1_40">fact people have had a very wrong attitude. They think that if you want to master your </div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s1_40">senses you have to make them almost dead. But then what is the point of mastering? You </div>
<div id="tz_40" class="t s1_40">can kill, and you are the master. You can sit on the corpse. But what is the point of being </div>
<div id="t10_40" class="t s1_40">a master? But this looked easier: first to kill them, and then you can master. If the body </div>
<div id="t11_40" class="t s1_40">feels too strong, fast. Make it weak, and then you start feeling that you are the master. </div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s1_40">But you have killed the body. Remember, life has to be mastered, not dead things. They </div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s1_40">will not be of any use. </div>
<div id="t14_40" class="t s1_40">But this has been found to be a shortcut, so all the religions of the world have been using </div>
<div id="t15_40" class="t s1_40">it. Destroy your body by and by. Disconnect yourself from the body. Don't be in contact. </div>
<div id="t16_40" class="t s1_40">Remove yourself away. Become indifferent. When your body is almost a dead tree; no </div>
<div id="t17_40" class="t s1_40">longer do leaves come to it, no longer does it flower, no longer do birds come to rest. It is </div>
<div id="t18_40" class="t s1_40">just a dead stump. Of course you can master it, but now what are you going to gain from </div>
<div id="t19_40" class="t s1_40">this mastery? </div>
<div id="t1a_40" class="t s1_40">This is the problem; that's why people don't understand what Patanjali means. </div>
