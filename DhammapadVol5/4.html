<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">faraway places just to have a glimpse of Buddha's palace in the full moon, just as people </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">go to see the Taj Mahal. White marble has a tremendous beauty when the moon is full. </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">There is some synchronicity between the full moon and white marble, a certain </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">harmony, a rhythm, a communion. </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">The charioteer said, "Look back at least once at your beautiful palace. Nobody has such </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">a beautiful palace." </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">Buddha looked back and told the old man, "I don't see any palace there but only great </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">fire. The palace is on fire, only flames. Simply leave me and go back; if you see the </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">palace, go back to the palace. I don't see any palace there -- because death is arriving </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">every moment, and I don't see any palace there because all palaces disappear sooner or </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">later. In this world everything is momentary and I am in search of the eternal. Seeing </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">the momentariness of this world I can no longer befool myself." </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">These are his exact words, "I cannot befool myself anymore." </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">Not that he is renouncing the world! What can he do? If you see something as rubbish, </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">if you see that the stones that you have carried all along are not real diamonds, what are </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">you going to do with them? It will not need great courage to drop them, to throw them </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">away; it will not need great intelligence to get rid of them. They will immediately fall </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">from your hands. You were not clinging to those stones but to the idea that they were </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">diamonds. You were clinging to your fallacy, your illusion. </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">Buddha has not renounced the world, he has renounced his illusions about it. And that </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">too is a happening, not an act. When renunciation comes as a happening it has a </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">tremendous beauty, because there is no motive in it. It is not a means to gain something </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">else. It is total. You are finished with desiring, you are finished with future, you are </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">finished with power, money, prestige, because you have seen the futility of it all. </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">Seeing is transformation. Remember this as the very fundamental; then these sutras will </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">have a totally different meaning to you. The meaning depends on the context. If you </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">place these sutras in a wrong context they will have a different meaning, and that's </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">what has happened to Buddha. </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">I repeat: he has been misunderstood more than anybody else in the world. And the </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">reason is that he is one of the most profound masters of the world. His insight is so deep </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">that it is bound to be misunderstood. </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">Jesus speaks to the common masses in parables, in simple language. He is not a </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">philosopher; he is not very educated or cultured either. He is a son of the earth. He had </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">been working for years with his father as a carpenter -- carrying wood from the forest, </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">cutting wood, helping the old man. </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">Buddha is a totally different kind of person. He is not a son of the earth, he is a prince. </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">He has never mixed with the crowds, he does not know their language. He speaks a </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">language which can be understood only by the very sophisticated. He tried hard to </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">bring it to the level of the masses, but it is almost impossible. And it is not only a </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">question of language either. </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">Jesus talks about prayer, which is simple to understand, because prayer is a duality and </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">the whole world consists of dualities. Prayer is a duality because it is a dialogue </div>
<div id="t17_4" class="t s1_4">between you and an imaginary God, but still a dialogue. In prayer you are again </div>
