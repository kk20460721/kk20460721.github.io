<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">own being, who are not yet even aware that there is an inner world. Devices can be </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">created on the outside which can help. </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">Listening to great music you suddenly become silent -- with no effort. Falling in tune </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">with the music you lose your ego with no effort. You become relaxed, you fall into a </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">deep rest. You are alert, awake, and yet in a subtle way drunk. </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">Once it happened: </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">A great musician came to the court of a king. The musician must have been an </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">awakened master, must have been a buddha. He said to the king, "I will play on my </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">instruments, but you will have to fulfill one of my conditions. Unless this condition is </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">fulfilled I cannot play." </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">The king said, "Whatsoever the condition is, it will be fulfilled. You say it." He had </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">never thought what the condition could be: "Maybe he will ask for much money -- that </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">can be given easily -- or for some other favor which can be given easily." The king had </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">been waiting a long time for this man. </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">But the condition was very eccentric. The condition was: "While I am playing nobody </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">should move his head. If anybody moves his head, his head has to be cut off. So the </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">audience has to be informed beforehand that people should come knowing that they are </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">playing with fire. If they start moving their heads in tune with the music, then they will </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">lose their heads -- make it clear to everyone who comes. And surrounding the audience </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">let at least one thousand soldiers stand with naked swords so everybody remains aware </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">and never forgets." </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">The king was so interested in hearing the musician -- he had heard about him for years </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">and he was not ready to lose this opportunity even at this cost. Of course, whatsoever </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">he was demanding was simply insane, but the king had to agree. He said, "Okay, your </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">condition will be fulfilled." </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">The whole capital was informed. Thousands of people would have come, but now they </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">were afraid -- only one thousand people came to listen to the musician. Even seeing one </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">thousand people come, the king was surprised: "So many lovers who are risking their </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">lives!" And one thousand soldiers were standing with naked swords. Again it was </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">declared, "You have to remember and go on looking at the swords -- they are standing </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">for you. Nobody can escape." And there were people standing who would take notes -- </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">whoever shook his head, moved his head, would not reach home alive. </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">The musician started playing, and he was such a master! After only a few minutes, a </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">few heads started moving in tune with the master's music. The king was very much </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">afraid. He saw heads moving, swaying -- people were getting drunk. He himself was </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">afraid for his own head! But a tremendous desire arose in him too, he could not resist it. </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">He himself started moving his head, he forgot all about it. What to say about the </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">audience? The people who were standing with naked swords, many of them started </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">moving their heads and their swords were swaying! </div>
