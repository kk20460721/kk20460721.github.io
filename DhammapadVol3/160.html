<div id="t1_160" class="t s1_160">Zen masters are really experts in beating... not only beating; sometimes throwing you </div>
<div id="t2_160" class="t s1_160">out of the window, sometimes closing the door in your face. They can do anything to </div>
<div id="t3_160" class="t s1_160">wake you up, their compassion is such. And you are again given a good beating, and </div>
<div id="t4_160" class="t s1_160">the master shouts that you are utterly stupid: "This is not it. Go again and meditate." </div>
<div id="t5_160" class="t s1_160">And so on, so forth, it continues, continues, many answers. And no answer is ever </div>
<div id="t6_160" class="t s1_160">accepted; no answer can ever be accepted. </div>
<div id="t7_160" class="t s1_160">Sometimes it happens, even before the disciple has said what answer he has got, the </div>
<div id="t8_160" class="t s1_160">master starts beating him -- because it is not a question of what answer he brings; that is </div>
<div id="t9_160" class="t s1_160">utterly irrelevant. Whatsoever answer he has brought is going to be wrong. All answers </div>
<div id="ta_160" class="t s1_160">are wrong. </div>
<div id="tb_160" class="t s1_160">But one day he comes and the master hugs him, because he can see in his eyes, the way </div>
<div id="tc_160" class="t s1_160">he walks, the grace that surrounds him, the climate that he has brought with himself, </div>
<div id="td_160" class="t s1_160">the silence: no question, no answer. Not that he has brought any answer; on the </div>
<div id="te_160" class="t s1_160">contrary, this time he has come even without the question, he has forgotten the question </div>
<div id="tf_160" class="t s1_160">itself. He is not asking any more. He comes utterly silent, not even a ripple in his mind. </div>
<div id="tg_160" class="t s1_160">And the master recognizes it immediately. </div>
<div id="th_160" class="t s1_160">Sometimes it has happened that the disciple has not turned up and the master had to </div>
<div id="ti_160" class="t s1_160">seek and search for the disciple, because he felt deep down in his heart that the question </div>
<div id="tj_160" class="t s1_160">had disappeared. And now the disciple is feeling, "Why bother the master </div>
<div id="tk_160" class="t s1_160">unnecessarily? What is the point? There is no answer, no question." And the silence is </div>
<div id="tl_160" class="t s1_160">such, and it is so tremendous, that he does not want to come out of it. </div>
<div id="tm_160" class="t s1_160">And the master comes and says to him, "Now that you have the answer, what are you </div>
<div id="tn_160" class="t s1_160">doing here? Why didn't you turn up? I have been waiting for you." </div>
<div id="to_160" class="t s1_160">Once it happened: </div>
<div id="tp_160" class="t s1_160">When Rinzai was taking leave of his master -- because the master had said, "You go for </div>
<div id="tq_160" class="t s1_160">a three-year pilgrimage, go to all the temples and all the monasteries" -- and before he </div>
<div id="tr_160" class="t s1_160">was leaving, he started beating him. Rinzai said, "But I have not said anything, I have </div>
<div id="ts_160" class="t s1_160">not done anything. What kind of farewell is this? I am going for a three-year pilgrimage </div>
<div id="tt_160" class="t s1_160">on foot" -- in those ancient days it was dangerous -- "I may come back, I may not come </div>
<div id="tu_160" class="t s1_160">back." </div>
<div id="tv_160" class="t s1_160">The master said, "That's why. I may not have another chance to beat you. I am </div>
<div id="tw_160" class="t s1_160">suspicious. You are just on the verge of that great silence descending. Just the last part </div>
<div id="tx_160" class="t s1_160">of the question, not even 'Who am I?' but only the question mark is there. And any day </div>
<div id="ty_160" class="t s1_160">it will disappear, and then nobody knows whether you will come or you may not come. </div>
<div id="tz_160" class="t s1_160">And I am an old man; where will I come and search and seek you? This is my last </div>
<div id="t10_160" class="t s1_160">opportunity to beat you -- I cannot miss it!" </div>
<div id="t11_160" class="t s1_160">And yes, it was so; it was the last opportunity. Rinzai came back after three years, but </div>
<div id="t12_160" class="t s1_160">he was enlightened. He came back and slapped the master and said, "You rascal! You </div>
<div id="t13_160" class="t s1_160">were right. Just once I also want to hit you. You have been beating me at least for </div>
<div id="t14_160" class="t s1_160">twenty years. Just for once...!" </div>
<div id="t15_160" class="t s1_160">The master was laughing and he said, "You are entitled. You can do it whenever you </div>
<div id="t16_160" class="t s1_160">feel like doing it, but just remember that I am a very old man." </div>
