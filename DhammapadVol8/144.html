<div id="t2_144" class="t s1_144">absurd. They simply find some inner communion; something happens to their heart, </div>
<div id="t3_144" class="t s1_144">not to their head. And when something happens to the heart it is unanswerable. </div>
<div id="t4_144" class="t s1_144">But a few people become sannyasins out of the head; then they are only pseudo </div>

<div id="t6_144" class="t s1_144">So this much can be said: one who can answer WHY he has become a sannyasin is a </div>
<div id="t7_144" class="t s1_144">wrong sannyasin, a pseudo sannyasin; the real one can only shrug his shoulders. He </div>
<div id="t8_144" class="t s1_144">can say, "I don't know, it simply happened." He will not be convincing to you -- he can't </div>
<div id="t9_144" class="t s1_144">be -- but try to be sympathetic with the person. It is a love affair. </div>
<div id="ta_144" class="t s1_144">Who has ever been able to say why he has fallen in love? One simply falls in love for no </div>

<div id="tc_144" class="t s1_144">figure out why. The why is unanswerable. And whenever it is answerable, the person is </div>
<div id="td_144" class="t s1_144">not a real sannyasin. This is the paradox: those who can answer, they are not real </div>
<div id="te_144" class="t s1_144">sannyasins; those who cannot answer, they are real sannyasins. </div>

<div id="tp_144" class="t s1_144">"You should meet my wife," came the weary reply. </div>
