<div id="t1_97" class="t s1_97">CHAPTER 6. TRUTH IS NOT A DEBATE</div>
<div id="t2_97" class="t s2_97">understand him. You cannot understand anyone just by following. It is very easy to follow anyone, but</div>
<div id="t3_97" class="t s2_97">it is difﬁcult to be a disciple. It is very easy to follow or to copy others, but it is difﬁcult to understand</div>
<div id="t4_97" class="t s2_97">someone and then to develop your life according to that understanding.</div>
<div id="t5_97" class="t s2_97">So those who followed Shankara announced his universal victory.</div>
<div id="t6_97" class="t s2_97">They are still doing so.</div>
<div id="t7_97" class="t s2_97">The</div>
<div id="t8_97" class="t s2_97">Shankaracharya of Puri is still doing so, Karpatri is still doing so.</div>
<div id="t9_97" class="t s2_97">They still go on saying that</div>
<div id="ta_97" class="t s2_97">Shankara defeated the whole world. The Shankaracharya of Puri still says that he is Jagat Guru,</div>
<div id="tb_97" class="t s2_97">master of the world. This is not Shankara’s announcement, because Shankara knew that nobody</div>
<div id="tc_97" class="t s2_97">wins and nobody is defeated with logic – it only means that the other person’s logic was weaker than</div>
<div id="td_97" class="t s2_97">yours and you were more skilled. But tomorrow the other person can also become more skilled in</div>
<div id="te_97" class="t s2_97">logic.</div>
<div id="tf_97" class="t s2_97">Shankara knew that the victory of logic and argument is no victory, it is only a deception.</div>
<div id="tg_97" class="t s2_97">And</div>
<div id="th_97" class="t s2_97">Shankara is not attempting to defeat anyone with logic.</div>
<div id="ti_97" class="t s2_97">His attempt is unique, but this unique</div>
<div id="tj_97" class="t s2_97">attempt cannot be seen by those who are following him; they will only see that he defeated another</div>
<div id="tk_97" class="t s2_97">man. Those who are following him can understand only the language of the ego. They cannot see</div>
<div id="tl_97" class="t s2_97">that actually Shankara did not defeat the person but made him victorious, he brought him on the</div>
<div id="tm_97" class="t s2_97">path of the heart. A person was losing, sinking deep into logic – Shankara saved him and showed</div>
<div id="tn_97" class="t s2_97">him the path of victory. Now that person will be victorious.</div>
<div id="to_97" class="t s2_97">That is why people like Kumaril Bhatt, who was defeated by Shankara, became his disciple – he</div>
<div id="tp_97" class="t s2_97">did not become his disciple in misery and anguish. If Kumaril Bhatt had become a disciple after</div>
<div id="tq_97" class="t s2_97">being defeated then it would have hurt his ego and he would have tried to take the revenge of his</div>
<div id="tr_97" class="t s2_97">defeat. Kumaril was as great a logician as Shankara. By debating with Shankara Kumaril realized</div>
<div id="ts_97" class="t s2_97">that debating is futile. Shankara was not victorious, Kumaril was not defeated. Logic was defeated</div>
<div id="tt_97" class="t s2_97">and emotion won.</div>
<div id="tu_97" class="t s2_97">It is necessary to understand this – by debating with Shankara, by playing with an expert player,</div>
<div id="tv_97" class="t s2_97">Kumaril saw clearly that those things on which he depended fell down with just the blowing of a</div>
<div id="tw_97" class="t s2_97">breeze. This does not mean that he accepted Shankara’s logic. Shankara’s skill is only that, through</div>
<div id="tx_97" class="t s2_97">debate, he shows you that your arguments are futile, that my arguments are futile; logic becomes</div>
<div id="ty_97" class="t s2_97">meaningless. Neither Kumaril was defeated nor Shankara won – logic was defeated. Because this</div>
<div id="tz_97" class="t s2_97">defeat of logic came through the medium of Shankara, Kumaril bowed and fell down at his feet.</div>
<div id="t10_97" class="t s2_97">And these debates were full of sweetness, these debates were full of love, there was no bitterness in</div>
<div id="t11_97" class="t s2_97">them. They were not ﬁghting like enemies, it was like playing chess: an army of arguments was put</div>
<div id="t12_97" class="t s2_97">at stake. Kumaril prepared the best of his logic and the best of his intellect, and Shankara went on</div>
<div id="t13_97" class="t s2_97">destroying all his arguments one by one. He did not try to put his own argument in Kumaril’s mind,</div>
<div id="t14_97" class="t s2_97">he just went on negating Kumaril’s arguments until a space was left, and in that space discipleship</div>
<div id="t15_97" class="t s2_97">was born. The opponent saw that the person standing in front of him has not brought any theory</div>
<div id="t16_97" class="t s2_97">but truth. He has destroyed all my arguments but has not established any new argument in their</div>
<div id="t17_97" class="t s2_97">place. Empty space was left. There was an interval, there was emptiness, there was a void. In</div>
<div id="t18_97" class="t s2_97">that state meditation happened. In this moment of meditation he bowed down. Do not think that</div>
<div id="t19_97" class="t s2_97">he bowed down before Shankara; he bowed down before the truth which was expressed through</div>
<div id="t1a_97" class="t s2_97">Shankara. Shankara was only an image, a symbol. Kumaril was bowing down before truth. Kumaril</div>
<div id="t1b_97" class="t s2_97">was bowing down not because he was defeated but because he was awakened.</div>
<div id="t1c_97" class="t s2_97">But those people who were standing behind, all they saw was that he was defeated and was bowing</div>
<div id="t1d_97" class="t s2_97">The Great Transcendence</div>
<div id="t1e_97" class="t s2_97">97</div>
<div id="t1f_97" class="t s3_97">Osho</div>
