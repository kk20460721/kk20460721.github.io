<div id="t3_111" class="t s1_111">Somebody asked Buddha, "When you die will you go to heaven?" </div>
<div id="t4_111" class="t s1_111">Buddha said, "Don't ask nonsense questions. Wherever a buddha is there is heaven. </div>

<div id="t6_111" class="t s1_111">This is much closer to the truth, far more beautiful; the very statement is significant. </div>

<div id="te_111" class="t s1_111">moral lives will go to heaven." </div>
<div id="tf_111" class="t s1_111">A man stood up and asked, "A question has arisen in me. The question is: Those who </div>

<div id="ti_111" class="t s1_111">The priest was at a loss; he had not thought about it. The question was tricky. He said, </div>

<div id="tk_111" class="t s1_111">Those seven days were real hell for him. He tried to figure it out, but it was impossible </div>

<div id="tr_111" class="t s1_111">he was thinking and consulting books, but there was no answer coming. </div>
<div id="ts_111" class="t s1_111">Sunday came; he came a little early to the church to pray to Jesus. "Help me!" he prayed </div>
<div id="tt_111" class="t s1_111">to Jesus. The whole night he had not slept so while he was praying he fell asleep, and he </div>
<div id="tu_111" class="t s1_111">dreamed a beautiful dream, a very significant dream. He saw that he was in a train. He </div>

<div id="tx_111" class="t s1_111">He said, "This is very good! That's what I wanted to see -- see with my own eyes. </div>
