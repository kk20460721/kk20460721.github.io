<div id="t2_85" class="t s1_85">caught. The beggar starts becoming restless. This was not asked for. </div>
<div id="t3_85" class="t s1_85">If Jesus was a little diplomatic, he would have given a philosophical answer. </div>
<div id="t4_85" class="t s1_85">Pilate was a student of philosophy; he would have understood. Jesus could have </div>
<div id="t5_85" class="t s1_85">convinced him, argued, persuaded. Pilate may have saved Jesus his life. But </div>
<div id="t6_85" class="t s1_85">rather than saying anything he created a climate, a situation in which Pilate </div>
<div id="t7_85" class="t s1_85">became very restless. </div>
<div id="t8_85" class="t s1_85">Just think: Jesus is looking in you. Silence becomes embarrassing. This man </div>
<div id="t9_85" class="t s1_85">seems to be dangerous, as if he is pushing a dagger in your heart. Suddenly </div>
<div id="ta_85" class="t s1_85">Pilate must have felt the emptiness, the poverty that he was. He turned aside. He </div>
<div id="tb_85" class="t s1_85">said to the priest, "Take this man away and do whatsoever you like." But he must </div>
<div id="tc_85" class="t s1_85">not have slept that night, or even for months. Jesus must have haunted him. </div>
<div id="td_85" class="t s1_85">A very nondiplomatic answer. Jesus should have said the same thing that Pilate </div>
<div id="te_85" class="t s1_85">believed. That would have been diplomacy. Politicians say only the things you </div>
<div id="tf_85" class="t s1_85">already believe. Then you are with them. They don't disturb, they console. Their </div>
<div id="tg_85" class="t s1_85">answers are like ointments. </div>
<div id="th_85" class="t s1_85">Jesus' answer to the question, "What is truth?" -- his answer is like a wound in the </div>

<div id="tj_85" class="t s1_85">this man mean? Why did he remain silent, why did he look so deeply within me? </div>
<div id="tk_85" class="t s1_85">Why?" In his dreams it must have become a nightmare. </div>
<div id="tl_85" class="t s1_85">Jesus was not a politician, not even of love. Love cannot be politics. </div>
<div id="tm_85" class="t s1_85">Love is simple, not complex. Politics is very complex and cunning. Love is </div>
<div id="tn_85" class="t s1_85">intelligence; politics is stupidity. Only mediocre people get interested in politics. </div>
<div id="to_85" class="t s1_85">Love is tremendous intelligence; it is understanding. When you love, you are </div>

<div id="ts_85" class="t s1_85">between two souls, there is no other way. Just like a river flows between two </div>
<div id="tt_85" class="t s1_85">banks. Love flows between two souls. Love is individual, intimate, close. </div>
<div id="tu_85" class="t s1_85">It can flow between one individual and the whole existence, because the whole </div>
<div id="tv_85" class="t s1_85">existence has a soul. That soul is God. But it cannot flow between one individual </div>
