<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">CHAPTER 6. EVERY CHILD’S ORIGINAL FACE IS THE FACE OF GOD</div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s2_91">as Doctor Sunderlal, D.Litt. Nobody suspects, nobody even enquires who gave him a doctorate,</div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s2_91">from what university? But the whole town knows him. And because he is an honorary doctorate he</div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s2_91">inaugurates social gatherings in the school, in the college – now the town has a college – and he is</div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s2_91">the most literary ﬁgure.</div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s2_91">Just now my mother was saying that Doctor Sunderlal has become a member of parliament. The</div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s2_91">new government ... after Indira’s assassination, Rajiv Gandhi chose him. He is rich and certainly</div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s2_91">respected in the town because he is the only doctor – an honorary doctor!</div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s2_91">People get ...</div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s2_91">and</div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s2_91">perhaps he believes it. Now you cannot tell him that he is not. He will drag you to the court.</div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s2_91">Now, for almost thirty years he has been a doctor; that is enough. Nobody has objected, nobody</div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s2_91">has raised a question. In his election campaign his name was Doctor Sunderlal, D.Litt. – ”Vote for</div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s2_91">Doctor Sunderlal, D.Litt.” Perhaps – and he is a little nuts – he believes that he is. I know that even I</div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s2_91">cannot persuade him that ”this doctorate I gave to you.” He will laugh and say, ”What are you saying?</div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s2_91">I have been a doctor for thirty years. You were just a little kid when I became a doctor!”</div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s2_91">He will not agree so easily to drop his doctorate. But even if you get a doctorate from a university,</div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s2_91">what does it mean? There is not much difference.</div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s2_91">I know one very famous Indian politician, Doctor Govindadas. Maitreya knows him because they</div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s2_91">both were in parliament together. Doctor Govindadas was in the parliament perhaps the longest time</div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s2_91">in the whole history of humanity: from 1914 till he died, I think in 1978, he remained continuously,</div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s2_91">without a single gap, a member of parliament. He was the richest man in the whole state of Madhya</div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s2_91">Pradesh.</div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s2_91">His father was given the title of raja, king; although he was not a king, he had so much land, and so</div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s2_91">many properties – one third of the houses of the whole city of Jabalpur, which is ten times bigger than</div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s2_91">Portland, belonged to him. He had so much land that the British government thought it perfectly right</div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s2_91">to give him the title. And he was helping the British government, so he was called Raja Gokuldas,</div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s2_91">and his house was not called a house, it was called Gokuldas Palace.</div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s2_91">Govindadas was Gokuldas’ eldest son – a very mediocre mind. It hurts me to say so but what can</div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s2_91">I do? If he was mediocre it is not my fault. He was very kind and friendly to me and very respectful</div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s2_91">too. He was very old but he used to come every day whenever he was in Jabalpur. Whenever the</div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s2_91">parliament was not in session he was in Jabalpur; otherwise he was in New Delhi. Whenever he</div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s2_91">was in Jabalpur, in the morning from eight to eleven, his limousine was standing in front of my door,</div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s2_91">every day religiously.</div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s2_91">Anybody wanting to meet him between eight and eleven need not go anywhere; he had just to</div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s2_91">stand outside my gate. What was happening in those three hours? He used to come there with his</div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s2_91">secretary, his steno. He would ask me a question, I would answer, and the steno would write it in</div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s2_91">shorthand. Then he published in his own name everything that I said.</div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s2_91">Govindadas has published books, two books; not a single word is his. Yes, there are a few words</div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s2_91">from the secretary. I was puzzled when I saw those books – and he presented them to me. I looked</div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s2_91">inside ... I knew that this was going to happen, it was happening every day – in newspapers he was</div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s2_91">publishing my answers all over India.</div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s2_91">From Darkness to Light</div>
<div id="t18_91" class="t s2_91">91</div>
<div id="t19_91" class="t s3_91">Osho</div>
