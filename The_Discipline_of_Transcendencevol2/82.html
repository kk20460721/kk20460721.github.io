<div id="t2_82" class="t s1_82">disappear in prayer. The self can disappear in dance, in singing and painting. </div>
<div id="t3_82" class="t s1_82">The self can disappear anywhere if you are completely lost in any activity, and </div>
<div id="t4_82" class="t s1_82">the activity is so deep that you are no more a doer there; you have become one </div>
<div id="t5_82" class="t s1_82">with it. It happens sometimes. </div>
<div id="t6_82" class="t s1_82">Once a young man came to me. He was a good runner, a champion runner, and </div>
<div id="t7_82" class="t s1_82">he asked me how to meditate, and he was so bubbling with energy. He was a </div>
<div id="t8_82" class="t s1_82">great runner, and he said, 'When I sit, and you tell me to sit silently, I cannot sit; </div>
<div id="t9_82" class="t s1_82">the energy is so much. Is there any possibility for me to ever become meditative?' </div>
<div id="ta_82" class="t s1_82">I said, 'You forget about meditation. You run, and you drop yourself in running. </div>
<div id="tb_82" class="t s1_82">One day meditation will happen.' </div>
<div id="tc_82" class="t s1_82">He said, 'What are you saying? Just by running? Has anybody ever become a </div>
<div id="td_82" class="t s1_82">Buddha just running?' </div>
<div id="te_82" class="t s1_82">I said, 'Yes, there is a possibility. Because a person can become a Buddha in any </div>
<div id="tf_82" class="t s1_82">activity.' </div>
<div id="tg_82" class="t s1_82">He said, 'I will try.' </div>
<div id="th_82" class="t s1_82">After a week he came and he said, 'It is unbelievable. I cannot even believe that it </div>
<div id="ti_82" class="t s1_82">has happened. Something tremendously beautiful happened. I was running, I </div>
<div id="tj_82" class="t s1_82">was going as fast as I could. And as you had said, I forgot myself completely. I </div>
<div id="tk_82" class="t s1_82">was not performing, it was not a competition. I was simply in it... the sun falling </div>
<div id="tl_82" class="t s1_82">on my being, showering me, the morning breeze, the birds singing, and the </div>
<div id="tm_82" class="t s1_82">empty bank of the river. And I was running and running. </div>
<div id="tn_82" class="t s1_82">'And by and by I started falling into a rhythm with the river, with the breeze, </div>
<div id="to_82" class="t s1_82">with the trees. And suddenly, yes, it was there. I was so full of joy. I have never </div>
<div id="tp_82" class="t s1_82">been so joyful. Tell me, Osho, has it really happened? Because I cannot believe </div>
<div id="tq_82" class="t s1_82">that just by running... and I have been running for many years and it has never </div>
<div id="tr_82" class="t s1_82">happened.' He was not losing himself; running was a performance. </div>
<div id="ts_82" class="t s1_82">Now, one of the most miserable things is happening in the West -- people are </div>
<div id="tt_82" class="t s1_82">making even love a performance. They read Masters and Johnson, and they read </div>
<div id="tu_82" class="t s1_82">Kinsey and his reports, and they read other so-called great sex researchers, and </div>
<div id="tv_82" class="t s1_82">now they are trying to perform. </div>
<div id="tw_82" class="t s1_82">They go on looking whether the woman is having the orgasm or not, whether </div>
<div id="tx_82" class="t s1_82">she is thinking that the man is the greatest man in the world or not. And the </div>
<div id="ty_82" class="t s1_82">woman is also thinking in the same way -- seeing whether she is fulfilling the </div>
<div id="tz_82" class="t s1_82">man and giving him great ecstasy or not. Now both are performing and the </div>
<div id="t10_82" class="t s1_82">whole thing is destroyed. Now they are simply acting, they are no more in it. </div>
<div id="t11_82" class="t s1_82">In the West, this century is proving the worst century for love. And they talk too </div>
<div id="t12_82" class="t s1_82">much about love, and so many books are there -- but something is missing. Love </div>
<div id="t13_82" class="t s1_82">is becoming a performance. </div>
<div id="t14_82" class="t s1_82">I am saying to you that even a thing like running, if it is no more a performance, </div>
<div id="t15_82" class="t s1_82">will give you the same orgasm that love can give, and the same ecstasy that </div>
<div id="t16_82" class="t s1_82">meditation can give. Even cleansing the floor, you can attain to samadhi. </div>
