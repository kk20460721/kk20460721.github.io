<div id="t1_35" class="t s1_35">standing at the back -- they were following him everywhere. It was impossible </div>
<div id="t2_35" class="t s1_35">for him to sleep, it was impossible to be alone, because they were torturing him. </div>
<div id="t3_35" class="t s1_35">Now what to do? </div>
<div id="t4_35" class="t s1_35">Everybody had been saying to him that this was imagination. The doctor had </div>
<div id="t5_35" class="t s1_35">said to him that this was imagination, the psychiatrist had said that nothing </div>
<div id="t6_35" class="t s1_35">could be done, he was simply imagining, he had no real problem. But whether he </div>
<div id="t7_35" class="t s1_35">had a real problem or not, you cannot deny his problem. He had a problem -- </div>
<div id="t8_35" class="t s1_35">real, unreal, is immaterial. For him it was real. He was suffering; his suffering </div>
<div id="t9_35" class="t s1_35">was real. </div>
<div id="ta_35" class="t s1_35">When he came to me, I looked to his right and I said, 'Perfectly right, the man is </div>
<div id="tb_35" class="t s1_35">there!' He smiled at me; I was the first man who understood him. And I said, 'By </div>
<div id="tc_35" class="t s1_35">your left side also I can see people, and they are following you. How do you </div>
<div id="td_35" class="t s1_35">survive with so many ghosts?' </div>
<div id="te_35" class="t s1_35">He said, 'Nobody listens to me' -- but he relaxed. He touched my feet. He said, </div>
<div id="tf_35" class="t s1_35">'You are the only person, otherwise I go on proving and nobody listens. They </div>
<div id="tg_35" class="t s1_35">say, "It is all imagination. You are in a sort of delusion. Drop imagination. There </div>
<div id="th_35" class="t s1_35">are nothing like ghosts."' </div>
<div id="ti_35" class="t s1_35">But I said, 'I can see. Who are these people?' His father was with him, his wife </div>
<div id="tj_35" class="t s1_35">was with him, and they became afraid when I said, 'Yes, they are there.' And he </div>
<div id="tk_35" class="t s1_35">said to his father, 'Now, listen to what Osho is saying. And you were thinking I </div>
<div id="tl_35" class="t s1_35">am a fool.' Now he gained his confidence. </div>
<div id="tm_35" class="t s1_35">What I was saying was a lie; there were no ghosts -- but that is not the point. The </div>
<div id="tn_35" class="t s1_35">man was suffering from lack of confidence, the man was suffering from fear. </div>
<div id="to_35" class="t s1_35">Now, just by accepting his lie... I am also a liar, I am saying, 'Yes, they are there'... </div>
<div id="tp_35" class="t s1_35">I helped him to regain his confidence. He looked better, he looked stronger. </div>
<div id="tq_35" class="t s1_35">Maybe the ghosts are there, but he is not wrong. Maybe the ghosts are still there, </div>
<div id="tr_35" class="t s1_35">but he is not a fool, not an idiot. And I told him, 'Nothing to be worried about. </div>
<div id="ts_35" class="t s1_35">There are methods; we will deal with them.' </div>
<div id="tt_35" class="t s1_35">He said, 'That's what I am asking people. Help me! Give me something to deal </div>
<div id="tu_35" class="t s1_35">with them.' </div>
<div id="tv_35" class="t s1_35">'Don't be worried. And as I can see, they are not stronger than you.' Immediately </div>
<div id="tw_35" class="t s1_35">his height was greater than before. He took a deep inhalation, his spine became </div>
<div id="tx_35" class="t s1_35">erect. And I gave him just an ordinary locket, nothing in it, empty, and I told </div>
<div id="ty_35" class="t s1_35">him, 'You just keep it with you. And whenever you feel they are there, you just </div>
<div id="tz_35" class="t s1_35">hold it in your hand, and they will start becoming afraid; they will be frightened </div>
<div id="t10_35" class="t s1_35">and they will start rushing. Don't be worried, just hold it in your hand.' </div>
<div id="t11_35" class="t s1_35">He tried and he laughed. He said, 'They are doing that. They are running away </div>
<div id="t12_35" class="t s1_35">from me. Now I'm not afraid.' </div>
<div id="t13_35" class="t s1_35">Just two weeks time and he was a normal man. When he was normal and the </div>
<div id="t14_35" class="t s1_35">ghosts had disappeared and he had regained his normality, I told him, 'Now, </div>
<div id="t15_35" class="t s1_35">give me that locket, because it has nothing in it.' </div>
<div id="t16_35" class="t s1_35">He said, 'What do you mean?' </div>
