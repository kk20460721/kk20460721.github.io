<div id="t2_138" class="t s1_138">Then the journalist became a little confused -- this man cannot manage! If yesterday was </div>
<div id="t3_138" class="t s1_138">Friday, then there is no point in asking, "What day is today?" </div>
<div id="t4_138" class="t s1_138">The woman said, "Of course today is Saturday." </div>
<div id="t5_138" class="t s1_138">And he shouted at the woman, he said, "How it can be? If yesterday was Friday, how it </div>
<div id="t6_138" class="t s1_138">can be Saturday today? Impossible! You go and find out what day today is." </div>
<div id="t7_138" class="t s1_138">The journalist escaped, thinking that this is something insane, this man is insane; he </div>
<div id="t8_138" class="t s1_138">never even looked back. When he had gone, Gurdjieff had a good, hearty laugh. He said </div>
<div id="t9_138" class="t s1_138">to the woman, "You see how I got rid of that man. Now he will never come back and he </div>
<div id="ta_138" class="t s1_138">will spread the story around and many more will be prevented from coming." </div>
<div id="tb_138" class="t s1_138">One never knows how an enlightened person is going to behave -- with what devices. </div>
<div id="tc_138" class="t s1_138">Deepesh, your feeling that you love these words, this beautiful passage, is good, but </div>
<div id="td_138" class="t s1_138">remember that man is worth both weeping and laughing over. Yes, he is in great misery </div>
<div id="te_138" class="t s1_138">but the misery is created by himself. He IS trapped and he suffers much, but the trap is </div>
<div id="tf_138" class="t s1_138">made by himself. He is like a small child who was playing outside the house with a pile </div>
<div id="tg_138" class="t s1_138">of bricks. He started making a house of bricks, standing in the middle he went on </div>
<div id="th_138" class="t s1_138">putting brick upon brick around himself. When they came up to his neck then he </div>
<div id="ti_138" class="t s1_138">became puzzled, then he started shouting to his mother, that "I am imprisoned, come </div>
<div id="tj_138" class="t s1_138">and save me!" Now he cannot get out of it -- but he himself has created it! </div>
<div id="tk_138" class="t s1_138">This is the situation of man, we create our misery, our hell. If you see that we go on </div>
<div id="tl_138" class="t s1_138">creating it, it is worth laughing at; but if you say, and see, that "Maybe we create it but </div>
<div id="tm_138" class="t s1_138">still we are suffering," then it is worth weeping over. </div>
<div id="tn_138" class="t s1_138">But Buddha will not do either. He will remain detached, cool. He will not suffer because </div>
<div id="to_138" class="t s1_138">you are suffering and he will not even think your misery worth laughing about. He will </div>
<div id="tp_138" class="t s1_138">keep his cool; he will do whatsoever he can to help you and will go on his way. </div>
<div id="tq_138" class="t s1_138">Whether you are helped or not is not his business. His business is to say what is, and </div>
<div id="tr_138" class="t s1_138">even THAT he had agreed to very reluctantly. </div>
<div id="ts_138" class="t s1_138">When he became enlightened he remained silent for seven days. The story is, the gods </div>
<div id="tt_138" class="t s1_138">became very much worried because it rarely happens that a man becomes enlightened. </div>
<div id="tu_138" class="t s1_138">Now this Siddhartha had become enlightened and he has not spoken a single word for </div>
<div id="tv_138" class="t s1_138">seven days. They looked deep into the consciousness of Siddhartha and they saw that </div>
<div id="tw_138" class="t s1_138">he was not going to speak at all. </div>
<div id="tx_138" class="t s1_138">They came down to the earth, bowed down to Buddha and asked him to speak because </div>
<div id="ty_138" class="t s1_138">there were many who could be helped. Buddha said to them, "I had thought about it </div>
<div id="tz_138" class="t s1_138">but there are only two alternatives. One is: I will speak but I will be understood only by </div>
<div id="t10_138" class="t s1_138">very few people. The majority will not understand, maybe ninety-nine percent of the </div>
<div id="t11_138" class="t s1_138">people will not understand at all. So ninety-nine percent of my efforts is going to be a </div>
<div id="t12_138" class="t s1_138">sheer wastage. </div>
