<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">just on the threshold of wisdom. Because he knows he knows not, he can inquire, and </div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">his inquiry will be pure, unprejudiced. He will inquire without any conclusions. He will </div>

<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">at all. </div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">Socrates was trying to do the same thing in Athens: he was trying to make these learned </div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">fools aware that all their learning was false, that they were really fools, pretenders, </div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">hypocrites. Naturally, all the professors and all the philosophers and all the so-called </div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s1_103">thinkers...and Athens was full of them. Athens was the capital of knowledge in those </div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">days. Just as today people look towards Oxford or Cambridge, people used to look </div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s1_103">towards Athens. It was full of the learned fools, and Socrates was trying to bring them </div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s1_103">down to the earth, was shattering their knowledge, was raising such questions -- simple </div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s1_103">in a way, but difficult to be answered by those who have only acquired knowledge from </div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s1_103">others. </div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s1_103">Athens became very angry with Socrates. They poisoned this man. Socrates is one of the </div>

<div id="tq_103" class="t s1_103">done. His method is a basic method. The Socratic method of inquiry is such that it </div>

<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">too uncomfortable for them. Its basic attack was on the brahmins, the learned fools, and </div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">naturally they were offended. They could not face Buddha, they could not encounter </div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">him. They waited for their opportunity in a cunning way: when Buddha died, then they </div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">started fighting the followers. When the light was gone, then it was the time for the </div>

<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">because of these fools...and because they are powerful they can harm, and because they </div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">are powerful they can destroy any possibility, any opportunity for man to evolve. Man </div>
