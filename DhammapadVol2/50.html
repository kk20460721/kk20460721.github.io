<div id="t1_50" class="t s1_50">To be rich is in a way very dangerous: it can drive you towards suicide, it can drive you </div>
<div id="t2_50" class="t s1_50">towards some kind of madness -- but it is also very significant because it can drive you </div>
<div id="t3_50" class="t s1_50">towards religion, towards your inwardness, interiority, it can become an inward </div>
<div id="t4_50" class="t s1_50">revolution. It depends on you -- alternatives are open. A rich person either has to </div>
<div id="t5_50" class="t s1_50">become neurotic, suicidal, or he has to become a meditator; there is no third alternative </div>
<div id="t6_50" class="t s1_50">available for him. </div>
<div id="t7_50" class="t s1_50">The poor man cannot be suicidal, cannot be neurotic; he has not even enough bread, </div>
<div id="t8_50" class="t s1_50">what to say of the mind? He is so tired by the evening, he cannot think, no energy to </div>
<div id="t9_50" class="t s1_50">think...falls asleep. In the morning again the old rut of earning bread. Every day he has </div>
<div id="ta_50" class="t s1_50">to earn, somehow to remain alive, to survive. He cannot afford the luxuries of neuroses, </div>
<div id="tb_50" class="t s1_50">he cannot afford the luxuries of psychoanalysis -- these are luxuries only rich people can </div>
<div id="tc_50" class="t s1_50">afford! And he cannot be really a meditator either. He will go to the temple, but he will </div>
<div id="td_50" class="t s1_50">ask for something worldly. His wife is ill, his children are not getting admission into </div>
<div id="te_50" class="t s1_50">school, he is unemployed. He goes to the temple to ask these things. The quality of the </div>
<div id="tf_50" class="t s1_50">religion of the poor is very poor. </div>
<div id="tg_50" class="t s1_50">There are two kinds of religiousness in the world: the religiousness of the poor -- it is </div>
<div id="th_50" class="t s1_50">very worldly, it is very materialistic -- and the religiousness of the rich -- it is very </div>
<div id="ti_50" class="t s1_50">spiritual, very nonmaterialistic. When a rich man prays, his prayer cannot be for money. </div>
<div id="tj_50" class="t s1_50">If he is still praying for money, he is not yet rich enough. </div>
<div id="tk_50" class="t s1_50">There was a Sufi saint, Farid. Once the villagers asked him, "Farid, the great king, </div>
<div id="tl_50" class="t s1_50">Akbar, comes to you so many times -- why don't you ask him to open a school for poor </div>
<div id="tm_50" class="t s1_50">people in our village? We don't have a school." </div>
<div id="tn_50" class="t s1_50">Farid said, "Good, so why should I wait for him to come? I will go." </div>
<div id="to_50" class="t s1_50">He went to Delhi, he was received -- everybody knew that Akbar respected him </div>
<div id="tp_50" class="t s1_50">tremendously. Akbar was praying in his private mosque; Farid was allowed in. He </div>
<div id="tq_50" class="t s1_50">went in, he saw Akbar praying. He was standing behind Akbar -- he could hear what he </div>
<div id="tr_50" class="t s1_50">was saying. With hands spread, Akbar was just finishing his prayer, his NAMAZ, and </div>
<div id="ts_50" class="t s1_50">he was saying to God, "Almighty Compassionate One, shower more riches on me! Give </div>
<div id="tt_50" class="t s1_50">me a greater kingdom!" </div>
<div id="tu_50" class="t s1_50">Farid immediately turned away. It was just the end of the prayer, so Akbar became </div>
<div id="tv_50" class="t s1_50">aware that somebody had been and had gone away. He looked back, saw Farid going </div>
<div id="tw_50" class="t s1_50">down the steps, ran, touched the feet of Farid and asked, "Why have you come?" -- </div>
<div id="tx_50" class="t s1_50">because for the first time he had come -- "and why are you going away?" </div>
<div id="ty_50" class="t s1_50">Farid said, "I had come with the idea that you are rich, but listening to your prayer I </div>
<div id="tz_50" class="t s1_50">realized that you are still poor. And if you are still asking for money, for more power, </div>
<div id="t10_50" class="t s1_50">then it is not good for me to ask for money, because I had come to ask for a little money </div>
<div id="t11_50" class="t s1_50">to open a school in my village. No, I cannot ask from a poor man. You yourself need </div>
<div id="t12_50" class="t s1_50">more. I will collect some from the village and give it to you! And as far as the school is </div>
<div id="t13_50" class="t s1_50">concerned, if you are asking from God, I can ask from God directly -- why should I use </div>
<div id="t14_50" class="t s1_50">you as a mediator?" </div>
<div id="t15_50" class="t s1_50">The story is reported by Akbar himself in his autobiography. He says, "For the first time </div>
<div id="t16_50" class="t s1_50">I became aware that, yes, I am not yet rich enough, I am not yet dissatisfied with all this </div>
