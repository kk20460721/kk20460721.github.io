<div id="t1_180" class="t s1_180">With much difficulty he found the apartment building, but he had no idea which </div>
<div id="t2_180" class="t s1_180">apartment he had been in. The only thing he remembered about it was a magnificent </div>
<div id="t3_180" class="t s1_180">gold toilet. </div>
<div id="t4_180" class="t s1_180">So he knocked at the first apartment. The door was opened by a man with a hangover. </div>
<div id="t5_180" class="t s1_180">"Hello," said George. "Did you have a party here last night?" </div>
<div id="t6_180" class="t s1_180">"We sure did!" groaned the man. </div>
<div id="t7_180" class="t s1_180">"And do you have a gold toilet?" </div>
<div id="t8_180" class="t s1_180">"A gold toilet? No, we sure don't." </div>
<div id="t9_180" class="t s1_180">So George had to go to the next door, and so on for three floors. Everyone was </div>
<div id="ta_180" class="t s1_180">recovering from a party, but no one knew anything about a gold toilet. By the time he </div>
<div id="tb_180" class="t s1_180">got to the last apartment, George was beginning to think he had imagined the gold </div>
<div id="tc_180" class="t s1_180">toilet. The door was opened by a man with a hangover. </div>
<div id="td_180" class="t s1_180">"Uh, hello," said George. "Did you have a party here last night?" </div>
<div id="te_180" class="t s1_180">"We sure had a party here!" groaned the man. </div>
<div id="tf_180" class="t s1_180">"And do you by any chance have a gold toilet?" </div>
<div id="tg_180" class="t s1_180">There was a long silence. </div>
<div id="th_180" class="t s1_180">Finally the man shouted back over his shoulder, "Hey, Harry -- here is the guy who shit </div>
<div id="ti_180" class="t s1_180">in your tuba!" </div>
<div id="tj_180" class="t s1_180">So, Shraddan, the allowance can be allowed... but what about other people's tubas? You </div>
<div id="tk_180" class="t s1_180">will create trouble. If you listen to my advice, forget the whole idea. It is good that you </div>
<div id="tl_180" class="t s1_180">are broke. This is called a blessing in disguise. If you were not broke you would have </div>
<div id="tm_180" class="t s1_180">gone a la Gurdjieff, and that would have led you into more trouble. </div>
<div id="tn_180" class="t s1_180">Gurdjieff certainly forced people to drink, but only the people who were against </div>
<div id="to_180" class="t s1_180">alcohol. He used to make toasts every night for all the kinds of idiots in the world. He </div>
<div id="tp_180" class="t s1_180">had twenty-six categories of idiots. I don't know to which category you would belong, </div>
<div id="tq_180" class="t s1_180">but you must belong to some category. Unless you are awakened you are bound to </div>
<div id="tr_180" class="t s1_180">belong to some category or other. </div>
<div id="ts_180" class="t s1_180">An idiot is a person who is trying to find joy where joy does not exist at all, who is </div>
<div id="tt_180" class="t s1_180">trying to search for something which he has never lost in the first place. The </div>
<div id="tu_180" class="t s1_180">enlightened person is one who has looked into his being before searching for anything </div>
<div id="tv_180" class="t s1_180">anywhere else. It is better to look in your own house. He has looked in and has found it </div>
<div id="tw_180" class="t s1_180">there. Now his search has disappeared. </div>
<div id="tx_180" class="t s1_180">The person who is interested in alcohol must be living in misery, in a kind of suffering. </div>
<div id="ty_180" class="t s1_180">That's why he wants somehow to forget it all. Alcohol is nothing but a chemical strategy </div>
<div id="tz_180" class="t s1_180">to forget your miseries, anxieties, your problems, to forget yourself. </div>
<div id="t10_180" class="t s1_180">My whole effort here, Shraddan, is to help you to remember yourself -- and you want to </div>
<div id="t11_180" class="t s1_180">forget yourself. By forgetting yourself you will be creating more and more hell for </div>
<div id="t12_180" class="t s1_180">yourself and for others. Remember, rather, remember yourself. </div>
<div id="t13_180" class="t s1_180">My methods are different from George Gurdjieff's. I am not in favor of any alcoholic </div>
<div id="t14_180" class="t s1_180">beverages. I am not in favor of any psychedelic drugs either, because they all create </div>
<div id="t15_180" class="t s1_180">illusory worlds for you and they all are distractions. They make you more and more </div>
<div id="t16_180" class="t s1_180">oblivious of your own being, unaware of your own self. </div>
