<div id="t1_32" class="t s1_32">He has no condemnation of the bad. He says, "Judge ye not! " Moses is a great </div>
<div id="t2_32" class="t s1_32">judge, and Jesus says, "Judge ye not, so that ye may not be judged." Moses says, </div>
<div id="t3_32" class="t s1_32">"Don't do evil," and Jesus says, "Resist not the evil" -- very confusing. He must </div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s1_32">have created great chaos. Wherever he moved he must have brought confusion </div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s1_32">and conflict to people's minds, he must have created anxiety. That's why they </div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s1_32">took revenge and killed him; it is absolutely logical. </div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s1_32">Buddha was not killed in India, Mahavir was not killed -- sometimes a few </div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s1_32">stones were thrown or things like that, but they were not killed, crucified. They </div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s1_32">never confused the mind so much as Jesus. They had something of the Moses in </div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s1_32">them, and Jesus has nothing of the Moses in him. Mahavir has much of the </div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s1_32">Moses in him. He has something of the law and something of love, both. </div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s1_32">Jesus is pure love. That's why he was crucified. He had to be crucified -- such </div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s1_32">pure love cannot be tolerated, such pure grace is impossible to bear; the very </div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s1_32">presence is intolerable because it hurts. The very presence of Jesus throws you in </div>
<div id="tf_32" class="t s1_32">confusion, and the only way to protect yourself and defend yourself is to kill this </div>
<div id="tg_32" class="t s1_32">man, destroy this man. </div>
<div id="th_32" class="t s1_32">By destroying Jesus the people tried to live with Moses and law alone, and not be </div>
<div id="ti_32" class="t s1_32">bothered by love. The day Jesus was crucified, it was nothing but an indication </div>
<div id="tj_32" class="t s1_32">that the ordinary mind would like to live without love. Love was crucified, not </div>
<div id="tk_32" class="t s1_32">Jesus. He is just symbolic. </div>
<div id="tl_32" class="t s1_32">There are many complications. Jews have always been puzzled about why this </div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s1_32">man Jesus influenced the whole world so much and he could not influence the </div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s1_32">Jews at all. Jews are great scholars, their rabbis are great pundits, and they have </div>
<div id="to_32" class="t s1_32">been trying to prove that Jesus did not say a single new word, that all that he </div>
<div id="tp_32" class="t s1_32">said is written in Jewish scriptures. Then why has this man become the very axis </div>
<div id="tq_32" class="t s1_32">of humanity? What happened? -- it seems unbelievable. </div>
<div id="tr_32" class="t s1_32">They are right in a way: Jesus has not said a single word that cannot be found in </div>
<div id="ts_32" class="t s1_32">the sayings of old rabbis. No, he has not said a single new word. But that is not </div>
<div id="tt_32" class="t s1_32">where he is unique, he is unique in the way he has said it -- not the word, but the </div>
<div id="tu_32" class="t s1_32">way he has asserted it. In the Old Testament you come again and again across </div>
<div id="tv_32" class="t s1_32">the expression: "The Lord hath said</div>
<div id="tw_32" class="t s1_32">....</div>
<div id="tx_32" class="t s1_32">" But that is not characteristic of Jesus. </div>
<div id="ty_32" class="t s1_32">Whenever he says this, he says, "I say unto you..." </div>
<div id="tz_32" class="t s1_32">-- not, "The Lord</div>
<div id="t10_32" class="t s1_32">....</div>
<div id="t11_32" class="t s1_32">" He is the </div>
<div id="t12_32" class="t s1_32">Lord. The Old Testament says: "The Lord says this"; Jesus says, "I say unto you." </div>
<div id="t13_32" class="t s1_32">The old rabbis stammer, Jesus speaks; the old rabbis have a borrowed glory, </div>
<div id="t14_32" class="t s1_32">Jesus has his own. The old rabbis speak FROM authority; Jesus with authority -- </div>
<div id="t15_32" class="t s1_32">and that is a great difference. </div>
<div id="t16_32" class="t s1_32">It is said that once the enemies of Jesus sent a man to catch hold of him and bring </div>
<div id="t17_32" class="t s1_32">him to the temple. He was teaching near the temple and a crowd had gathered. </div>
<div id="t18_32" class="t s1_32">The man went there to catch hold of him, to imprison him, but the crowd was big </div>
<div id="t19_32" class="t s1_32">and he had to enter the crowd to reach the man -- it took time. While he was </div>
<div id="t1a_32" class="t s1_32">penetrating the crowd, he had to hear what this man was saying. Then he </div>
<div id="t1b_32" class="t s1_32">stopped, he forgot that for which he had come. Then it became impossible to </div>
<div id="t1c_32" class="t s1_32">imprison this man. He came back. </div>
