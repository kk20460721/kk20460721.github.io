<div id="t1_34" class="t s1_34">CHAPTER 3. THE WATCHMAN</div>
<div id="t2_34" class="t s2_34">The rabbi is a teacher, the zaddik is a Master. The teacher teaches, but has not gone through the</div>
<div id="t3_34" class="t s2_34">transformation himself. The zaddik is also a teacher but he teaches by his life, by his very being –</div>
<div id="t4_34" class="t s2_34">what we call in India ’satguru’. The enlightened Master is ’zaddik’ in Hassidic terms.</div>
<div id="t5_34" class="t s2_34">So somebody asked Joseph Jacov: ’What is the difference between a rabbi and zaddik?’</div>
<div id="t6_34" class="t s2_34">The Master said: ’The zaddik remembers, and the rabbi knows.’</div>
<div id="t7_34" class="t s2_34">The rabbi knows much but doesn’t remember himself. He is lost in his knowledge. He may be a</div>
<div id="t8_34" class="t s2_34">great scholar, he may be very efﬁcient as far as scriptures are concerned. But a zaddik remembers</div>
<div id="t9_34" class="t s2_34">I He may not know much, or may know – but that is irrelevant. He remembers – he remembers</div>
<div id="ta_34" class="t s2_34">himself. And that remembering is the difference.</div>
<div id="tb_34" class="t s2_34">It was difﬁcult for the inquirer to understand, so he said: ’Please explain it to me in a little more</div>
<div id="tc_34" class="t s2_34">detail.’ The Hassid told him a story.</div>
<div id="td_34" class="t s2_34">He said that once it happened: a prince by his wrong behaviour enraged his father. And the way</div>
<div id="te_34" class="t s2_34">the prince was behaving was so uncourtly, so unkingly, that the father had to banish him out of the</div>
<div id="tf_34" class="t s2_34">kingdom.</div>
<div id="tg_34" class="t s2_34">But the father was thinking that he would repent and that he would ask forgiveness and that he would</div>
<div id="th_34" class="t s2_34">come back. But the prince simply disappeared. He never tried in any way to contact his father. He</div>
<div id="ti_34" class="t s2_34">never showed any desire to come back to the palace. It appeared as if he had been simply waiting</div>
<div id="tj_34" class="t s2_34">– how to escape the kingdom and how to escape the palace and the father.</div>
<div id="tk_34" class="t s2_34">He wandered around the kingdom and found a group of drunkards, gamblers, prostitutes – all sorts</div>
<div id="tl_34" class="t s2_34">of evil-doing was going on. He became part of it. Not only did he become a member – by and by,</div>
<div id="tm_34" class="t s2_34">he became the leader. Of course, he was a prince and he had the charisma of becoming a leader.</div>
<div id="tn_34" class="t s2_34">Many years passed. The father was getting older and older, and he was worried, worried for the</div>
<div id="to_34" class="t s2_34">welfare of his only son. Seeing that death is approaching, he sent one of his most clever ministers</div>
<div id="tp_34" class="t s2_34">to bring the son back.</div>
<div id="tq_34" class="t s2_34">The minister went in a beautiful golden chariot with many servants, almost a regiment following him.</div>
<div id="tr_34" class="t s2_34">A great golden tent was ﬁxed outside the village. He sent a messenger to this prince but he himself</div>
<div id="ts_34" class="t s2_34">didn’t bother to turn up. The minister remained outside the village; it was below him to go inside</div>
<div id="tt_34" class="t s2_34">the village. A poor village, and it was absolutely inconceivable for him to enter the black hole where</div>
<div id="tu_34" class="t s2_34">the prince was living with all those dirty people.</div>
<div id="tv_34" class="t s2_34">The minister tried to contact the prince but the</div>
<div id="tw_34" class="t s2_34">communication was not possible – the distance was vast. He failed and came back.</div>
<div id="tx_34" class="t s2_34">Then another, a more courageous man, was sent. He was courageous and he had understood the</div>
<div id="ty_34" class="t s2_34">failure why the ﬁrst messenger, the ﬁrst minister could not communicate.</div>
<div id="tz_34" class="t s2_34">So he didn’t go there like a minister; he went like a peasant in ordinary clothes, with no servants.</div>
<div id="t10_34" class="t s2_34">He simply went and mixed with the group. He became friendly, but by and by, he himself started</div>
<div id="t11_34" class="t s2_34">to love that freedom.</div>
<div id="t12_34" class="t s2_34">The palace was like a prison; there was no freedom.</div>
<div id="t13_34" class="t s2_34">But here everybody</div>
<div id="t14_34" class="t s2_34">was absolutely free, totally free. Nobody was creating any hindrance for anybody, everybody was</div>
<div id="t15_34" class="t s2_34">allowed to be himself. They were drunkards, but they were beautiful people. They were gamblers,</div>
<div id="t16_34" class="t s2_34">The True Sage</div>
<div id="t17_34" class="t s2_34">34</div>
<div id="t18_34" class="t s3_34">Osho</div>
