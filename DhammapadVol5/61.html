<div id="t1_61" class="t s1_61">On the third day, it was another, larger room, and a beautiful brunette! After almost an </div>
<div id="t2_61" class="t s1_61">hour, he caught her too. </div>
<div id="t3_61" class="t s1_61">Throughout the three days, Nasruddin had kept an account of his weight loss -- twenty-</div>
<div id="t4_61" class="t s1_61">eight pounds to date. </div>
<div id="t5_61" class="t s1_61">On the fourth day, he envisioned perhaps a bevy of beauties. He was directed to the top </div>
<div id="t6_61" class="t s1_61">floor. He climbed the stairs, removed his clothes and waited. There was a click behind </div>
<div id="t7_61" class="t s1_61">him as the door was locked, and out of his left eye he caught sight of a huge gorilla </div>
<div id="t8_61" class="t s1_61">coming his way with a sign around its neck which read, "If I catch you I'm going to </div>
<div id="t9_61" class="t s1_61">make love to you!" </div>
<div id="ta_61" class="t s1_61">Sangito, you need not come from California to Poona! But one thing is certain: people </div>
<div id="tb_61" class="t s1_61">become obsessed with food only when they lose the capacity to love. It is an indication </div>
<div id="tc_61" class="t s1_61">that you have forgotten the language of love. If you are in love you never become </div>
<div id="td_61" class="t s1_61">obsessed with food. Obsession with food is a symptom that you don't know how to </div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s1_61">love. How it happens has to be understood. </div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s1_61">The first acquaintance of the child with the world is the mother's breast. That is his first </div>
<div id="tg_61" class="t s1_61">introduction to the world, his entry into the world -- his first relationship is with the </div>
<div id="th_61" class="t s1_61">breast of the mother. And the breast becomes the symbol for him of two things: food </div>
<div id="ti_61" class="t s1_61">and love. </div>
<div id="tj_61" class="t s1_61">Whenever the mother is loving, the breast is available; and whenever the mother is </div>
<div id="tk_61" class="t s1_61">unloving, the breast is not available. Food and love become associated; a deep </div>
<div id="tl_61" class="t s1_61">conditioned reflex happens. It becomes so unconsciously rooted that you repeat it your </div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s1_61">whole life. If the child knows that the mother loves him he will not drink too much, </div>
<div id="tn_61" class="t s1_61">because he KNOWS, he is secure; whenever he needs the mother her breast will be </div>
<div id="to_61" class="t s1_61">available. </div>
<div id="tp_61" class="t s1_61">If the child is insecure and feels that next time the mother may not be available, he will </div>
<div id="tq_61" class="t s1_61">start drinking too much, eating too much. </div>
<div id="tr_61" class="t s1_61">Now, you can see the point: whenever love is there, there is security and a kind of </div>
<div id="ts_61" class="t s1_61">fulfillment, and the child never becomes obsessed with food. If love is not there, there is </div>
<div id="tt_61" class="t s1_61">insecurity, fear, and a kind of emptiness, and the child stuffs that emptiness with food. </div>
<div id="tu_61" class="t s1_61">In the West, weight is becoming more and more of a problem for the simple reason that </div>
<div id="tv_61" class="t s1_61">mothers are not ready to give their breasts to their children. Of course the breast loses </div>
<div id="tw_61" class="t s1_61">its shape; and the fear that the breasts will lose their shape and make the woman look </div>
<div id="tx_61" class="t s1_61">old has gripped the mind of women in the West so deeply that they are afraid to give </div>
<div id="ty_61" class="t s1_61">their breasts to their children. And they are creating an obsession about food in the </div>
<div id="tz_61" class="t s1_61">child unknowingly, unconsciously. The child will become obsessed with food, he will </div>
<div id="t10_61" class="t s1_61">eat too much. Eating will become his substitute for love. </div>
<div id="t11_61" class="t s1_61">Sangito, you will have to learn love. There is no other way to reduce your weight. All </div>
<div id="t12_61" class="t s1_61">other programs can help you a little bit, but sooner or later you will gain weight again </div>
<div id="t13_61" class="t s1_61">because the basic root cause remains the same. You can diet, you can run, swim, </div>
<div id="t14_61" class="t s1_61">exercise, but how long can you diet? Sooner or later you will be fed up with dieting and </div>
<div id="t15_61" class="t s1_61">your mind will become more and more obsessed with eating. Now you will eat in your </div>
<div id="t16_61" class="t s1_61">fantasy, in your dreams, and your mind will convince you that this is not the right way </div>
