<div id="t1_84" class="t s1_84">So the poor man goes home and returns two days after. He says, "Doc, I feel great. Got </div>
<div id="t2_84" class="t s1_84">anything for the white stripes?" </div>
<div id="t3_84" class="t s1_84">But the problem continues. </div>
<div id="t4_84" class="t s1_84">Once it happened, somebody brought a mad young man to me. The young man had a </div>
<div id="t5_84" class="t s1_84">crazy idea that flies had entered into his body, through his nose or mouth, in his sleep, </div>
<div id="t6_84" class="t s1_84">and that they go on whirling inside. So of course he was in much trouble. He would turn </div>
<div id="t7_84" class="t s1_84">this way and that; he could not even sit rightly because of those whirling dervishes inside; </div>
<div id="t8_84" class="t s1_84">he could not sleep. A continuous agony. What to do with this man? So I told him, "You </div>
<div id="t9_84" class="t s1_84">lie down on the bed, have a good ten minutes' rest, and we will do whatsoever can be </div>
<div id="ta_84" class="t s1_84">done." </div>
<div id="tb_84" class="t s1_84">I covered him with a sheet so he could not see what was happening, and I ran over the </div>
<div id="tc_84" class="t s1_84">whole house to catch a few flies. It was difficult because I had never done that before, but </div>
<div id="td_84" class="t s1_84">my experience of catching people helped. Somehow I could get three flies. I put them in a </div>
<div id="te_84" class="t s1_84">bottle, brought them to the man, made some hocus-pocus passes over him, then told him </div>
<div id="tf_84" class="t s1_84">to open his eyes; and I showed him the bottle. </div>
<div id="tg_84" class="t s1_84">He looked at the bottle. He said, "Yes, you have got some, but only the smaller ones. The </div>
<div id="th_84" class="t s1_84">big ones are still there -- and they are so big." Now it is difficult. From where to get such </div>
<div id="ti_84" class="t s1_84">big flies? He said, "I am very, very grateful to you. At least you got rid of the smaller </div>
<div id="tj_84" class="t s1_84">ones; but the big ones are really very big." </div>
<div id="tk_84" class="t s1_84">People go on. If you help them from one side, they will bring the same problem from </div>
<div id="tl_84" class="t s1_84">another side -- as if there is a certain deep necessity. Try to understand it. To live without </div>
<div id="tm_84" class="t s1_84">a problem is very difficult, almost humanly impossible. Why? Because a problem gives </div>
<div id="tn_84" class="t s1_84">you a distraction. A problem gives you an occupation. A problem gives you a busyness </div>
<div id="to_84" class="t s1_84">without any business. A problem engages you. If there is no problem, you will not be </div>
<div id="tp_84" class="t s1_84">able to cling to the periphery of your being. You will be sucked by the center. </div>
<div id="tq_84" class="t s1_84">And the center of your being is empty. It is just like the hub of a wheel. The whole wheel </div>
<div id="tr_84" class="t s1_84">moves on the empty hub. Your innermost core is empty, nothing, nothingness, shunyam, </div>
<div id="ts_84" class="t s1_84">void, abysslike. You are afraid of that emptiness, so you go on clinging to the rim of the </div>
<div id="tt_84" class="t s1_84">wheel or, at the most, if you are a little daring, then you go on clinging to the spokes; but </div>
<div id="tu_84" class="t s1_84">you never move towards the hub. One starts feeling afraid, shaky. </div>
<div id="tv_84" class="t s1_84">Problems help you. Some problem to solve; how can you go within? People come to me </div>
<div id="tw_84" class="t s1_84">and they say, "We want to go within, but there are problems." They think because of the </div>
<div id="tx_84" class="t s1_84">problems they are not going within. The real case is just the opposite: because they don't </div>
<div id="ty_84" class="t s1_84">want to go within, they are creating problems. </div>
<div id="tz_84" class="t s1_84">Let this understanding become as deep in you as possible: your problems are all bogus. </div>
<div id="t10_84" class="t s1_84">I go on answering yom problems just to be polite. They are all bogus, basically </div>
<div id="t11_84" class="t s1_84">meaningless, but they help you to avoid yourself. They distract you. It seems, how can </div>
<div id="t12_84" class="t s1_84">one go in? There are so many problems first to be solved. But one problem solved, </div>
<div id="t13_84" class="t s1_84">immediately another bubbles up. And if you look, watch, you will see the other problem </div>
<div id="t14_84" class="t s1_84">has the same quality as the first. Try to solve it; a third one comes up, immediately </div>
<div id="t15_84" class="t s1_84">substituted. </div>
<div id="t16_84" class="t s1_84">Let me tell you one anecdote. </div>
