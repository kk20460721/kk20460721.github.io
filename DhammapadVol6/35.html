<div id="t2_35" class="t s1_35">slowly, it will happen, because man has not been behaving with trees in a friendly way; </div>
<div id="t3_35" class="t s1_35">hence they have become very much afraid. </div>
<div id="t4_35" class="t s1_35">But now scientists say that when you come with an axe to cut down a tree, even before </div>
<div id="t5_35" class="t s1_35">you have started cutting it, the tree goes into a shiver, a cold shiver. It goes into a great </div>

<div id="t7_35" class="t s1_35">aware of your intention! Now they have sophisticated instruments just like </div>
<div id="t8_35" class="t s1_35">cardiographs, which can make graphs on paper showing what the tree is feeling. When </div>
<div id="t9_35" class="t s1_35">the tree is feeling joyous, there is a rhythm in the graph; when the tree is feeling afraid, </div>
<div id="ta_35" class="t s1_35">the fear is shown on the graph. When the tree sees the friend coming it rejoices, it </div>

<div id="tf_35" class="t s1_35">also says hello in her tongue, in her own language. Hug a tree, and a day will come </div>
<div id="tg_35" class="t s1_35">soon when you will feel that it was not only you who were hugging the tree -- the tree </div>
<div id="th_35" class="t s1_35">was responding, you were also hugged by the tree, although the tree has no hands. But </div>
<div id="ti_35" class="t s1_35">it has its own way of expressing its joy, its sadness, its anger, its fear. </div>
<div id="tj_35" class="t s1_35">The whole existence is sensitive. That's what I mean when I say that existence is God. </div>
<div id="tk_35" class="t s1_35">Be friendly, Satyam, and don't be worried whether anybody is friendly towards you or </div>

<div id="tt_35" class="t s1_35">thousands of people who are coming to me? They have different reasons. </div>
<div id="tu_35" class="t s1_35">A few are coming to me because I have called them: they may know it, they may not </div>
<div id="tv_35" class="t s1_35">know it. There is more possibility that they will not know it, at least not in the </div>

<div id="tx_35" class="t s1_35">slowly slowly, they will become aware that they have been called forth, just as Jesus </div>

<div id="t13_35" class="t s1_35">the LAST time certainly, because I am not going to come again. I have called them </div>
<div id="t14_35" class="t s1_35">because of certain promises made in the past. </div>
<div id="t15_35" class="t s1_35">But there are many kinds of people. A few have come just accidentally; but even though </div>
