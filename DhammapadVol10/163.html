<div id="t1_163" class="t s1_163">Jesus says to his disciples, "Look at the lilies in the field, how beautiful they are!" And </div>
<div id="t2_163" class="t s1_163">what is their secret? The secret is, they never think of the morrow, they live in the </div>
<div id="t3_163" class="t s1_163">present. The whole existence lives in the present, except man. Hence, except man, there </div>
<div id="t4_163" class="t s1_163">is no anxiety, no anguish. All anxiety, all anguish is man-created; it is our own doing. It </div>
<div id="t5_163" class="t s1_163">simply exists in our own minds. Either we are worried about the past -- which is so </div>
<div id="t6_163" class="t s1_163">stupid because you can't do anything about it; whatsoever has happened has happened, </div>
<div id="t7_163" class="t s1_163">you cannot go back. But we go on thinking, "Had I done this, had I said this</div>
<div id="t8_163" class="t s1_163">....</div>
<div id="t9_163" class="t s1_163">" You are </div>
<div id="ta_163" class="t s1_163">simply wasting more time. People go on repenting about the past -- that which is not is </div>
<div id="tb_163" class="t s1_163">not worth repenting about. People feel guilty about their past. That which is gone is </div>
<div id="tc_163" class="t s1_163">gone forever. Feel disconnected, become discontinuous. </div>
<div id="td_163" class="t s1_163">Each moment, Samarpan, one has to become discontinuous with the past. And if you </div>
<div id="te_163" class="t s1_163">become discontinuous with the past, only then do you stop worrying about the future, </div>
<div id="tf_163" class="t s1_163">because the future is nothing but a projection of the past. The people who live in the </div>
<div id="tg_163" class="t s1_163">past also live in the future. The future is a reflection of the past. What exactly is your </div>
<div id="th_163" class="t s1_163">idea of future? It means you are not going to commit the mistakes that you committed </div>
<div id="ti_163" class="t s1_163">in the past -- delete those mistakes. And you are going to enjoy all that was pleasant in </div>
<div id="tj_163" class="t s1_163">the past more deeply. That's what your future is: intensifying your pleasures of the past </div>
<div id="tk_163" class="t s1_163">and deleting your pains of the past. </div>
<div id="tl_163" class="t s1_163">But you don't understand life. Pains and pleasures are joined together. If you want the </div>
<div id="tm_163" class="t s1_163">same pleasures that you enjoyed in the past and you want them to be more intense, you </div>
<div id="tn_163" class="t s1_163">are asking for the pain that you also suffered in the past. And, of course, the pain will be </div>
<div id="to_163" class="t s1_163">as intense as the pleasure. They are always balanced, they move together, they are </div>
<div id="tp_163" class="t s1_163">inseparable. They are two sides of the same coin. </div>
<div id="tq_163" class="t s1_163">So you are simply wasting time, whether you are thinking of the past or of the future. </div>
<div id="tr_163" class="t s1_163">And the future is not going to be according to YOU. Who are you to decide about the </div>
<div id="ts_163" class="t s1_163">future? This vast universe can't be decided by your private will, by your ego. You have </div>
<div id="tt_163" class="t s1_163">to stop pushing the river. You have to learn how to go with the river, how to go with </div>
<div id="tu_163" class="t s1_163">the wind. </div>
<div id="tv_163" class="t s1_163">Lao Tzu says: Be like a dead leaf, so wherever the wind blows the leaf goes with it. It </div>
<div id="tw_163" class="t s1_163">has no destiny of its own, it has no private goals of its own, it has no will of its own. It is </div>
<div id="tx_163" class="t s1_163">utterly surrendered. That is the meaning of your name, Samarpan. SAMARPAN means </div>
<div id="ty_163" class="t s1_163">"totally surrendered": one who has lost his will into the will of the whole. </div>
<div id="tz_163" class="t s1_163">Jesus says on the cross, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done." That is samarpan, that is </div>
<div id="t10_163" class="t s1_163">surrender. "Thy will, not mine." That is his last prayer and the very essence of prayer, </div>
<div id="t11_163" class="t s1_163">the very soul of a religious man. </div>
<div id="t12_163" class="t s1_163">There is no need to prepare for the future. Live in the present so totally, that's all. That is </div>
<div id="t13_163" class="t s1_163">preparation for the future without preparing at all. Why? -- because when you live </div>
<div id="t14_163" class="t s1_163">totally in the present, the future is going to be born out of the present. From where is it </div>
<div id="t15_163" class="t s1_163">going to come? It is going to grow out of this moment. If you have lived this moment in </div>
<div id="t16_163" class="t s1_163">its total beauty, joy, celebration, the next moment will come out of it and you will be </div>
<div id="t17_163" class="t s1_163">able to live it even more totally, even more joyously. But you don't think about it and </div>
<div id="t18_163" class="t s1_163">you don't prepare for it because thinking and preparing means missing this moment. </div>
