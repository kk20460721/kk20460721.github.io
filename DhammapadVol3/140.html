<div id="t7_140" class="t s1_140">Peace means going beyond the excitement of happiness and unhappiness both. There </div>
<div id="t8_140" class="t s1_140">are people who are attracted to unhappiness too; modern psychology calls them </div>
<div id="t9_140" class="t s1_140">masochists. They enjoy torturing themselves. In the past these same masochists became </div>
