<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">eternal. Don't be worried, you never die. Only the body dies." I know that is true, but that </div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">truth one has to earn the hard way. You cannot learn by somebody else's assertion and </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">statement about it. It is not a statement; it is an experience. I know it is so, but it is </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">absolutely meaningless for you. You have not known what life is. How can you know </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">what eternity is? You have not been able even to live in time. How can you be able to live </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">in eternity? </div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">One becomes aware of the deathless when one has become capable of accepting death. </div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s1_51">Through the door of death, the deathless reveals itself. Death is a way of the deathless to </div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">reveal itself to you... but in fear you close your eyes and you become unconscious. </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">No, I am not going to give you a method, a theory to get rid of it. It is symptomatic. It is </div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">good that it goes on indicating to you that you are living a false life. That's why the fear is </div>
<div id="td_51" class="t s1_51">there.Just take the hint, and don't try to change the symptom; rather try to change the </div>
<div id="te_51" class="t s1_51">basic cause. </div>
<div id="tf_51" class="t s1_51">From the very beginning every child has been misinformed, and misinformed, has been </div>
<div id="tg_51" class="t s1_51">misdirected, misguided. Not knowingly, because the parents are also in the same trap; </div>
<div id="th_51" class="t s1_51">they have been misguided. For example, if a child is too energetic, the family feels </div>
<div id="ti_51" class="t s1_51">uncomfortable, because a too energetic child is a revolution in the home. Nothing is safe, </div>
<div id="tj_51" class="t s1_51">nothing at all is safe. The energetic child will destroy everything. He has to be stopped. </div>
<div id="tk_51" class="t s1_51">His energy has to be blocked, his life has to be diminished. He has to be condemned, </div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s1_51">punished, and only rewarded when he behaves. And what do you eXpect? You expect </div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">him to be almost an old man -- not doing any harm to anything that you think is very </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">precious. Just to save a clock you destroy the child. Or to save your crockery you destroy </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">the child. Or to save your furniture; otherwise it will be scratched from this end to that. </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">You destroy a newly arrived being, a gift from God. You go on scratching the being of </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">the child just to save the furniture from being scratched. </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">By and by the child is forced to follow you because he is helpless. He depends on you; </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">his survival depends on you. Just to survive, he accepts to be dead. Just to survive, </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">because you give him food and milk and care. Where will he go if you are so much </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">against him? By and by he goes on selling his being to you. Whatsoever you say, by and </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">by he accepts. Your rewards and your punishments are the way you misguide him. </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">By and by he trusts you more than his own inner voice because he knows his inner voice </div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s1_51">always leads him into trouble. His inner voice has always proved to bring punishment, so </div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s1_51">punishment and his inner voice become associated. And whenever he does not listen to </div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s1_51">the inner voice and simply follows you blindly, he is rewarded. Whenever he is himself </div>
<div id="t10_51" class="t s1_51">he is punished; whenever he is not himself he is rewarded. The logic is clear. </div>
<div id="t11_51" class="t s1_51">By and by you distract him from his own life. By and by he forgets what his inner voice </div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s1_51">is. If you don't hear it for a long time, you cannot hear it. </div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s1_51">Close your eyes any moment: you will hear the voice of your father, your mother, your </div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s1_51">peers, teachers, and you will never hear your voice. Many people come to me and they </div>
<div id="t15_51" class="t s1_51">say, "You talk about the inner voice; we never hear it." There is a crowd. When Jesus </div>
<div id="t16_51" class="t s1_51">says, "Hate your father and mother," he is not actually saying to hate your father and </div>
<div id="t17_51" class="t s1_51">mother. He is saying hate the father and the mother which have become consciences </div>
<div id="t18_51" class="t s1_51">within you. Hate, because that is the most ugly agreement you have made -- a suicidal </div>
<div id="t19_51" class="t s1_51">contract. Hate, destroy those voices, so that your voice can be freed and liberated, so that </div>
<div id="t1a_51" class="t s1_51">you can feel who you are and what you want tO be. </div>
