<div id="t1_59" class="t s1_59">The mind is very ordinary, mundane. It is useful for day-to-day work; its </div>
<div id="t2_59" class="t s1_59">function is in the outside world. In the inner world it is absolutely useless. Those </div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s1_59">who want to know their inner being have to go beyond mind. </div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">They have to leave the mind behind. </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">That is the whole process of meditation. </div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s1_59">One word TATHAGATA has to be understood. The translator could not find any </div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s1_59">word to translate it; perhaps he could not even understand the meaning of the </div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s1_59">word because in the West and in Western languages, no parallel word exists. </div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s1_59">Tathagata is specifically a Buddhist term. Gautam Buddha preached the </div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s1_59">philosophy of TATHATA and tathata is very close to the word `suchness.' </div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s1_59">Whatever happens, Buddha says, such is the nature of things. There is no need to </div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s1_59">be happy, there is no need to be miserable, there is no need to be affected at all </div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">by anything that happens. Birth happens, death happens, but you have to remain </div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s1_59">in a suchness, remembering that this is how life functions. </div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s1_59">This is the way of life. </div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s1_59">You cannot do anything against it. </div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s1_59">Just as rivers move towards the ocean, that is their suchness. Just as fire is hot, </div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s1_59">that is its suchness. Suchness is our self-nature. </div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s1_59">So whatever happens ...somebody comes and insults Gautam Buddha, abuses </div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s1_59">him. He listens silently and when asked by his disciples, when the man went, </div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s1_59">"Why did you remain silent?" Buddha said, "That was his suchness, that was his </div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s1_59">way of behaving. It was my suchness to remain silent. I'm not holier than that </div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s1_59">man, I'm not higher than that man, just our suchness is different, our natures </div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s1_59">differ." </div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s1_59">The word tathata is of great profundity. A man who understands what tathata is </div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s1_59">becomes undisturbed in every situation; nothing can disturb him, he becomes </div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s1_59">unperturbable. And TATHAGAT means one who has been living moment-to-</div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s1_59">moment in tathata. Tathagat is one of the most beautiful words possible in any </div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s1_59">language: one who lives simply according to his nature without being bothered </div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s1_59">about other people's nature. </div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s1_59">Gautam Buddha used to say, "Once I was passing through a forest, and a branch </div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s1_59">of a tree fell on me. What do you think? Should I beat that branch of the tree </div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s1_59">because it hurt me, it wounded me?" The person to whom he was talking said, </div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s1_59">"There is no question of beating the branch; it had no desire to hurt you, it had no </div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s1_59">desire to fall on you. It was just a natural accident that you happened to be under </div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s1_59">the tree when the branch fell." </div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s1_59">Buddha said, "If somebody insults me, that is also the same. I simply happened </div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s1_59">to be there and that man was full of anger. If I had not been there he would have </div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s1_59">been angry with somebody else. It was his nature; he was following his nature. I </div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s1_59">followed my nature." </div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s1_59">And to be in tune with your nature, you certainly become impenetrable, </div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s1_59">unperturbable. You become so crystallized in yourself that nothing can disturb </div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s1_59">you. </div>
