<div id="t1_324" class="t s1_324">CHAPTER 27. RELIGION – THE LAST LUXURY</div>
<div id="t2_324" class="t s2_324">is the thing that you are looking for. You can become the president of the country or a prime minister</div>
<div id="t3_324" class="t s2_324">of a country. And life is short; much of it you have wasted in earning money and now you will waste</div>
<div id="t4_324" class="t s2_324">it to get into power. And there is a ladder; rung by rung, you have to go up the ladder. And there is</div>
<div id="t5_324" class="t s2_324">always a rung higher than you, signaling you: ”Come up, here is the thing that you want.”</div>
<div id="t6_324" class="t s2_324">When you reach that rung, there is another rung above you. Once in a while, some stubborn idiot</div>
<div id="t7_324" class="t s2_324">succeeds in reaching the last rung, from where there is nowhere to go because there is no higher</div>
<div id="t8_324" class="t s2_324">rung any more – the ladder has ended. But when you have made so much effort to reach it, can</div>
<div id="t9_324" class="t s2_324">you admit to those who are struggling below you, ”Don’t bother. I have found nothing here. I have</div>
<div id="ta_324" class="t s2_324">wasted my whole life and now I am standing on the ladder’s highest rung, and all I can do is jump</div>
<div id="tb_324" class="t s2_324">and commit suicide. There is nothing else here”? Now, that will mean you accept your stupidity. No,</div>
<div id="tc_324" class="t s2_324">a man who has been working so hard to reach the top... and by the time he reaches, he is almost</div>
<div id="td_324" class="t s2_324">near his grave. Now it is better to go on, smiling – a Jimmy Carter smile.</div>
<div id="te_324" class="t s2_324">I really feel sorry for Jimmy Carter. He is really a poor man. He had to come down from the topmost</div>
<div id="tf_324" class="t s2_324">rung – back to earth. Now all the smile has disappeared. I have seen his photographs since he</div>
<div id="tg_324" class="t s2_324">lost the election, continually looking at his photographs: not a single photograph of that big smile,</div>
<div id="th_324" class="t s2_324">which must have been the biggest in the whole world. What happened to that smile? That smile</div>
<div id="ti_324" class="t s2_324">was phony. Even when he was on the last rung it was phony. But when you have been in the game</div>
<div id="tj_324" class="t s2_324">of phoniness, in the game of politics, you become so accustomed to it that even seeing that by your</div>
<div id="tk_324" class="t s2_324">side is just suicide</div>
<div id="tl_324" class="t s2_324">....</div>
<div id="tm_324" class="t s2_324">The American people are very wise. They have assassinated twenty percent of their presidents.</div>
<div id="tn_324" class="t s2_324">That is great wisdom. They saved those twenty percent of presidents from the same situation in</div>
<div id="to_324" class="t s2_324">which Jimmy Carter is. If somebody had shot him while he was smiling, at least he could have had</div>
<div id="tp_324" class="t s2_324">the last smile. Death anyway is going to come. Now it will come, but there will be no smile.</div>
<div id="tq_324" class="t s2_324">Anyone becoming a president of a country then tries to remain the president until he dies. Everybody</div>
<div id="tr_324" class="t s2_324">wants to die as the president, as the prime minister – whatsoever is the highest post. Because he</div>
<div id="ts_324" class="t s2_324">has devoted his whole life to growing this phony personality, now at least let him have the honor of</div>
<div id="tt_324" class="t s2_324">death as a president of the country, or as a prime minister of a country. Yes, he deserves it; he has</div>
<div id="tu_324" class="t s2_324">worked hard for it. And mostly it happens that either he is assassinated, or he dies of a heart attack.</div>
<div id="tv_324" class="t s2_324">India has had six prime ministers since independence.</div>
<div id="tw_324" class="t s2_324">The ﬁrst prime minister was Jawaharlal</div>
<div id="tx_324" class="t s2_324">Nehru, the best politician amongst all the political leaders of the world, for the simple reason that</div>
<div id="ty_324" class="t s2_324">he was not a politician. He was drawn to the freedom struggle of India, and had no idea of being in</div>
<div id="tz_324" class="t s2_324">power. He was not meant to be a politician. He had such a sensitive soul that he could have been a</div>
<div id="t10_324" class="t s2_324">great poet, painter, musician – anything, but not a politician.</div>
<div id="t11_324" class="t s2_324">I had several meetings with him. He was in absolute agreement with my ideas, but said to me with</div>
<div id="t12_324" class="t s2_324">tears in his eyes, ”Whatsoever you are saying can transform the whole future of India, but you don’t</div>
<div id="t13_324" class="t s2_324">have any idea of the collective mind of the masses. They cannot understand what you are saying;</div>
<div id="t14_324" class="t s2_324">they will be against you. You cannot succeed in transforming their mind, you can only succeed in</div>
<div id="t15_324" class="t s2_324">being cruciﬁed by them.”</div>
<div id="t16_324" class="t s2_324">He was shocked by the Chinese invasion of India. He fell sick and could never recover from the</div>
<div id="t17_324" class="t s2_324">shock. He died as the prime minister of India. He was a great preacher of peace, brotherhood,</div>
<div id="t18_324" class="t s2_324">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t19_324" class="t s2_324">324</div>
<div id="t1a_324" class="t s3_324">Osho</div>
