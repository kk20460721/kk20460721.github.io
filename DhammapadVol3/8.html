<div id="t1_8" class="t s1_8">The last statement of Gautama the Buddha to his disciples was: Be a light unto yourself. </div>
<div id="t2_8" class="t s1_8">They were crying and weeping, naturally -- the master was leaving and they had lived </div>
<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">with the master for almost forty years; a few older disciples had lived with him the </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">whole time. These forty years were of tremendous joy, of great experiences. These forty </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">years had been the most beautiful time possible, humanly possible. These forty years </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">had been days of paradise on earth. And now the master is leaving! It was natural, they </div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s1_8">started crying and weeping. </div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">Buddha opened his eyes and said, "Stop crying and weeping! Have you not listened to </div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">me yet? Why are you crying?" </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">His chief disciple, Ananda, said, "Because you are leaving, because our light is leaving. </div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s1_8">We see, we feel darkness descending upon us. I have not yet become enlightened and </div>
<div id="tc_8" class="t s1_8">you are leaving. If I could not become enlightened while you were alive, what is the </div>
<div id="td_8" class="t s1_8">hope for me now when you will be gone? I am in great despair, my anguish is </div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s1_8">incalculable, I have wasted these forty years. I have been following you like a shadow, it </div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s1_8">was tremendously beautiful to be with you, but now you are leaving. What is going to </div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s1_8">happen to us?" </div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s1_8">Buddha said, "You are crying because you have not heard me yet. I have been telling </div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">you again and again: Don't believe in me -- but you have not listened. Because you have </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">believed in me, and now I am dying, your whole structure is falling apart. Had you </div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">listened to me, had you created a light into your being rather than becoming </div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">knowledgeable through me, if you had experienced your own self there would have </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">been no need to cry. </div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s1_8">"Look at Manjushree!" he said -- Manjushree was another disciple of Buddha, one of the </div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s1_8">greatest. He was sitting under a tree just close by, with closed eyes, so serene, so quiet, </div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s1_8">so utterly blissful, that Buddha said, "Look at Manjushree! Go and ask him why he is </div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s1_8">not crying." </div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s1_8">They asked Manjushree. He laughed and said, "What reason is there to cry? Buddha has </div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s1_8">helped me to know my own light. I am thankful, I am grateful, but there is no darkness </div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s1_8">descending. And how can Buddha die? I know I cannot die -- how can Buddha die? He </div>
<div id="tu_8" class="t s1_8">will be here. Just as a river disappears in the ocean he will disappear into the cosmos. </div>
<div id="tv_8" class="t s1_8">But he will be here! He will be spread all over the cosmos. It is going to be something </div>
<div id="tw_8" class="t s1_8">tremendously beautiful. Buddha was confined to a small body; now his fragrance will </div>
<div id="tx_8" class="t s1_8">be released, he will permeate the whole of existence. I am tremendously happy that </div>
<div id="ty_8" class="t s1_8">now Buddha will be spread all over space. I will be able to see him rising in the sun and </div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s1_8">I will be able to see him flying in a bird and I will be able to see him in the waves of the </div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">ocean... and I will be able to see him everywhere. </div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s1_8">"He is simply leaving his body. It was a confinement. And how do I know it? I know it </div>
<div id="t12_8" class="t s1_8">because I have known my own soul. I listened to him and you have not listened to him -</div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s1_8">- that's why you are crying." </div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s1_8">Buddha said, "Let me repeat again: APPA DIPO BHAVA -- be a light unto yourself." </div>
<div id="t15_8" class="t s1_8">Then he closed his eyes and disappeared into the cosmos. But his last statement was </div>
<div id="t16_8" class="t s1_8">also his first statement. In fact that was his whole message -- the whole of his life he was </div>
<div id="t17_8" class="t s1_8">repeating the same message again and again and again. </div>
