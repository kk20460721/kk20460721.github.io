<div id="t4_229" class="t s1_229">twelve years were a great suffering, but not because you had gone; I suffered because you did</div>
<div id="t5_229" class="t s1_229">not tell me. If you had simply told me that you were going to seek the truth, do you think I</div>
<div id="t6_229" class="t s1_229">would have prevented you? You have insulted me very badly. This is the wound that I have</div>
<div id="t7_229" class="t s1_229">been carrying for twelve years.</div>
<div id="t8_229" class="t s1_229">It was not that you had gone in search of truth -- that is something to rejoice in; not that</div>
<div id="t9_229" class="t s1_229">you had gone to become enlightened -- I would not have prevented you. I also belong to the</div>

<div id="tb_229" class="t s1_229">you?</div>
<div id="tc_229" class="t s1_229">"All these twelve years my only suffering was that you did not trust me. I would have</div>
<div id="td_229" class="t s1_229">allowed you, I would have given you a send off, I would have come up to the chariot. First I</div>
<div id="te_229" class="t s1_229">want to ask the only question that has been in my mind for all these twelve years, which is that</div>

<div id="tk_229" class="t s1_229">have attained, was it not possible to attain it here in this palace? Can the palace prevent the</div>
<div id="tl_229" class="t s1_229">truth?"</div>
<div id="tm_229" class="t s1_229">It is a tremendously intelligent question, and Gautam Buddha had to agree: "I could have</div>

<div id="tx_229" class="t s1_229">did not trust you; it was really that I did not trust myself. I knew that there was a wavering; I</div>
<div id="ty_229" class="t s1_229">was not total in renouncing. A part of me was saying, 'What are you doing?' -- and a part of</div>
<div id="tz_229" class="t s1_229">me was saying, 'This is the time to do it. If you don't do it now it will become more and more</div>
<div id="t10_229" class="t s1_229">difficult. Your father is preparing to crown you. Once you are crowned as king, it will be more</div>

<div id="t13_229" class="t s1_229">immensely happy that you have been absolutely truthful in saying that it can be attained here,</div>
<div id="t14_229" class="t s1_229">it can be attained anywhere. Now your son, who is just standing there, a little boy of twelve</div>
<div id="t15_229" class="t s1_229">years, has been continually asking about you, and I have been telling him, 'Just wait. He will</div>
<div id="t16_229" class="t s1_229">come back; he cannot be so cruel, he cannot be so unkind, he cannot be so inhuman. One day</div>
<div id="t17_229" class="t s1_229">he will come. Perhaps whatever he has gone to realize is taking time; once he has realized it,</div>
<div id="t18_229" class="t s1_229">the first thing he will do is to come back.'</div>
