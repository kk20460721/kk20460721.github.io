<div id="t1_102" class="t s1_102">Now, with your death, starts my dark night of the soul. For aeons of time, </div>
<div id="t2_102" class="t s1_102">millions of years, I will be stumbling in the darkness. Hence I am crying -- not for </div>
<div id="t3_102" class="t s1_102">you, for myself.' </div>
<div id="t4_102" class="t s1_102">Buddha smiled and said, 'Don't be worried about that, because your light is in </div>
<div id="t5_102" class="t s1_102">your own being. I am not taking your light away. I was not your light. Otherwise </div>
<div id="t6_102" class="t s1_102">you could have become enlightened -- if it was in my power to make you </div>
<div id="t7_102" class="t s1_102">enlightened. It is your innermost capacity to become, so be courageous, Ananda, </div>
<div id="t8_102" class="t s1_102">and be a light unto yourself... appa deepo bhava... be a light unto yourself.' </div>
<div id="t9_102" class="t s1_102">Buddha died and after only twenty-four hours, Ananda became enlightened. </div>
<div id="ta_102" class="t s1_102">What happened? This is one of the mysteries. For forty years he lived with </div>
<div id="tb_102" class="t s1_102">Buddha, and just twenty-four hours after Buddha died, he became enlightened. </div>
<div id="tc_102" class="t s1_102">The very death worked like a great shock. And the last message penetrated very </div>
<div id="td_102" class="t s1_102">deep. </div>
<div id="te_102" class="t s1_102">When Buddha was alive, Ananda was listening so-so -- as you listen to me. You </div>
<div id="tf_102" class="t s1_102">listen and yet you don't listen. You say, 'Okay. If I miss today, tomorrow I will be </div>
<div id="tg_102" class="t s1_102">listening again, so what is the hurry? If this morning is missed, nothing is </div>
<div id="th_102" class="t s1_102">missed; other mornings will be following.' </div>
<div id="ti_102" class="t s1_102">So he had listened half-asleep, half-awake. Maybe he was tired, maybe the night </div>
<div id="tj_102" class="t s1_102">was not good and he had not slept. Maybe the journey was too long and too </div>
<div id="tk_102" class="t s1_102">exhausting. And Buddha was saying the same thing again and again and again, </div>
<div id="tl_102" class="t s1_102">so how long to listen? One starts feeling that one already knows. One starts </div>
<div id="tm_102" class="t s1_102">feeling, 'Yes, I have heard this before, so what is the point? Why not take a little </div>
<div id="tn_102" class="t s1_102">sleep? A little nap will be good.' </div>
<div id="to_102" class="t s1_102">But when Buddha was dying, Ananda must have been alert, utterly alert. He was </div>
<div id="tp_102" class="t s1_102">really trembling -- the very idea of millions of years again stumbling in darkness. </div>
<div id="tq_102" class="t s1_102">And Buddha says, 'Don't be worried, your light is within you.' That struck home. </div>
<div id="tr_102" class="t s1_102">Maybe that was the first time he heard. Those forty years he must have been </div>
<div id="ts_102" class="t s1_102">missing. That may have been the first time he was not deaf. He had clarity. The </div>
<div id="tt_102" class="t s1_102">very situation was such that he was trembling to his roots, he was shaking to his </div>
<div id="tu_102" class="t s1_102">very foundations. Buddha was leaving... and when you have lived with a man </div>
<div id="tv_102" class="t s1_102">like Buddha for forty years, it is difficult. The very idea to be without him is </div>
<div id="tw_102" class="t s1_102">difficult. It is impossible to believe. </div>
<div id="tx_102" class="t s1_102">Ananda must have thought of committing suicide. It is not reported in the </div>
<div id="ty_102" class="t s1_102">buddhist scriptures, but I say he must have thought about committing suicide. </div>
<div id="tz_102" class="t s1_102">That idea must have happened to him; it is so human. Living forty years with </div>
<div id="t10_102" class="t s1_102">Buddha, and then Buddha is dying and nothing has happened to him. He has </div>
<div id="t11_102" class="t s1_102">remained desertlike, not even an oasis. He has missed the opportunity. </div>
<div id="t12_102" class="t s1_102">His eyes must have become clear. This death must have penetrated him like a </div>
<div id="t13_102" class="t s1_102">sword. Sharp must have been this moment. And Buddha said, 'Be a light unto </div>
<div id="t14_102" class="t s1_102">yourself,' and he died. He died immediately. This was his last utterance on this </div>
<div id="t15_102" class="t s1_102">earth: Be a light unto yourself. </div>
<div id="t16_102" class="t s1_102">This struck home, this penetrated Ananda's heart, and within twenty-four hours </div>
<div id="t17_102" class="t s1_102">he became enlightened. </div>
