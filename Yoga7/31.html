<div id="t4_31" class="t s1_31">have more to cling to. Now your ego is almost so decorated</div>
<div id="t5_31" class="t s1_31">....</div>
<div id="t6_31" class="t s1_31">I was reading the autobiography of a very well-known novelist. Towards the end </div>
<div id="t7_31" class="t s1_31">of his life he used to say to everybody and complain, "I wasted my life. I never </div>
<div id="t8_31" class="t s1_31">wanted to be a novelist -- never." Somebody asked him, "Then why didn't you </div>
<div id="t9_31" class="t s1_31">stop? Because for at least twenty years I have been listening to you, and I know </div>
<div id="ta_31" class="t s1_31">people who say that they have been listening to your complaint even longer. </div>
<div id="tb_31" class="t s1_31">Why didn't you stop?" He said. "How could I? Because by the time I realized that </div>
<div id="tc_31" class="t s1_31">this is not my vocation, I had already become famous. By the time I realized that </div>
<div id="td_31" class="t s1_31">this is not my vocation, I was already a famous novelist. </div>
<div id="te_31" class="t s1_31">You cannot drop the ego if you go on decorating it. Your knowledge decorates it. </div>
<div id="tf_31" class="t s1_31">Your going to the church decorates it -- you become religious. Your reading the </div>
<div id="tg_31" class="t s1_31">Bible every day, or the Geeta, decorates it. You can look at others with the look </div>
<div id="th_31" class="t s1_31">"holier than you." You can look with a condemnation in your eye, that the whole </div>
<div id="ti_31" class="t s1_31">world is going to the hell -- except you. </div>
<div id="tj_31" class="t s1_31">You go on trying to become humble, to become simple, but deep down in your </div>
<div id="tk_31" class="t s1_31">simplicity sits the ego, enthroned. </div>
<div id="tl_31" class="t s1_31">And you go on finding rationalizations for it. All rationalizations are decorations. </div>
<div id="tm_31" class="t s1_31">In India there was one man, he died a few years before. Nizam of Hyderabad. He </div>
<div id="tn_31" class="t s1_31">was the richest man in the whole world. Your Rockefellers and Fords are </div>
<div id="to_31" class="t s1_31">nothing. He was the richest man in the world. In fact nobody knows how much </div>
<div id="tp_31" class="t s1_31">he had exactly because all his wealth consisted of millions of diamonds. In seven </div>
<div id="tq_31" class="t s1_31">big halls the diamonds were put; the halls were completely full. Even he was not </div>
<div id="tr_31" class="t s1_31">aware of the exact number. But the man was a great miser -- you cannot believe. </div>
<div id="ts_31" class="t s1_31">You will simply say that I am lying. He was such a miser that when guests will </div>
<div id="tt_31" class="t s1_31">come and they will leave their half cigarettes on the ashtray, he will collect them </div>
<div id="tu_31" class="t s1_31">and smoke them. You will not believe me, but this is a truth. </div>
<div id="tv_31" class="t s1_31">When he became Nizam of Hyderabad, he was enthroned, he used the same cap </div>
<div id="tw_31" class="t s1_31">for forty years. That was the dirtiest cap in the world. It was never washed </div>
<div id="tx_31" class="t s1_31">because he was afraid it may be destroyed. He lived the life of a very poor man, </div>
<div id="ty_31" class="t s1_31">but he used to say to his people. "I am a simple man. Maybe I am the richest man, </div>
<div id="tz_31" class="t s1_31">but I live the life of a poor man." But he was not poor. He was simply a miser! He </div>
<div id="t10_31" class="t s1_31">used to say that because he is not attached to things and worldly exhibitions, </div>
<div id="t11_31" class="t s1_31">that's why he lives such a simple life. He used to think himself a sadhu, a fakir. </div>
<div id="t12_31" class="t s1_31">He was not. He was the most miserly man ever the richest and the most miserly. </div>
<div id="t13_31" class="t s1_31">But for his miserliness, He will find rationalizations. </div>
<div id="t14_31" class="t s1_31">He was so afraid, so superstitious</div>
<div id="t15_31" class="t s1_31">....</div>
<div id="t16_31" class="t s1_31">He used to pray and he used to pretend that </div>
<div id="t17_31" class="t s1_31">he is a great prayer. But he was not; he was simply afraid. In the night he used to </div>
<div id="t18_31" class="t s1_31">sleep with a peculiar thing. He had a big pot which he used to fill with salt, and </div>
<div id="t19_31" class="t s1_31">in the pot he will put one of his feet -- the whole night. Because Mohammedans </div>
<div id="t1a_31" class="t s1_31">have an idea that if your feet are touching salt, ghosts cannot trouble you. </div>
