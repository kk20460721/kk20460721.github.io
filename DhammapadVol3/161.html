<div id="t4_161" class="t s1_161">bothered by it. He laughs at it, he takes it for granted that life is a mystery. There is no </div>
<div id="t5_161" class="t s1_161">question and there is no answer. </div>
<div id="t6_161" class="t s1_161">Life is not a question-answer game. It is not a puzzle to be solved, it is a mystery to be </div>

<div id="t8_161" class="t s1_161">"Pa, I wanna go to college," said Leon. </div>

<div id="tc_161" class="t s1_161">you find out what is what, I send you to college." </div>
<div id="td_161" class="t s1_161">Leon went into the bathroom, thought a few minutes, came out and said, "Pa, I don't </div>
<div id="te_161" class="t s1_161">know what is what." </div>
<div id="tf_161" class="t s1_161">"Sure you don't know what is what. Go out and get yourself a job and when you find </div>
<div id="tg_161" class="t s1_161">out what is what I send you to college." </div>
<div id="th_161" class="t s1_161">Leon left, went to a nearby bar, and began drinking. He met Alice, a blonde sitting at </div>
<div id="ti_161" class="t s1_161">the bar. Soon they wound up at her apartment. After a few drinks she said, "Excuse me </div>
<div id="tj_161" class="t s1_161">while I slip into something more comfortable." </div>
<div id="tk_161" class="t s1_161">Alice returned a few moments later, completely nude. Leon looked at her and said, </div>

<div id="tm_161" class="t s1_161">"What is what?" </div>

<div id="tp_161" class="t s1_161">master: what is what. </div>
<div id="tq_161" class="t s1_161">Now you are asking, "Who am I?" You are yourself, you are you. To ask, "Who am I?" </div>
<div id="tr_161" class="t s1_161">means you are asking for some identity, whether "I am A or B or C or D." You are </div>
<div id="ts_161" class="t s1_161">simply yourself! You cannot be A, you cannot be B, you cannot be C. You are just </div>
<div id="tt_161" class="t s1_161">yourself, you are nothing else. So there is no way to answer it. </div>
<div id="tu_161" class="t s1_161">Then why is this question given to you? This question is given to you so that it can </div>
<div id="tv_161" class="t s1_161">destroy; it is like a hammer, it can destroy all your old identities. For example, you </div>
<div id="tw_161" class="t s1_161">think, "My name is Ram, so I am Ram." When you ask, "Who am I?" the question will </div>
<div id="tx_161" class="t s1_161">arise, "What about Ram? I am Ram!" But you can see that that is only a name; it is not </div>
<div id="ty_161" class="t s1_161">your reality, it is a given name from the outside. Your parents had to call you </div>
<div id="tz_161" class="t s1_161">something: they called you "Ram." They could have called you "Rahim," they could </div>
<div id="t10_161" class="t s1_161">have given you any name, and any name would have been as relevant as Ram, because </div>
<div id="t11_161" class="t s1_161">you are a nameless reality. So asking, "Who am I?" you will forget this identity with </div>
<div id="t12_161" class="t s1_161">Ram. </div>
<div id="t13_161" class="t s1_161">Then deep down somebody says, "I am a Jaina," "I am a Hindu," "I am a Jew." That too </div>
<div id="t14_161" class="t s1_161">is an accidental identity -- accidents of birth -- you are not it. How can you be a Jew? </div>
