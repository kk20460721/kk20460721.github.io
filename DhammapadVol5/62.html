<div id="t2_62" class="t s1_62">good things have to be avoided. </div>
<div id="t3_62" class="t s1_62">A child was talking to his mother, "You say God is very wise. I don't believe it." </div>
<div id="t4_62" class="t s1_62">The mother said, "But why don't you believe it?" </div>
<div id="t5_62" class="t s1_62">He said, "If he was wise, he would have put more vitamins in ice cream. He puts </div>
<div id="t6_62" class="t s1_62">vitamins in things which are uneatable, and things which are really worth eating are </div>
<div id="t7_62" class="t s1_62">dangerous." </div>
<div id="t8_62" class="t s1_62">How long will you avoid ice cream? The temptation will be such that it will be </div>
<div id="t9_62" class="t s1_62">unavoidable. So you can lose weight for a few days and then you will eat too much, you </div>
<div id="ta_62" class="t s1_62">will take revenge. And you may gain more weight than you had lost by dieting. This is </div>
<div id="tb_62" class="t s1_62">the pattern of millions of people, particularly in the West. </div>
<div id="tc_62" class="t s1_62">In the East people are starving. You can see a few fat people in Bombay, in Delhi, in </div>
<div id="td_62" class="t s1_62">Calcutta, but that's all. If you go to the real India, eighty percent of the people in India </div>
<div id="te_62" class="t s1_62">are starving. There is no question of gaining more weight, they don't have enough </div>
<div id="tf_62" class="t s1_62">weight. They are suffering from malnutrition. Yes, sometimes you will find villagers </div>
<div id="tg_62" class="t s1_62">with big bellies and thin bodies, because they are eating food which is not nourishing, </div>
<div id="th_62" class="t s1_62">unbalanced, and they eat only when it is available. So when it is available they eat too </div>
<div id="ti_62" class="t s1_62">much. </div>
<div id="tj_62" class="t s1_62">There are millions of people in India who eat only once a day because they can't afford </div>
<div id="tk_62" class="t s1_62">to eat twice. So to keep their bodies together for twenty-four hours they eat anything, </div>
<div id="tl_62" class="t s1_62">whatsoever is available; sometimes they have to eat the roots of trees. </div>
<div id="tm_62" class="t s1_62">So the problem is not in the East, the problem is in the West where enough food is </div>
<div id="tn_62" class="t s1_62">available and people have completely forgotten that food grows on trees. Children </div>
<div id="to_62" class="t s1_62">know that food grows in the fridges. You go to the fridge any time and food is </div>
<div id="tp_62" class="t s1_62">available. </div>
<div id="tq_62" class="t s1_62">I have heard about a woman who must have been suffering like Sangito. She went to </div>
<div id="tr_62" class="t s1_62">her psychiatrist and asked him his advice -- what to do? He pondered over the problem </div>
<div id="ts_62" class="t s1_62">and gave her a picture, a picture of a naked woman, such an ugly fat woman, </div>
<div id="tt_62" class="t s1_62">disgusting, nauseating, sickening -- just to see it was enough to become afraid of food. </div>
<div id="tu_62" class="t s1_62">And he told the woman, "Stick it inside your fridge so that whenever you open it you </div>
<div id="tv_62" class="t s1_62">will see this picture -- this will remind you of what is going to happen to you." </div>
<div id="tw_62" class="t s1_62">So she sticks in the picture of the naked woman. The psychiatrist has also given her </div>
<div id="tx_62" class="t s1_62">another picture of a beautiful young woman with a very proportionate body, a world </div>
<div id="ty_62" class="t s1_62">beauty, and has told her, "Stick this in too, so you can compare. If you don't eat too </div>
<div id="tz_62" class="t s1_62">much you will be like this woman, if you eat too much you will be like that one." </div>
<div id="t10_62" class="t s1_62">Immediately, from the next day, the woman starts losing weight. But a miracle happens: </div>
<div id="t11_62" class="t s1_62">her husband starts gaining weight. The woman is puzzled. She says, "What is the </div>
<div id="t12_62" class="t s1_62">matter?" </div>
<div id="t13_62" class="t s1_62">He says, "Since you have put that beautiful naked woman inside the fridge, I go again </div>
<div id="t14_62" class="t s1_62">and again to see the picture. And when I see the picture I see the food too, and the </div>
