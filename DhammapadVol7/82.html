<div id="t2_82" class="t s1_82">will be more than willing. He wants to catch hold of you, he wants you to be his </div>
<div id="t3_82" class="t s1_82">disciple. He will be ready, very much ready, to fulfill your expectations so that you </div>
<div id="t4_82" class="t s1_82">don't leave him. </div>
<div id="t5_82" class="t s1_82">The true master lives according to his light. You cannot expect anything from him. </div>
<div id="t6_82" class="t s1_82">Unless you are ready to drop all your expectations you can't live with the true master. </div>
<div id="t7_82" class="t s1_82">The false master will always buttress your ego. He will say, "You are great, you are </div>
<div id="t8_82" class="t s1_82">virtuous." He will give you small tricks to feel virtuous: "Go every Sunday to the church </div>
<div id="t9_82" class="t s1_82">and you will be virtuous, religious, spiritual." Now, just by going to the church every </div>
<div id="ta_82" class="t s1_82">Sunday do you think you become spiritual? Is spirituality so cheap? But he will give </div>
<div id="tb_82" class="t s1_82">you cheap things which you can easily purchase and feel great. </div>
<div id="tc_82" class="t s1_82">With the true master, real work has to be done. The real master works on you just like a </div>
<div id="td_82" class="t s1_82">sculptor, with the chisel and hammer in his hand. He starts dismantling you, because </div>
<div id="te_82" class="t s1_82">that is the only way to transform you, to give you a new birth. He starts killing you! A </div>
<div id="tf_82" class="t s1_82">real master is a death, because only after death is there a possibility of resurrection. </div>
<div id="tg_82" class="t s1_82">I was without a master. I stumbled in darkness on my own. It was hard work, it was </div>
<div id="th_82" class="t s1_82">maddening, because nobody was there even to give me hope, any guarantee -- even to </div>
<div id="ti_82" class="t s1_82">give me just simple sympathy that I am on the right track. I was moving into the </div>
<div id="tj_82" class="t s1_82">uncharted sea without anybody encouraging me. </div>
<div id="tk_82" class="t s1_82">You are far more fortunate. I can tell you when you are right and when you are wrong. I </div>

<div id="tm_82" class="t s1_82">will start changing; the spring is just on the way. Any moment it will be here. In fact, </div>
<div id="tn_82" class="t s1_82">the first flowers have started appearing. You may not be able to see those first flowers. I </div>

<div id="tr_82" class="t s1_82">be predicted beforehand. It has become possible through Kirlian photography. It gives </div>
<div id="ts_82" class="t s1_82">the photograph of your body energy, and it shows where the body energy is going </div>
<div id="tt_82" class="t s1_82">wrong. Six months before you may actually fall ill, Kirlian photography starts giving </div>

<div id="tx_82" class="t s1_82">not yet visible to you or to anybody else -- but can be visible to the master. He can </div>
<div id="ty_82" class="t s1_82">recognize the signs, the invisible indications. He can decipher the language of the </div>
<div id="tz_82" class="t s1_82">unknown and the unknowable. He can tell you, "Go on!" Buddha says to his disciples </div>

<div id="t15_82" class="t s1_82">sunrise before. </div>
<div id="t16_82" class="t s1_82">I worked hard in every possible way, but the day I came to know who I am was a great </div>
