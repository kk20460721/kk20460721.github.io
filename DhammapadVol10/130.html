<div id="t1_130" class="t s1_130">Buddha says: MASTER YOUR SENSES</div>
<div id="t2_130" class="t s1_130">....</div>
<div id="t3_130" class="t s1_130">He could have simply said: Destroy your </div>
<div id="t4_130" class="t s1_130">senses. But mastery is a totally different phenomenon; it needs great art, skill, </div>
<div id="t5_130" class="t s1_130">awareness, meditativeness, watchfulness, alertness. Only then the senses will remain </div>
<div id="t6_130" class="t s1_130">there. In fact, the master is more sensitive than the slave. </div>
<div id="t7_130" class="t s1_130">My own understanding is that Buddha smells more deeply; his sense of smell is far </div>
<div id="t8_130" class="t s1_130">deeper than yours. Your sense of smell is repressed, very much repressed. For centuries </div>
<div id="t9_130" class="t s1_130">you have been repressing sex, and the sense of smell is very much connected with your </div>
<div id="ta_130" class="t s1_130">sexuality. You have been repressing your sense of smell. You use so many perfumes just </div>
<div id="tb_130" class="t s1_130">to hide the smell of your sexuality. Otherwise, when a woman has her period she smells </div>
<div id="tc_130" class="t s1_130">differently; you can smell that she has her period. When a woman is sexually aroused </div>
<div id="td_130" class="t s1_130">she starts smelling differently; you can know just by her smell that she is sexually </div>
<div id="te_130" class="t s1_130">aroused. And the same is true about man: sexually aroused, his body starts smelling </div>
<div id="tf_130" class="t s1_130">because there are great chemical changes happening inside him. They affect his body, </div>
<div id="tg_130" class="t s1_130">his perspiration, his breathing, his blood. </div>
<div id="th_130" class="t s1_130">Man has been so much afraid of his sexuality: somebody may become aware, somebody </div>
<div id="ti_130" class="t s1_130">may note what is happening to him. He has used clothes to hide his body, he has used </div>
<div id="tj_130" class="t s1_130">perfumes to hide his natural smells. He has tried in every possible way to appear as </div>
<div id="tk_130" class="t s1_130">nonsexual as possible. And we have had to repress our noses very much</div>
<div id="tl_130" class="t s1_130">....</div>
<div id="tm_130" class="t s1_130">You know the animals. They know through their noses whether the female is willing or </div>
<div id="tn_130" class="t s1_130">not. Just the nose is enough to know whether the female is saying yes. Unless the nose </div>
<div id="to_130" class="t s1_130">says the female is saying yes, the male won't approach the female. That is aggression, </div>
<div id="tp_130" class="t s1_130">that is rape. No animal ever rapes, remember, except man. Man is the only rapist animal </div>
<div id="tq_130" class="t s1_130">in the world. I am not including the animals who live in the zoos because they have </div>
<div id="tr_130" class="t s1_130">become more like human beings. Living in the company of human beings they have </div>
<div id="ts_130" class="t s1_130">been distorted; otherwise no animal rapes. Love happens only when both the parties are </div>
<div id="tt_130" class="t s1_130">absolutely willing. But man has lost his sensitivity of smell. It is because of the so-called </div>
<div id="tu_130" class="t s1_130">religious teaching down the centuries. </div>
<div id="tv_130" class="t s1_130">My understanding is that Buddha's sense of smell is far more clear than yours because </div>
<div id="tw_130" class="t s1_130">there is no repression in him. His eyes see better than you can see because his eyes are </div>
<div id="tx_130" class="t s1_130">not clouded by any prejudice, by any a priori conceptions. He hears perfectly well </div>
<div id="ty_130" class="t s1_130">because his ears are not full of noise, his mind is silent. </div>
<div id="tz_130" class="t s1_130">When the mind is utterly silent you are capable of listening. Then you are capable of </div>
<div id="t10_130" class="t s1_130">listening to the song of the birds, a distant call of the cuckoo. Then you are able to listen </div>
<div id="t11_130" class="t s1_130">even to the silence. Just now, listen to the silence... not only sound but soundlessness </div>
<div id="t12_130" class="t s1_130">can be listened to. But you have to be noiseless. </div>
<div id="t13_130" class="t s1_130">And you can start smelling people not only in their sexuality, you can start smelling </div>
<div id="t14_130" class="t s1_130">their anger because anger also changes their body chemistry. You can start smelling </div>
<div id="t15_130" class="t s1_130">their greed, their jealousy, their hatred. You can start smelling all kinds of emotions. </div>
<div id="t16_130" class="t s1_130">The moment a person comes to you, if your mind is silent and your senses are clear, </div>
<div id="t17_130" class="t s1_130">unclouded, without any fog, you can smell everything that the man is carrying. He may </div>
<div id="t18_130" class="t s1_130">be smiling on the surface, but deep down you can see that he is angry, a hypocrite. Try </div>
<div id="t19_130" class="t s1_130">smelling people -- their greed, their anger, their cruelty. </div>
