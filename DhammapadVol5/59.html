<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">psychology has been of any help; it has become part of the establishment. As priests </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">have been doing in the past, psychoanalysts are now doing the same: helping people to </div>

<div id="tb_59" class="t s1_59">tiny, pseudo, superficial, because the real revolution can happen only in the psyche of </div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s1_59">man, not in the social structure or the economic structure. A real revolution has nothing </div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">to do with politics; it has something to do with the spirituality of man. </div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s1_59">We have to create a new spirituality, a new vision. </div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s1_59">You say, Sarjana, "In my own life I have been blessed with encountering a few rare and </div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s1_59">wise psychiatrists, psychologists -- one of whom led me to you." </div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s1_59">But where is he? Now it is your duty to lead him to me. Pay him in the same coin! What </div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s1_59">is he doing there? He should be here! He must have read, he must have heard about me, </div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s1_59">but that is not the way to know me. The only way to know me is to be a sannyasin, is to </div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s1_59">be part of my energy field, to vibrate with me, to pulsate with me, to synchronize with </div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s1_59">me. Now this is your duty, you owe this to him. Help him to come here; he may be </div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s1_59">afraid to come himself. </div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s1_59">Just the other day I received a letter from Hari Chetana in Germany saying that on the </div>

<div id="tp_59" class="t s1_59">son went to Poona and there seems to be no possibility that he will ever come back. </div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s1_59">What do you say about it?" </div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s1_59">And the famous doctor said, "I have heard much about Poona, I have read also. You </div>

<div id="ty_59" class="t s1_59">These people know only one way of becoming acquainted with anything -- and that is </div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s1_59">reading, studying. These people are knowledgeable people, but not wise. </div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s1_59">We are helpless. We cannot do anything about Buddha -- we have to read him because </div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s1_59">he is no longer present. But how many times, reading Buddha and his beautiful sutras, </div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s1_59">has not the idea arisen in millions of hearts, "How fortunate it would have been if we </div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s1_59">had been alive in the time of Buddha." Or reading the beautiful words of Jesus has not </div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s1_59">the idea occurred to you that, "How tremendously blessed were those people who </div>

<div id="t16_59" class="t s1_59">wined with him"? Reading about Krishna have you not heard the distant, distant call of </div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s1_59">his flute? Have you not felt a little sad that now there is no possibility of encountering </div>
<div id="t18_59" class="t s1_59">this beautiful man? </div>
