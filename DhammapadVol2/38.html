<div id="t1_38" class="t s1_38">The king asked the other astrologers, "What do you suggest? What should I do so that </div>
<div id="t2_38" class="t s1_38">he does not renounce the world? I would not want him to be a beggar, I would not like </div>
<div id="t3_38" class="t s1_38">to see him a sannyasin. I would like him to become a chakravartin -- a ruler of all the six </div>
<div id="t4_38" class="t s1_38">continents." The ambition of all the parents. Who would like his son or daughter to </div>
<div id="t5_38" class="t s1_38">renounce the world and to move into the mountains, to go into one's own interiority, to </div>
<div id="t6_38" class="t s1_38">seek and search for the self? </div>
<div id="t7_38" class="t s1_38">Our desires are extrovert. The king was an ordinary man, just like everybody else -- </div>
<div id="t8_38" class="t s1_38">with the same desires and the same ambitions. The astrologers said, "It can be arranged: </div>
<div id="t9_38" class="t s1_38">give him as much pleasure as possible, keep him in as much comfort and luxury as is </div>
<div id="ta_38" class="t s1_38">humanly possible. Don't allow him to know about illness, old age, and particularly </div>
<div id="tb_38" class="t s1_38">death. Don't let him come to know about death and he will never renounce." </div>
<div id="tc_38" class="t s1_38">They were right in a way, because death is the central question. Once it arises in your </div>
<div id="td_38" class="t s1_38">heart, your life-style is bound to change. You cannot go on living in the old foolish way. </div>
<div id="te_38" class="t s1_38">If this life is going to end in death, then this life cannot be real life, then this life must be </div>
<div id="tf_38" class="t s1_38">an illusion. Truth has to be eternal if it is true -- only lies are momentary. If life is </div>
<div id="tg_38" class="t s1_38">momentary, then it must be an illusion, a lie, a misconception, a misunderstanding; </div>
<div id="th_38" class="t s1_38">then life must be rooted somewhere in ignorance. We must be living it in such a way </div>
<div id="ti_38" class="t s1_38">that it comes to an end. </div>
<div id="tj_38" class="t s1_38">We can live in a different way so that we can become part of the eternal flow of </div>
<div id="tk_38" class="t s1_38">existence. Only death can give you that radical shift. </div>
<div id="tl_38" class="t s1_38">So the astrologers said, "Please don't let him know anything about death." And the king </div>
<div id="tm_38" class="t s1_38">made all the arrangements. He made three palaces for Siddhartha for different seasons </div>
<div id="tn_38" class="t s1_38">in different places, so that he never came to know the discomfort of the season. When it </div>
<div id="to_38" class="t s1_38">was hot he had a palace in a certain place in the hills where it was always cool. When it </div>
<div id="tp_38" class="t s1_38">was too cold he had another palace by the side of a river where it was always warm. He </div>
<div id="tq_38" class="t s1_38">made all the arrangements so he never felt any discomfort. </div>
<div id="tr_38" class="t s1_38">No old man or woman was allowed to enter the palaces where he lived -- only young </div>
<div id="ts_38" class="t s1_38">people. He gathered all the beautiful young women of the kingdom around him so he </div>
<div id="tt_38" class="t s1_38">would remain allured, fascinated, so he would remain in dreams, desires. A sweet </div>
<div id="tu_38" class="t s1_38">dreamworld was created for him. The gardeners were told that dead leaves had to be </div>
<div id="tv_38" class="t s1_38">removed in the night; fading, withering flowers had to be removed in the night -- </div>
<div id="tw_38" class="t s1_38">because who knows? -- seeing a dead leaf he might start asking about what has </div>
<div id="tx_38" class="t s1_38">happened to this leaf, and the question of death may arise. Seeing a withering rose, </div>
<div id="ty_38" class="t s1_38">petals falling, he might ask, "What has happened to this rose?" and he might start </div>
<div id="tz_38" class="t s1_38">brooding, meditating, about death. </div>
<div id="t10_38" class="t s1_38">He was kept absolutely unaware of death for twenty-nine years. But how long can you </div>
<div id="t11_38" class="t s1_38">avoid? Death is such an important phenomenon -- how long can you deceive? Sooner or </div>
<div id="t12_38" class="t s1_38">later he had to enter into the world. Now the king was getting very old and the son had </div>
<div id="t13_38" class="t s1_38">to know the ways of the world, so slowly slowly he was allowed, but whenever he </div>
<div id="t14_38" class="t s1_38">would pass through any street of the capital, old men, old women, would be removed, </div>
<div id="t15_38" class="t s1_38">beggars would be removed. No sannyasin was allowed to cross while he was passing, </div>
<div id="t16_38" class="t s1_38">because seeing a sannyasin he might ask "What type of man is this? Why is he in </div>
<div id="t17_38" class="t s1_38">orange? What has happened to him? Why does he look different, detached, distant? His </div>
