<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">difference: a buddha is a watcher. It hurts, but it does not hurt HIM. He watches as if it </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">is happening to somebody else. He feels compassion for the body -- he feels </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">compassion, his compassion for his body -- but he knows that he is not the body. </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">So, in a way, it hurts him more than it hurts to you, in another way it hurts not at all. He </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">remains aloof, unconcerned. It is a very paradoxical state. He CARES for the body, but </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">yet remains unconcerned -- unconcerned about the consequences. He takes every </div>

<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">good house to live in -- he takes care but he remains aloof. </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">Even when the body is dying a buddha goes on watching that the body is dying. His </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">watchfulness remains to the very last. The body dies and the buddha goes on watching </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">that the body has died. If one can watch to such an extent, one goes beyond death. </div>

<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">matter. The buddha cannot ask for them for himself or for another. That distinction has </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">to be remembered. Ordinarily it is thought that a buddha will not ask for himself, but </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">he can ask for others. No, he will not ask for others either. That's where Christianity and </div>

<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">People had told her that if she goes to the Buddha, he is such a compassionate man, he </div>

<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">- bring some mustard seeds. One condition has to be fulfilled: they should be brought </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">from a house where nobody has ever died." </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">The woman was very happy; this was not a problem because their whole village was </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">growing mustard seeds. So every house was full of mustard seeds. She rushed from one </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">house to another, but in her excitement that her son is going to be revived again she </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">forgot completely that the condition is impossible, it cannot be fulfilled. </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">By the evening she had knocked on all the doors, and everybody said, "We can give you </div>
