<div id="t2_84" class="t s1_84">impossible. And they have talked such nonsense for so long that you don't even </div>
<div id="t3_84" class="t s1_84">understand how contradictory they are. Then the whole humanity goes on </div>
<div id="t4_84" class="t s1_84">moving in darkness. </div>
<div id="t5_84" class="t s1_84">Remember one thing: Christ is not a politician -- not even of love -- because </div>
<div id="t6_84" class="t s1_84">politics is poisonous. It will poison love itself. </div>
<div id="t7_84" class="t s1_84">Christ is not a politician at all. I lad he been a politician, he would not have been </div>
<div id="t8_84" class="t s1_84">crucified. Just a little diplomacy would have saved him. Just a little diplomacy: </div>
<div id="t9_84" class="t s1_84">there was nothing much in it. But he was not a politician. That was the trouble. </div>
<div id="ta_84" class="t s1_84">He was very authentic and true, not diplomatic. He said whatsoever he felt. </div>
<div id="tb_84" class="t s1_84">Look: your so-called mahatmas are politicians. They try to live according to their </div>
<div id="tc_84" class="t s1_84">principles, they try to BE according to their ideology. Whatsoever they preach, </div>
<div id="td_84" class="t s1_84">they try to live it. </div>
<div id="te_84" class="t s1_84">Jesus is totally different. Whatsoever he lives, he preaches. There is the </div>
<div id="tf_84" class="t s1_84">difference. A Mahatma Gandhi looks almost like Jesus. He's not. He tries to live </div>
<div id="tg_84" class="t s1_84">whatsoever he preaches, but the preaching is important. He wants others also to </div>
<div id="th_84" class="t s1_84">live according to his preaching. and he himself tries to live according to his </div>
<div id="ti_84" class="t s1_84">preaching. </div>
<div id="tj_84" class="t s1_84">Jesus is totally different. He says and preaches whatsoever he lives. When you </div>
<div id="tk_84" class="t s1_84">preach whatsoever you live, you are exposed. You are open and vulnerable. You </div>
<div id="tl_84" class="t s1_84">are true to yourself, but then you start becoming unfit with the society. Society is </div>
<div id="tm_84" class="t s1_84">politics, it is diplomacy. Many things are not to be said, many things have to be </div>
<div id="tn_84" class="t s1_84">said which are not true. </div>
<div id="to_84" class="t s1_84">When Pontius Pilate asked Jesus, "What is truth?" Jesus remained silent. He </div>
<div id="tp_84" class="t s1_84">could have said something, he was an articulate man. He was a great poet in his </div>
<div id="tq_84" class="t s1_84">utterances, he could have said something. And his whole life was depending on </div>
<div id="tr_84" class="t s1_84">that. That was the last thing Pilate asked: "What is truth?" Jesus looked into his </div>
<div id="ts_84" class="t s1_84">eyes and remained silent. Very undiplomatic, very nonpolitical. He embarrassed </div>
<div id="tt_84" class="t s1_84">Pilate. </div>
<div id="tu_84" class="t s1_84">In that silence, Pilate felt very restless and uncomfortable. Jesus penetrated him </div>
<div id="tv_84" class="t s1_84">deeply. His silence was something that he was saying from his heart. </div>
<div id="tw_84" class="t s1_84">But Pilate wanted words. Pilate was not asking, "Show me the truth!" He was </div>
<div id="tx_84" class="t s1_84">asking, "What is truth? " He was asking for a definition. Jesus wouldn't give the </div>
<div id="ty_84" class="t s1_84">definition because HE was truth -- and he was standing in front of him! </div>
<div id="tz_84" class="t s1_84">He looked into his eyes. He must have stirred his soul. Pilate became uneasy. He </div>
<div id="t10_84" class="t s1_84">turned away from Jesus. He said to the priest, "Take this man away and do </div>
<div id="t11_84" class="t s1_84">whatsoever you like. Crucify him." </div>
<div id="t12_84" class="t s1_84">I always think about it. In that moment, Pilate must have felt as if he was being </div>
<div id="t13_84" class="t s1_84">crucified in silence. Just think about Jesus looking at you. All your falseness, all </div>
<div id="t14_84" class="t s1_84">your masks, fall away because they cannot be there when Jesus looks at you. </div>
<div id="t15_84" class="t s1_84">Naked and nude you stand before him. Empty, with nothing. </div>
<div id="t16_84" class="t s1_84">Pilate was the governor-general of the Roman Empire. But inside, a poor man, a </div>
<div id="t17_84" class="t s1_84">beggar. All that falseness cannot deceive Jesus; he penetrates deeply. All your </div>
