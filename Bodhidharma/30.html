<div id="t1_30" class="t s1_30">And the third word is UPADHYAY which goes a little more deeper into </div>
<div id="t2_30" class="t s1_30">experience. This teacher's information is more alive than the previous two. He </div>
<div id="t3_30" class="t s1_30">has traveled the path, but he has not reached the goal. </div>
<div id="t4_30" class="t s1_30">And then finally the ACHARYA, who has reached the goal, and the information </div>
<div id="t5_30" class="t s1_30">that he imparts is his own experience. He is his own authority, his own </div>
<div id="t6_30" class="t s1_30">argument; his own presence is the whole evidence. </div>
<div id="t7_30" class="t s1_30">But in English there is only one word, teacher, which is used for all kinds of </div>
<div id="t8_30" class="t s1_30">people. The other word is master, which is not used very much by the English </div>
<div id="t9_30" class="t s1_30">speaking people themselves. But I would like to use the word master, equivalent </div>
<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">to the word acharya: One who knows, not only through mind, but through </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">experience. </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">Most of the sutras in this part are unpolluted. The disciple has simply noted </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">them down as Bodhidharma must have spoken them. </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BY YOURSELF, YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND A </div>
<div id="tf_30" class="t s1_30">TEACHER. </div>
<div id="tg_30" class="t s1_30">Instead of teacher, the word master would be right because a teacher is one who </div>
<div id="th_30" class="t s1_30">teaches you about things of the outside world. Even if he teaches about the inner </div>
<div id="ti_30" class="t s1_30">experiences, it is borrowed. He may be knowledgeable but he is not knowledge </div>
<div id="tj_30" class="t s1_30">itself. To make the distinction, the translator has made the point in a different </div>
<div id="tk_30" class="t s1_30">way. </div>
<div id="tl_30" class="t s1_30">IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BY YOURSELF, YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND A </div>
<div id="tm_30" class="t s1_30">TEACHER TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF LIFE AND DEATH. BUT UNLESS </div>
<div id="tn_30" class="t s1_30">HE SEES HIS NATURE, SUCH A PERSON IS NOT A TEACHER. </div>
<div id="to_30" class="t s1_30">It is better to call a man who has reached to the highest peaks of experience a </div>
<div id="tp_30" class="t s1_30">master, and leave the word teacher for those who impart knowledge from one </div>
<div id="tq_30" class="t s1_30">generation to another. And master, also has a dignity of its own. </div>
<div id="tr_30" class="t s1_30">The teacher is almost like a computer. He has read, he has studied, he may have </div>
<div id="ts_30" class="t s1_30">crammed all scriptures but his presence does not indicate that he knows </div>
<div id="tt_30" class="t s1_30">anything. His actions are not arguments for what he says. His sayings come only </div>
<div id="tu_30" class="t s1_30">from the superficial layer of the mind; they are not coming from the innermost </div>
<div id="tv_30" class="t s1_30">core of his being. The teacher cannot teach without words. But the master, on the </div>
<div id="tw_30" class="t s1_30">contrary, cannot teach without silences. If he uses words, it is only to create </div>
<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">silence. </div>
<div id="ty_30" class="t s1_30">The master is a living example of what he is saying. The teacher simply shows a </div>
<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">very well-versed, educated mind. The master shows a transformed being, a </div>
<div id="t10_30" class="t s1_30">luminous presence. Anybody who has eyes can see it ...his grace, his beauty, his </div>
<div id="t11_30" class="t s1_30">blissfulness, his laughter; even in his silence much is said, without words. Even </div>
<div id="t12_30" class="t s1_30">his silence is a song of the ultimate; even unmoving, he is a dance expressing the </div>
<div id="t13_30" class="t s1_30">dance of the whole universe. The master is so far away from the teacher that it is </div>
<div id="t14_30" class="t s1_30">better to use the word separately. </div>
<div id="t15_30" class="t s1_30">I would prefer to say: If you don't understand by yourself, you will have to get a </div>
<div id="t16_30" class="t s1_30">master, because the master knows his own nature. And by knowing his own </div>
<div id="t17_30" class="t s1_30">nature, he also knows the nature of every living being because it is the SAME </div>
