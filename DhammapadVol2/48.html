<div id="t2_48" class="t s1_48">have it...ask them: they are tired of being famous, they are utterly tired of being famous. </div>
<div id="t3_48" class="t s1_48">They want to be anonymous. They want to be nobodies. </div>
<div id="t4_48" class="t s1_48">Voltaire has written in his memoirs that when he was not famous his only desire was to </div>
<div id="t5_48" class="t s1_48">be famous; he was ready to sacrifice everything for fame. And if you go on searching for </div>
<div id="t6_48" class="t s1_48">a certain thing, you are bound to get it, remember. One day he became famous, and </div>
<div id="t7_48" class="t s1_48">then he wrote, "I was so tired of my fame, because all privacy in my life disappeared, all </div>
<div id="t8_48" class="t s1_48">intimate relationships disappeared -- I was so famous that I always was crowded by </div>
<div id="t9_48" class="t s1_48">people, everywhere, wherever I would go. If I went for a stroll in the garden, then a </div>
<div id="ta_48" class="t s1_48">crowd would follow. I was almost like a showpiece, a kind of walking circus." </div>
<div id="tb_48" class="t s1_48">His fame reached such peaks that it became dangerous for his life. Once when he was </div>
<div id="tc_48" class="t s1_48">coming from the station to his house after a journey, he reached home almost naked, </div>
<div id="td_48" class="t s1_48">scratched all over the body, blood oozing from many places -- because in France in </div>
<div id="te_48" class="t s1_48">those days this was the superstition, that if you can get a piece of the clothes of a </div>
<div id="tf_48" class="t s1_48">famous man you can also become famous. So people tore his clothes, and in tearing his </div>
<div id="tg_48" class="t s1_48">clothes, they scratched his body. </div>
<div id="th_48" class="t s1_48">He cried and wept that day, and said, "How foolish I was that I wanted to be famous. </div>
<div id="ti_48" class="t s1_48">How beautiful it was when nobody knew me and I was a free man. Now I am no longer </div>
<div id="tj_48" class="t s1_48">a free man." </div>
<div id="tk_48" class="t s1_48">Then he wanted to be a nobody. And it happened too that the fame disappeared. In this </div>

<div id="tn_48" class="t s1_48">his dog -- so only three really. People had completely forgotten about him, they had </div>
<div id="to_48" class="t s1_48">forgotten that he was alive. They came to know only when the newspapers published </div>
<div id="tp_48" class="t s1_48">the report that Voltaire had died. Then people became aware and started asking each </div>
<div id="tq_48" class="t s1_48">other, "Was he still alive?" </div>
<div id="tr_48" class="t s1_48">If you have fame, you get tired of it. If you have money, you will not know what to do </div>
<div id="ts_48" class="t s1_48">with it. If you are respected by people, you become a slave, because then you have to go </div>
<div id="tt_48" class="t s1_48">on fulfilling their expectations; otherwise your respectability will disappear. Only when </div>
<div id="tu_48" class="t s1_48">you are not famous do you think it is something significant. When you are not </div>
