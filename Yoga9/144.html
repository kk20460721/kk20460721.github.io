<div id="t1_144" class="t s1_144">When you repress something, you have to be constantly alert, constantly repressing it. </div>
<div id="t2_144" class="t s1_144">Repressing is not something that you have done once and for all. It has to be done every </div>
<div id="t3_144" class="t s1_144">moment of your life. If you don't do it, those things that you have repressed will surface. </div>
<div id="t4_144" class="t s1_144">You have to be constantly sitting on their chest, holding them there. If you leave them </div>
<div id="t5_144" class="t s1_144">even for a single moment, the enemy will be up and again there will be the same struggle </div>
<div id="t6_144" class="t s1_144">and the same fight. </div>
<div id="t7_144" class="t s1_144">That's why your saints cannot take any holiday. Impossible. How can you take a holiday, </div>
<div id="t8_144" class="t s1_144">because the holiday will disturb everything? Your saint has to be constantly on guard. </div>
<div id="t9_144" class="t s1_144">That's the tension. Constantly alert. A woman is coming: shrink your energy </div>
<div id="ta_144" class="t s1_144">continuously, hold it there, let the woman pass. But they are passing continuously. Or if </div>
<div id="tb_144" class="t s1_144">they are not passing, then it is something else and something else. The whole of life is </div>
<div id="tc_144" class="t s1_144">sexual. </div>
<div id="td_144" class="t s1_144">If you somehow avoid women and escape to the Himalayas, birds will be there making </div>
<div id="te_144" class="t s1_144">love to each other.What will you do? Animals will come and disturb you. The whole of </div>
<div id="tf_144" class="t s1_144">life is sexual; you cannot escape anywhere. The whole ocean is of sexual energy. </div>
<div id="tg_144" class="t s1_144">And nothing wrong in it. It is beautifully so. </div>
<div id="th_144" class="t s1_144">God has manifested in the world as sex. If you go to the old scriptures you will find it so -</div>
<div id="ti_144" class="t s1_144">- particularly in Hindu scriptures.Why did God create the world? Hindu scriptures say, </div>
<div id="tj_144" class="t s1_144">"Because desire arose in him -- sex arose in him -- he created the world." All creation is </div>
<div id="tk_144" class="t s1_144">out of sexual energy, desire -- kama. But Hindus have been in a way very courageous. </div>
<div id="tl_144" class="t s1_144">They say God created the world; then he started creating animals, trees. How did he </div>
<div id="tm_144" class="t s1_144">create so many trees? How did he create so many animals? What was his plan, blueprint? </div>
<div id="tn_144" class="t s1_144">How did he start working on such a complex world? Hindus say it is very simple. First he </div>
<div id="to_144" class="t s1_144">created a cow</div>
<div id="tp_144" class="t s1_144">....</div>
<div id="tq_144" class="t s1_144">Hindus love the cow, so of course God has to create the cow first. And </div>
<div id="tr_144" class="t s1_144">the cow looks so divine, so silent and graceful. He created the cow, and then he fell in </div>
<div id="ts_144" class="t s1_144">love with the cow. No other religion is so daring -- the father falling in love with the </div>
<div id="tt_144" class="t s1_144">daughter. The cow is his daughter; he has created it. He fell in love; now what to do? He </div>
<div id="tu_144" class="t s1_144">was in a mess himself. So he became a bull because that is the only way to love a cow; </div>
<div id="tv_144" class="t s1_144">otherwise how will you love? To escape from that -- as women are always escaping</div>
<div id="tw_144" class="t s1_144">....</div>
<div id="tx_144" class="t s1_144">Female energy escapes. That is the game. Not really that a woman wants to escape; she </div>
<div id="ty_144" class="t s1_144">plays the game of escaping. Hmm?... if a man approaches the woman and she simply is </div>
<div id="tz_144" class="t s1_144">ready to go to bed with him, the man will start feeling a little worried. W12at is wrong </div>
<div id="t10_144" class="t s1_144">with the woman? Because the game was not played. The whole beauty of love is not so </div>
<div id="t11_144" class="t s1_144">much in the love as in the foreplay. You make so many efforts -- the courtship? But the </div>
<div id="t12_144" class="t s1_144">courtship is possible only if the woman is receding. Just see. Whenever you are talking to </div>
<div id="t13_144" class="t s1_144">a woman, if you are interested in her, she will be moving back and you will be moving </div>
<div id="t14_144" class="t s1_144">forward. But there is always a wall, so the woman goes against the wall; then she is </div>
<div id="t15_144" class="t s1_144">caught. She always moves towards the wall -- that too is intentional! It is all intentional. </div>
<div id="t16_144" class="t s1_144">It is the whole game, and a beautiful game. </div>
<div id="t17_144" class="t s1_144">So the cow started running to escape from the bull. She became a tigress. Then God has </div>
<div id="t18_144" class="t s1_144">to become a tiger. She became a lioness -- just to escape. God has to become a lion. And </div>
<div id="t19_144" class="t s1_144">that's how the whole world was created: the woman escaping; the man chasing. A </div>
<div id="t1a_144" class="t s1_144">beautiful story, and very true. </div>
<div id="t1b_144" class="t s1_144">That's how the whole world has been created: one energy escaping; another chasing. </div>
<div id="t1c_144" class="t s1_144">Hide-and-seek -- the woman hiding and hiding and hiding -- and the beauty of it -- and </div>
<div id="t1d_144" class="t s1_144">God finding her again and again, and she again hiding, and God finding her again -- in </div>
