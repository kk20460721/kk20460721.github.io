<div id="t1_78" class="t s1_78">CHAPTER 4. RELIGION HAS NO HISTORY, IT IS ETERNAL</div>
<div id="t2_78" class="t s2_78">The idea of non-violence could only take root in a soil deeply steeped in violence.</div>
<div id="t3_78" class="t s2_78">People who</div>
<div id="t4_78" class="t s2_78">had lived with violence for generations were the right vehicles for non-violence, and the kshatriyas</div>
<div id="t5_78" class="t s2_78">became the vehicle.</div>
<div id="t6_78" class="t s2_78">Krishna could not have persuaded Mahavira to take to violence, because Mahavira did not say he</div>
<div id="t7_78" class="t s2_78">would not kill his family and relatives, he was not grieving for them. In fact, he had renounced them,</div>
<div id="t8_78" class="t s2_78">he had renounced the whole world of relationships.</div>
<div id="t9_78" class="t s2_78">His stand was altogether different: he had</div>
<div id="ta_78" class="t s2_78">totally denied violence as inhuman and meaningless. He would have said, ”Violence is irreligious.”</div>
<div id="tb_78" class="t s2_78">If Krishna had argued with him that, ”It is better to die in one’s own nature,” he would simply have</div>
<div id="tc_78" class="t s2_78">said, ”Not to kill is my self-nature; I would die before killing.” He would have told Krishna, ”Don’t tell</div>
<div id="td_78" class="t s2_78">me to kill. Killing is alien to me.” If the Geeta had been preached to Mahavira, he would simply have</div>
<div id="te_78" class="t s2_78">stepped out of Krishna’s chariot, said goodbye and retired to the forest. The Geeta would not have</div>
<div id="tf_78" class="t s2_78">cut any ice with Mahavira.</div>
<div id="tg_78" class="t s2_78">But the Geeta had appeal for Arjuna; he was impressed and changed by it. The Geeta appealed</div>
<div id="th_78" class="t s2_78">to him not because Krishna succeeded with him, it changed his mind because he was intrinsically</div>
<div id="ti_78" class="t s2_78">a warrior, because ﬁghting was in his blood and bones. And all his distractions from war and its</div>
<div id="tj_78" class="t s2_78">attendant violence, and his grief and sorrow, were passing reactions caused by his deep clannish</div>
<div id="tk_78" class="t s2_78">attachments.</div>
<div id="tl_78" class="t s2_78">So Krishna succeeded in dispelling those patches of clouds that had temporarily covered the sky</div>
<div id="tm_78" class="t s2_78">of his mind. Those clouds did not represent his real mind, they did not make up his sky. If it were</div>
<div id="tn_78" class="t s2_78">his real sky, Krishna would not have tried to change it. This would be out of the question. Then the</div>
<div id="to_78" class="t s2_78">GEETA would not have been delivered at all. Krishna would have known it was Arjuna’s own sky,</div>
<div id="tp_78" class="t s2_78">his own self-nature. But the sky does not come so suddenly.</div>
<div id="tq_78" class="t s2_78">Arjuna’s entire life bears witness to the fact that his real sky is that of a warrior, and not of a brahmin.</div>
<div id="tr_78" class="t s2_78">And his deviations are like transient clouds in the sky, which Krishna seeks to dispel. If it is his true</div>
<div id="ts_78" class="t s2_78">nature there is no reason for Arjuna to move from it. This is precisely what Krishna tells him, ”It is</div>
<div id="tt_78" class="t s2_78">better to die in one’s own nature than to live in any alien nature.”</div>
<div id="tu_78" class="t s2_78">And had Arjuna this much to say, ”This is my true nature, that it would be better to die than to kill</div>
<div id="tv_78" class="t s2_78">others. Forgive me, I am walking out on the battle. ”</div>
<div id="tw_78" class="t s2_78">The story would have ended right there. Krishna does not ask him to take on an alien nature; on the</div>
<div id="tx_78" class="t s2_78">contrary, he insists over and over again on his knowing his true nature and remaining steadfast in it.</div>
<div id="ty_78" class="t s2_78">Krishna’s entire effort, running through the whole of the GEETA, is directed towards making Arjuna</div>
<div id="tz_78" class="t s2_78">realize his self-nature. He has no wish whatsoever to impose anything alien on him.</div>
<div id="t10_78" class="t s2_78">The other part of your question also deserves consideration.</div>
<div id="t11_78" class="t s2_78">Of course, I said that Krishna is not a Master, that he is a friend to Arjuna, but I did not say that Arjuna</div>
<div id="t12_78" class="t s2_78">is not a disciple. I did not say that. Arjuna can well be a disciple, and this will be a relationship from</div>
<div id="t13_78" class="t s2_78">Arjuna’s side. He, on his side, can submit to being a disciple – which has nothing to do with Krishna</div>
<div id="t14_78" class="t s2_78">who, nevertheless, remains a friend. And Arjuna is really a disciple; he wants to learn. To be a</div>
<div id="t15_78" class="t s2_78">disciple means a readiness to learn. Therefore a disciple asks questions. Arjuna asks questions,</div>
<div id="t16_78" class="t s2_78">inquires, because he wants to learn.</div>
<div id="t17_78" class="t s2_78">Krishna: The Man and His Philosophy</div>
<div id="t18_78" class="t s2_78">78</div>
<div id="t19_78" class="t s3_78">Osho</div>
