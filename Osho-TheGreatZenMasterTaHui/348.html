<div id="t1_348" class="t s1_348">Don't live in installments: that is the meaning of being thoroughgoing. It means don't be</div>
<div id="t2_348" class="t s1_348">American! Don't live in installments; live totally now, as if tomorrow does not exist. In fact it</div>
<div id="t3_348" class="t s1_348">does not exist; it is only our idea, it is our laziness. It is our reluctance to put ourself totally at</div>
<div id="t4_348" class="t s1_348">risk, now. We say, "What is the hurry?" -- we find a thousand and one excuses for postponing,</div>
<div id="t5_348" class="t s1_348">particularly the great affair.</div>
<div id="t6_348" class="t s1_348">Gautam Buddha was dying and a man came running. Buddha had passed by his village</div>
<div id="t7_348" class="t s1_348">thirty times in his forty-two years of wandering; his village was kind of a crossroad. Buddha</div>
<div id="t8_348" class="t s1_348">had passed by the side of his house and had stayed outside the village thirty times -- and this</div>
<div id="t9_348" class="t s1_348">man had always postponed. He wanted to see Buddha, he had heard so much about him, but</div>
<div id="ta_348" class="t s1_348">always small excuses ... a customer has come, and he is tending his shop; his wife is sick and</div>
<div id="tb_348" class="t s1_348">he has to go to the physician, or something else.</div>
<div id="tc_348" class="t s1_348">But suddenly one day he heard that Gautam Buddha was outside his village and had told</div>
<div id="td_348" class="t s1_348">his disciples that now he is going to leave his body: "If you have anything to ask, you can ask.</div>
<div id="te_348" class="t s1_348">It should not be said by the coming generations that Buddha did not answer a question which</div>
<div id="tf_348" class="t s1_348">was in the mind of one of his disciples. For forty-two years I have been answering you, but</div>
<div id="tg_348" class="t s1_348">perhaps there may be some questions still. Before I leave the body, I want to answer them all."</div>
<div id="th_348" class="t s1_348">The disciples said with tears in their eyes, "You have answered more than we had ever</div>
<div id="ti_348" class="t s1_348">asked, or ever thought to ask. We don't want to disturb you. You can silently leave your body.</div>
<div id="tj_348" class="t s1_348">This is no moment for any question or answer; this is no moment for any communication with</div>
<div id="tk_348" class="t s1_348">language. We simply want to be silent, watching your disappearance into the universal</div>
<div id="tl_348" class="t s1_348">consciousness."</div>
<div id="tm_348" class="t s1_348">Three times he asked -- that was his routine ... Many times he was asked, "Why do you ask</div>
<div id="tn_348" class="t s1_348">three times?" He said, "Even three times are not enough, people are so deaf." He again said, "I</div>
<div id="to_348" class="t s1_348">still ask; if anybody has any question, don't hide, don't be shy" -- but again and again they said</div>
<div id="tp_348" class="t s1_348">they didn't have any question.</div>
<div id="tq_348" class="t s1_348">So Buddha said, "Then I shall enter into the four stages: The first stage of meditation, in</div>
<div id="tr_348" class="t s1_348">which one leaves the body; the second stage, in which one leaves the mind; the third stage, in</div>
<div id="ts_348" class="t s1_348">which one leaves the heart; and the fourth stage, in which one leaves the very self and the</div>
<div id="tt_348" class="t s1_348">dewdrop disappears into the ocean."</div>
<div id="tu_348" class="t s1_348">So he closed his eyes ... Just then this man from the village came running, saying "I have a</div>
<div id="tv_348" class="t s1_348">few questions!"</div>
<div id="tw_348" class="t s1_348">People said, "Don't be stupid. Thirty times Buddha has been near your town, and where</div>
<div id="tx_348" class="t s1_348">have you been?"</div>
<div id="ty_348" class="t s1_348">He said, "Sometimes there was a customer, sometimes there was a guest, sometimes my</div>
<div id="tz_348" class="t s1_348">wife was sick, sometimes I was engaged in fighting with someone -- just trivia, I know. It was</div>
<div id="t10_348" class="t s1_348">stupid of me to postpone, but hearing that Buddha is leaving the body, now I cannot</div>
<div id="t11_348" class="t s1_348">postpone."</div>
<div id="t12_348" class="t s1_348">But Ananda, Buddha's chief disciple said, "Now be silent. He has already moved inwards.</div>
<div id="t13_348" class="t s1_348">He has closed his eyes, and it is absolutely ungentlemanly ... now wait for some other life.</div>
<div id="t14_348" class="t s1_348">When you find some other buddha, then you can ask your questions. And your questions are</div>
<div id="t15_348" class="t s1_348">not very important either, because if you can postpone them for thirty years they cannot mean</div>
<div id="t16_348" class="t s1_348">much. They are not a priority in your life."</div>
<div id="t17_348" class="t s1_348">When the meaning, the significance of life becomes a priority, everything else becomes</div>
<div id="t18_348" class="t s1_348">secondary: you have entered the great affair.</div>
<div id="t19_348" class="t s1_348">Chapter 30 - Be thorough going</div>
<div id="t1a_348" class="t s1_348">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1b_348" class="t s1_348">348</div>
