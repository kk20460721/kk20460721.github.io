<div id="t1_11" class="t s1_11">So he had his appendix out. Presently he went to another doctor claiming that he still </div>
<div id="t2_11" class="t s1_11">had the same trouble, so he was put on a course of tranquilizers. This did not help and </div>
<div id="t3_11" class="t s1_11">he went to a hospital where they prescribed him a diet and remedial exercises. </div>
<div id="t4_11" class="t s1_11">Some weeks later he had to go to another surgeon because those medicines were not </div>
<div id="t5_11" class="t s1_11">helping at all. The surgeon said, "Your tonsils have to be removed..." so the tonsils were </div>
<div id="t6_11" class="t s1_11">removed. And this way he went on going from one doctor to another, from one surgeon </div>
<div id="t7_11" class="t s1_11">to another, and parts of the body were slowly slowly disappearing. But the problem </div>
<div id="t8_11" class="t s1_11">remained the same! </div>
<div id="t9_11" class="t s1_11">Then one day he was strolling in the marketplace and one of the doctors saw him. He </div>
<div id="ta_11" class="t s1_11">said, "Glad to see you -- you look better! You look perfect!" said the physician. "How </div>
<div id="tb_11" class="t s1_11">did it happen? Who helped you finally? -- because we had all failed. Was it my service </div>
<div id="tc_11" class="t s1_11">that helped you?" </div>
<div id="td_11" class="t s1_11">"Service my eye!" said the patient. "Both the pain and the limp went away the moment I </div>
<div id="te_11" class="t s1_11">took that nail out of my shoe!" </div>
<div id="tf_11" class="t s1_11">Sometimes things are very small, but if you go to knowledgeable people they look with </div>
<div id="tg_11" class="t s1_11">magnifying glasses; they magnify everything. They are clever and efficient in creating </div>
<div id="th_11" class="t s1_11">problems, because they know the solutions. Their solutions are useful only if they create </div>
<div id="ti_11" class="t s1_11">problems. </div>
<div id="tj_11" class="t s1_11">Go to any expert, and immediately he will tell you so many problems that you were </div>
<div id="tk_11" class="t s1_11">never aware of. He has to, because his whole expertise depends on your having many </div>
<div id="tl_11" class="t s1_11">problems, and the more complicated they are, the more happy he is because now he has </div>
<div id="tm_11" class="t s1_11">an opportunity to show his knowledge, his skill. </div>
<div id="tn_11" class="t s1_11">The real problem may be very small. The real problem is REALLY small! The problem is </div>
<div id="to_11" class="t s1_11">that you live in the head. Come down from the head to the heart. The head can become </div>
<div id="tp_11" class="t s1_11">knowledgeable, the heart can never become knowledgeable. The heart can become wise. </div>
<div id="tq_11" class="t s1_11">The heart knows in a totally different way. Its knowing is direct, immediate -- it is not </div>
<div id="tr_11" class="t s1_11">logical, it is intuitive. It is not inference, it is not a conclusion after a long </div>
<div id="ts_11" class="t s1_11">argumentation. It is a simple vision! One simply knows</div>
<div id="tt_11" class="t s1_11">....</div>
<div id="tu_11" class="t s1_11">The heart is not a process of knowing: it is the opening of an eye. </div>
<div id="tv_11" class="t s1_11">LET HIM CHASTEN AND TEACH YOU </div>
<div id="tw_11" class="t s1_11">AND KEEP YOU FROM MISCHIEF. </div>
<div id="tx_11" class="t s1_11">The mind is mischievous. It goes on befooling you; it plays so many mischiefs upon you </div>
<div id="ty_11" class="t s1_11">that you are not aware of. The first mischief is: the wise man shares his wisdom and you </div>
<div id="tz_11" class="t s1_11">immediately jump upon it and reduce it into knowledge. The second mischief is: the </div>
<div id="t10_11" class="t s1_11">wise man helps you to be yourself and you start hard work in imitating the wise man -- </div>
<div id="t11_11" class="t s1_11">you try to be like him. </div>
<div id="t12_11" class="t s1_11">The wise man wants you only to have insight into things so that you have your own </div>
<div id="t13_11" class="t s1_11">light. But you don't want insight, you want clear-cut instructions. You don't want to see </div>
<div id="t14_11" class="t s1_11">yourself, you want to be guided. You don't want to accept your responsibility towards </div>
<div id="t15_11" class="t s1_11">yourself; you want to throw the whole responsibility on the shoulders of the master, on </div>
