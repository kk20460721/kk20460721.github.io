<div id="t1_22" class="t s1_22">Buddha became enlightened under a tree, watching the last morning star disappearing </div>
<div id="t2_22" class="t s1_22">in the sky; not in a temple, not in a church -- under a tree, watching a star. Must have </div>
<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">become possessed. And the disappearing star, slowly slowly disappearing...going, </div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">going, gone. One moment before it was there, and now it is no longer there. And in that </div>
<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">moment, suddenly something in him, the last citadel of the ego, disappeared too. Just </div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">like the disappearing morning star, his ego disappeared too. </div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">The sky was empty, and he was empty. And whenever two things are empty, they </div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">become one -- because two empty things cannot be demarcated. By what will you </div>
<div id="t9_22" class="t s1_22">demarcate emptiness? Two nothings cannot be kept separate; two nothings become one </div>
<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">nothing. The star disappeared there, and the sky was empty, and the ego disappeared </div>
<div id="tb_22" class="t s1_22">inside and the sky was empty inside too...and suddenly the inner and the outer were </div>
<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">gone. It was only one sky. </div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">That moment Buddha became enlightened. That moment he came to know dhamma, </div>
<div id="te_22" class="t s1_22">the logos, the tao, God, the cosmic principle of life. </div>
<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">Mahavira became enlightened, not in a temple -- not even in a Jaina temple! There were </div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">Jaina temples in Mahavira's time. Mahavira was the twenty-fourth tirthankara of the </div>
<div id="th_22" class="t s1_22">Jainas -- the twenty-fourth great master. Twenty-three masters had preceded him. There </div>
<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">were Jaina temples, but he didn't become enlightened in a Jaina temple -- the Jainas </div>
<div id="tj_22" class="t s1_22">should note the fact. He became enlightened in the forest. Just sitting there, doing </div>
<div id="tk_22" class="t s1_22">nothing, and suddenly it came. It comes like a flood. </div>
<div id="tl_22" class="t s1_22">Mohammed became enlightened on a mountain. And so is the case with everybody: </div>
<div id="tm_22" class="t s1_22">Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, Kabir, Nanak...not a single person has ever become enlightened </div>
<div id="tn_22" class="t s1_22">in a temple, church or mosque. Why do you go there? </div>
<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">Go early in the morning to see the sunrise. Sit in the middle of the night watching the </div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">sky full of stars. Go, befriend trees and rocks. Go, lie down by the side of the river and </div>
<div id="tq_22" class="t s1_22">listen to its sound. And you will be coming closer and closer to the real temple of God. </div>
<div id="tr_22" class="t s1_22">Nature is his real temple. And there, be possessed -- don't try to possess. The effort to </div>
<div id="ts_22" class="t s1_22">possess is worldly; the desire to be possessed is divine. </div>
<div id="tt_22" class="t s1_22">Prashantam, next time it happens, don't try to do anything about it. No need to </div>
<div id="tu_22" class="t s1_22">understand, no need to observe, no need to examine, no need to analyze -- let it be </div>
<div id="tv_22" class="t s1_22">there! Be possessed by it! Dance it! Sing it! And be totally one with it. That is the only </div>
<div id="tw_22" class="t s1_22">way to know it. </div>
<div id="tx_22" class="t s1_22">You ask me, "It is about this feeling that it has always been there" -- the feeling is </div>
<div id="ty_22" class="t s1_22">absolutely true -- "and as soon as I feel it, it seems so far away." Because with the </div>
<div id="tz_22" class="t s1_22">feeling, the 'I' comes in -- and the 'I' is the distance between you and truth. The bigger </div>
<div id="t10_22" class="t s1_22">the 'I', the bigger the distance, the smaller the 'I', the smaller the distance. No 'I', no </div>
<div id="t11_22" class="t s1_22">distance. </div>
<div id="t12_22" class="t s1_22">And you ask me, "...but what is this 'it'?" </div>
<div id="t13_22" class="t s1_22">I cannot say it. It is now. Be possessed! It is here. Be possessed! It is not in my words but </div>
<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">in the gaps. It is not in my statements but in the intervals. Read it between the lines. </div>
<div id="t15_22" class="t s1_22">But remember one thing very very significant: that you have to be possessed by it to </div>
<div id="t16_22" class="t s1_22">understand it. And we are very much afraid of being possessed -- it seems as if we are </div>
