<div id="t1_21" class="t s1_21">I have heard a story. There was an atheist, and he was a lawyer, and a very </div>
<div id="t2_21" class="t s1_21">logical man. And to declare his faith he had written on his wall in big letters so </div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">whosoever would come would know -- he had written in big letters: GOD IS </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">NOWHERE. Then he became a father; a child was born to him. And the child </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">began learning words, and it was difficult for him to pronounce the big word </div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">"nowhere." So the child was reading -- he could read GOD IS, but he couldn't </div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s1_21">read NOWHERE; it was too big a word. So he broke it in two. He read, GOD IS </div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s1_21">NOW HERE. And I have heard that the father heard it and he was transformed. </div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">Suddenly, something melted in him: the child has brought a message. </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">So break the word in two; become a child. When I say "nowhere" try to hear </div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s1_21">"now here." Either you come from nowhere or you are born every moment now </div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s1_21">here. Moment to moment is birth. Moment to moment you die and disappear, </div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">and moment to moment you are born again. You are a process, not a thing: a </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">thing is born -- finished, then it dies. No, you are not a thing. You are not static. </div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">You are a process, riverlike, flowing. Every moment you are being renewed; </div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s1_21">every moment you are being resurrected. Every moment you die, and every </div>
<div id="th_21" class="t s1_21">moment you are reborn. </div>
<div id="ti_21" class="t s1_21">If you become aware of the present moment you will become aware of this </div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">phenomenon also: that every moment you move into the black hole, you </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">disappear, and again come anew out of it. Every moment this is happening, but </div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s1_21">you are not alert. That's why you miss. To see that interval, very intense alertness </div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s1_21">is needed. </div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s1_21">And then you will not ask the second part of the question: "... and how did we </div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s1_21">become?" You are always becoming. Becoming is your being. You are always </div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s1_21">growing, always and always, and there is no end to it. Don't think that there will </div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">come a time when you will become perfect and there will be no growth -- </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">because that will be death. There comes at no time such a moment. One goes on </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">transcending -- from one perfection to another perfection. </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">Go to the Himalayas. You see a peak and nothing else. Then you go to the peak </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">and suddenly other peaks come into your vision. Then go to other peaks, and </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">again many more peaks come into your vision. The more you grow, the more </div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">you see the possibility to grow. The more you become, the more doors open for </div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s1_21">your becoming -- new vistas, new avenues, new dimensions. </div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">Life is an ongoing phenomenon, a continuum. You never come to a point where </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">you can say, "Now I have become.'' And if you ask for such a moment, you are </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">asking for suicide. Don't ask that. Remain with the process. If you can remain </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">with the process it is so beautiful: to be born again and again, to be rejuvenated </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">again and again. If you ask that you would like to be perfect -- like a dead rock -- </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">then no becoming is needed. You are asking for death: you are not a love of life; </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">you have not lived and known life. </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">Live life, accept life, be alert to the passing moment, and all the mysteries will be </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">revealed to you by your own presence of awareness. There is no other way. </div>
