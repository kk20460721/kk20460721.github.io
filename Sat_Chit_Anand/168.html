<div id="t1_168" class="t s1_168">CHAPTER 15. THE IMPOSSIBLE IS ONLY AN IDEA OF THE MIND</div>
<div id="t2_168" class="t s2_168">It has also become very easy to take every day another girl, because the ﬁrst girl will never know</div>
<div id="t3_168" class="t s2_168">where you have gone. The car has managed a totally new world of love affairs. The inventors of the</div>
<div id="t4_168" class="t s2_168">car would have never thought about it, that it would change the whole structure of society.</div>
<div id="t5_168" class="t s2_168">In America the average person lives in one city for not more than three years, remains in one job not</div>
<div id="t6_168" class="t s2_168">more than three years, remains in one marriage not more than three years. Strange, but things are</div>
<div id="t7_168" class="t s2_168">changing so fast. When you change your job, it is not only the job that changes. You have to change</div>
<div id="t8_168" class="t s2_168">the city, the place you live in, the house. You become acquainted with new secretaries, new typists.</div>
<div id="t9_168" class="t s2_168">You were getting fed up with the old ones, but the new ones bring new life to you.</div>
<div id="ta_168" class="t s2_168">One of my attorneys was going to come this week and he informed me that, ”I am sorry. I will not be</div>
<div id="tb_168" class="t s2_168">able to come because my wife is divorcing me, so I am going through the process of divorce. And</div>
<div id="tc_168" class="t s2_168">I will end up almost a pauper, because she is a powerful woman. Everything is in her name – the</div>
<div id="td_168" class="t s2_168">house, the car – so once we are divorced, I am on the streets. She is going to take everything. And</div>
<div id="te_168" class="t s2_168">living with her has become so difﬁcult that I would prefer to be on the streets than continue living</div>
<div id="tf_168" class="t s2_168">with her. The person who is going to marry her I think of as my best friend, because he is taking the</div>
<div id="tg_168" class="t s2_168">whole responsibility, not realizing what is going to happen to him soon.”</div>
<div id="th_168" class="t s2_168">In the past people lived in one village their whole lives. Perhaps they went once in a while to the</div>
<div id="ti_168" class="t s2_168">nearby town or city. But even today in India there are millions of people who have not seen a railway</div>
<div id="tj_168" class="t s2_168">train, because they have never gone that far from their small village. They are perfectly satisﬁed</div>
<div id="tk_168" class="t s2_168">in their village. They are poor, but they don’t have the longing to go anywhere. They have a small</div>
<div id="tl_168" class="t s2_168">piece of land and they are too attached to it – they cannot leave it.</div>
<div id="tm_168" class="t s2_168">America is continuously on the move. It is the car that keeps people moving. When I was in America</div>
<div id="tn_168" class="t s2_168">I wanted to see it, but I could not see it. Five years I was there. And I inquired: ”I don’t see railway</div>
<div id="to_168" class="t s2_168">trains. I never come across railway crossings.” I was informed that most of the people are ﬂying. The</div>
<div id="tp_168" class="t s2_168">remaining ones who enjoy traveling use their cars. Trains are almost old-fashioned. It takes seven</div>
<div id="tq_168" class="t s2_168">days for the train to cross America. Who is going to waste seven days in a train? The distance can</div>
<div id="tr_168" class="t s2_168">be covered by plane within two hours. You can have your supper in London, your lunch in Bombay,</div>
<div id="ts_168" class="t s2_168">your coffee break in Tokyo, your supper in New York.</div>
<div id="tt_168" class="t s2_168">With this speed, there are bound to be many implications; old ties cannot remain. So people have</div>
<div id="tu_168" class="t s2_168">their girlfriends all around the world. It was not possible in the past to have a girlfriend if you were</div>
<div id="tv_168" class="t s2_168">married. Even if you were not married, then too it was not possible to have a girlfriend. It was against</div>
<div id="tw_168" class="t s2_168">the older generation’s morality. They never gave you the chance. Before you could even think of any</div>
<div id="tx_168" class="t s2_168">girl, you were married. Marriage came almost naturally. Just as you got your sister, your brother,</div>
<div id="ty_168" class="t s2_168">you got your wife. Before you became aware what was happening, you were already caught. There</div>
<div id="tz_168" class="t s2_168">was no question of choice.</div>
<div id="t10_168" class="t s2_168">And there is a certain human psychology. If you are living, for example, with your sisters, with your</div>
<div id="t11_168" class="t s2_168">brothers, you simply love them. Not that they are very beautiful or something unique. They are just</div>
<div id="t12_168" class="t s2_168">your sisters, they are your brothers, and you have lived so long together that a liking naturally arises.</div>
<div id="t13_168" class="t s2_168">In the past, love had no existence, it was only liking. You had lived together with your wife for years</div>
<div id="t14_168" class="t s2_168">before you could make love to her, and a certain liking ...</div>
<div id="t15_168" class="t s2_168">And there was no other alternative. So you were almost in chains. You could not have any friendship</div>
<div id="t16_168" class="t s2_168">with any woman. That was prohibited. Your only possible relationship was with your own wife, and</div>
<div id="t17_168" class="t s2_168">Sat Chit Anand</div>
<div id="t18_168" class="t s2_168">168</div>
