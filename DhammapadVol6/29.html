<div id="t1_29" class="t s1_29">disappear; if your respect for your parents was a reality, it will become more and more </div>
<div id="t2_29" class="t s1_29">profound. The work that you were doing -- if it was your heart's fulfillment, you will go </div>
<div id="t3_29" class="t s1_29">deeper into it. </div>
<div id="t4_29" class="t s1_29">A painter will become a greater painter, a musician will have new visions, a poet will </div>
<div id="t5_29" class="t s1_29">have new insights -- if the poet was really a poet, only then. If the poet was just playing </div>
<div id="t6_29" class="t s1_29">with arranging words and was writing poetry just to become famous and the poetry </div>
<div id="t7_29" class="t s1_29">was not his love affair, he was not ready to sacrifice his life for it, then poetry will </div>
<div id="t8_29" class="t s1_29">disappear. But it is not renouncing anything. You are not renouncing anything! A few </div>
<div id="t9_29" class="t s1_29">things are disappearing; a few other things will appear. </div>
<div id="ta_29" class="t s1_29">One thing is certain: after meditation, after MY sannyas, whatsoever happens is going </div>
<div id="tb_29" class="t s1_29">to give you more fulfillment, more maturity, more rootedness, more centering. It will </div>
<div id="tc_29" class="t s1_29">become a life which does not only grow old but also grows towards heights and depths. </div>
<div id="td_29" class="t s1_29">You will start living not only a horizontal life but a vertical life too. You will live on the </div>
<div id="te_29" class="t s1_29">horizontal as far as it is needed; otherwise ninety percent of your energies will start </div>
<div id="tf_29" class="t s1_29">moving in the vertical dimension, towards heights and depths. </div>
<div id="tg_29" class="t s1_29">Then this earth, this world, becomes only an opportunity to grow. And the man who is </div>
<div id="th_29" class="t s1_29">using the world, the earth, this life, as an opportunity to grow is on the right track. If </div>
<div id="ti_29" class="t s1_29">you not only grow in age but you also become grown-ups, then you have lived rightly. </div>
<div id="tj_29" class="t s1_29">And it is not renunciation: it is rejoicing, it is being grateful to God. </div>
<div id="tk_29" class="t s1_29">Your society, your parents, your teachers, your priests, your politicians, they have all </div>
<div id="tl_29" class="t s1_29">tried to impose something upon you, and you are carrying all that. But anything </div>
<div id="tm_29" class="t s1_29">imposed on you will remain a burden and you will be crushed under the weight of it, </div>
<div id="tn_29" class="t s1_29">and the weight will go on growing every day. </div>
<div id="to_29" class="t s1_29">The function of the master is to undo what the teachers, priests, parents and politicians </div>
<div id="tp_29" class="t s1_29">have done to you. Here I only make things clear to you. I don't impose any discipline. I </div>
<div id="tq_29" class="t s1_29">don't give you any character. I simply give you more consciousness, more light. Then </div>
<div id="tr_29" class="t s1_29">you have to find your character. Then you have to find your life-style, your life pattern. </div>
<div id="ts_29" class="t s1_29">I give you just a small candle; then you can find your path into the darkness of life. And </div>
<div id="tt_29" class="t s1_29">even a small candle is enough. If a little space around you becomes lighted and you can </div>
<div id="tu_29" class="t s1_29">take three, four steps in the light, that's enough; because by the time you have taken </div>
<div id="tv_29" class="t s1_29">four steps, the light goes four steps ahead of you. With a small candle one can pass </div>
<div id="tw_29" class="t s1_29">through ten thousand miles of darkness. </div>
<div id="tx_29" class="t s1_29">And I am not against life at all, as the old sannyas was. The old sannyas had a very </div>
<div id="ty_29" class="t s1_29">strange idea: that if you want to attain to God, you have to be anti-life -- as if God were </div>
<div id="tz_29" class="t s1_29">against life. If God was against life, life would not exist even for a single moment. Who </div>
<div id="t10_29" class="t s1_29">goes on nourishing life? Who goes on pouring energy into life? </div>
<div id="t11_29" class="t s1_29">The great Indian poet, Rabindranath, has said, "Whenever a child is born, I dance, I </div>
<div id="t12_29" class="t s1_29">rejoice. Why? Because a new child gives me an absolute certainty that God has not yet </div>
<div id="t13_29" class="t s1_29">become hopeless, that he still hopes. Each new child brings this certainty to the world, </div>
<div id="t14_29" class="t s1_29">that God is still interested in humanity, that he has not abandoned the project, that he </div>
<div id="t15_29" class="t s1_29">still hopes that buddhas will be born, that he still goes on creating new children, that he </div>
<div id="t16_29" class="t s1_29">is not tired, that his hope is infinite and his patience is infinite." </div>
