<div id="t4_47" class="t s1_47">We live surrounded by small things. We see only so far, just a little bit ahead, enough to </div>
<div id="t5_47" class="t s1_47">walk. Seven hundred years... that will make religion disappear from the earth, because </div>
<div id="t6_47" class="t s1_47">man is not so intelligent that he can be aware of death if death is postponed for seven </div>

<div id="ta_47" class="t s1_47">strange. I can't believe it. A man of seventy is still not interested in meditation? That </div>
<div id="tb_47" class="t s1_47">simply means he has not yet been able to see death, and death is very close. Any </div>

<div id="tg_47" class="t s1_47">It happened once: </div>
<div id="th_47" class="t s1_47">A sannyasin was sent by his master to the court of the great king, Janaka. The sannyasin </div>
<div id="ti_47" class="t s1_47">was a little puzzled; he said, "Why should I go to the court of the king?" </div>
<div id="tj_47" class="t s1_47">The master said, "You have to learn one thing, and you can learn it more easily there </div>
<div id="tk_47" class="t s1_47">than anywhere else; hence I am sending you. Go and watch and be very alert. You are </div>
<div id="tl_47" class="t s1_47">going to be enriched tremendously." </div>
<div id="tm_47" class="t s1_47">The sannyasin was not convinced. Remaining with such a great master, if he cannot </div>
<div id="tn_47" class="t s1_47">learn something, then how can he learn in the court of the king? He used to think the </div>
<div id="to_47" class="t s1_47">king a fool because he has so many possessions, such a big kingdom, and HE had </div>
<div id="tp_47" class="t s1_47">renounced all, so he had always thought himself holier than the king. Now, going to the </div>
<div id="tq_47" class="t s1_47">king to learn something he felt a little insulted. But when the master was saying it he </div>
<div id="tr_47" class="t s1_47">had to go. So he went, reluctantly, deep down resisting, but he went. </div>
<div id="ts_47" class="t s1_47">When he reached to the king's court he was shocked. In a way, his doubts were </div>
<div id="tt_47" class="t s1_47">confirmed. The king was sitting, drinking wine; beautiful women almost naked were </div>
<div id="tu_47" class="t s1_47">dancing around, and all the courtiers were there, completely drunk. The sannyasin </div>
<div id="tv_47" class="t s1_47">thought, "What kind of a lesson have I to learn from these fools?" When he thought this, </div>
<div id="tw_47" class="t s1_47">Janaka started laughing. He said, "Why are you laughing?" </div>
<div id="tx_47" class="t s1_47">Janaka said, "I am laughing because your old man knows something, he understands </div>
<div id="ty_47" class="t s1_47">something, but you don't believe in him. You don't believe in your master. You have </div>
<div id="tz_47" class="t s1_47">come, but reluctantly." </div>
<div id="t10_47" class="t s1_47">He was surprised: how had Janaka come to know this? He asked, "You seemed to be </div>
<div id="t11_47" class="t s1_47">almost drunk and still you can understand? -- and I have not said anything." </div>
<div id="t12_47" class="t s1_47">Janaka said, "About this wine we will talk later on. Right now you do one thing; </div>
<div id="t13_47" class="t s1_47">otherwise I am going to kill you." He ordered his soldiers to take their swords out of </div>
<div id="t14_47" class="t s1_47">their sheaths and surround the court and give the sannyasin a cup full of oil, so full that </div>
<div id="t15_47" class="t s1_47">it could not contain even a single drop more. And he told the sannyasin, "Put this cup </div>
