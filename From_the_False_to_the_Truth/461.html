<div id="t1_461" class="t s1_461">CHAPTER 41. GOD IS THE BUSINESS OF THE PRIEST</div>
<div id="t2_461" class="t s2_461">And Barabbas could not believe it himself. He was also thinking that this young fellow, who was only</div>
<div id="t3_461" class="t s2_461">thirty-three... and he had heard him, he was always talking around the place. He was moving around</div>
<div id="t4_461" class="t s2_461">Jerusalem on his donkey, and whenever he could get an audience he would start talking. He was</div>
<div id="t5_461" class="t s2_461">a street sermonizer – so once in a while Barabbas had heard him talk, and he liked him, the fellow</div>
<div id="t6_461" class="t s2_461">was nice and he was saying beautiful things. He hoped, of course, that he would be released, but</div>
<div id="t7_461" class="t s2_461">when he was told by the Jews, he could not believe it. He was shocked. When he was taken away</div>
<div id="t8_461" class="t s2_461">from the cross he still could not believe that it was real. He looked back again and again, walking</div>
<div id="t9_461" class="t s2_461">towards the pub. And within seven days he had killed another man.</div>
<div id="ta_461" class="t s2_461">So Pontius Pilate was very willing, and the cave in which Jesus was put was guarded by a Roman</div>
<div id="tb_461" class="t s2_461">guard. The Jews could not do it because it was their Sabbath day, on which day they cannot do</div>
<div id="tc_461" class="t s2_461">anything.</div>
<div id="td_461" class="t s2_461">The cruciﬁxion happened on Friday, it was an arrangement.</div>
<div id="te_461" class="t s2_461">The whole credit goes to</div>
<div id="tf_461" class="t s2_461">Pontius Pilate, not to God and resurrection. It was arranged that on Friday – because Saturday is</div>
<div id="tg_461" class="t s2_461">the Sabbath day of the Jews; they don’t do anything, everything stops – on the Friday the cruciﬁxion</div>
<div id="th_461" class="t s2_461">was delayed as much as possible, because until Pontius Pilate comes the cruciﬁxion cannot happen.</div>
<div id="ti_461" class="t s2_461">He went as late as possible, so the cruciﬁxion happened just after twelve o’clock in the middle of the</div>
<div id="tj_461" class="t s2_461">day. And the Jewish cross is such that if a healthy man is on it, it will take forty-eight hours for him</div>
<div id="tk_461" class="t s2_461">to die – because it is a very slow process, a slow torture.</div>
<div id="tl_461" class="t s2_461">Blood starts moving from the hands and the legs. Only four nails are used: two in the hands, two</div>
<div id="tm_461" class="t s2_461">in the legs. So slowly the blood oozes out. And blood has a tendency to get dry. It has a chemical</div>
<div id="tn_461" class="t s2_461">element that dries it; if you don’t have that chemical then your life is always in danger.</div>
<div id="to_461" class="t s2_461">There is a disease called hemophilia where your blood goes on ﬂowing, it does not dry. That was an</div>
<div id="tp_461" class="t s2_461">important factor in the situation before the Russian revolution. The Czar’s only son had hemophilia</div>
<div id="tq_461" class="t s2_461">– the only son, who was going to succeed.</div>
<div id="tr_461" class="t s2_461">And this was a problem, because it gave power to</div>
<div id="ts_461" class="t s2_461">Rasputin, a village priest, absolutely uneducated but with some knowledge of hypnotizing people.</div>
<div id="tt_461" class="t s2_461">He was called again and again; whenever the son started bleeding – any small scratch and the</div>
<div id="tu_461" class="t s2_461">blood cannot stop by itself; it won’t dry – Rasputin had to be called immediately. He became so</div>
<div id="tv_461" class="t s2_461">powerful that the czar, the emperor of Russia, was almost dependent on him.</div>
<div id="tw_461" class="t s2_461">The wife of the czar was just a worshipper of Rasputin, and he was a villager, who knew nothing</div>
<div id="tx_461" class="t s2_461">except a small strategy of hypnotizing people. So he used to hypnotize the boy, and in hypnosis he</div>
<div id="ty_461" class="t s2_461">used to tell him, ”Your blood will stop.” In hypnosis everything is possible.</div>
<div id="tz_461" class="t s2_461">Hypnosis is a very powerful method, and he was the only person who could make the blood stop.</div>
<div id="t10_461" class="t s2_461">No doctors were able to do anything; there is no cure in any medical science.</div>
<div id="t11_461" class="t s2_461">So it takes forty-eight hours for a person to die on the Jewish cross because the blood goes on again</div>
<div id="t12_461" class="t s2_461">and again drying; people have to remove the dry blood so that fresh blood starts coming again. It</div>
<div id="t13_461" class="t s2_461">takes forty-eight hours, and Jesus was only six hours on the cross – from twelve to six. As the sun</div>
<div id="t14_461" class="t s2_461">was setting he had to be taken off the cross, because on Saturday nothing can continue. Everything</div>
<div id="t15_461" class="t s2_461">stops; even cruciﬁxion has to stop. In six hours a young man of thirty-three cannot die. This is a</div>
<div id="t16_461" class="t s2_461">scientiﬁc fact.</div>
<div id="t17_461" class="t s2_461">And no Jew would be ready to guard, because that would be against his religion; he would be doing</div>
<div id="t18_461" class="t s2_461">some duty, some work. So a Roman was on guard – that was perfect. The stone was removed and</div>
<div id="t19_461" class="t s2_461">From the False to the Truth</div>
<div id="t1a_461" class="t s2_461">461</div>
<div id="t1b_461" class="t s3_461">Osho</div>
