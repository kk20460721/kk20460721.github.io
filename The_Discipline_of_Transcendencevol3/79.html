<div id="t2_79" class="t s1_79">something. </div>
<div id="t3_79" class="t s1_79">Buddha's negative approach says you are not lacking anything. In fact, you are </div>
<div id="t4_79" class="t s1_79">possessing too many things which are not needed. You have to drop something. </div>
<div id="t5_79" class="t s1_79">It is like this: A man goes trekking into the Himalayas. The higher you start </div>

<div id="t8_79" class="t s1_79">the more heavy your luggage will become. You will have to drop things. If you </div>
<div id="t9_79" class="t s1_79">want to reach to the highest peak, you will have to drop all. </div>
<div id="ta_79" class="t s1_79">Once you have dropped all, once you don't possess anything, once you have </div>

<div id="td_79" class="t s1_79">not accumulated. </div>
<div id="te_79" class="t s1_79">When Buddha attained, somebody asked him, "What have you attained?" </div>
<div id="tf_79" class="t s1_79">He laughed. He said, "I have not attained anything -- because whatsoever I have </div>
<div id="tg_79" class="t s1_79">attained was always with me. On the contrary, I have lost many things. I have </div>
<div id="th_79" class="t s1_79">lost my ego. I have lost my thoughts, my mind. I have lost all that I used to feel I </div>
<div id="ti_79" class="t s1_79">possessed. I have lost my body -- I used to think I was the body. I have lost all </div>

<div id="tk_79" class="t s1_79">Let me explain it to you, because this is very central. </div>
<div id="tl_79" class="t s1_79">According to Buddha's approach, in the beginningless beginning of existence </div>
<div id="tm_79" class="t s1_79">there was absolute sleep; existence was fast asleep, snoring, what Hindus call </div>
<div id="tn_79" class="t s1_79">SUSHUPTI, a state of dreamless sleep. The whole existence was asleep in </div>

<div id="ts_79" class="t s1_79">moments of that primordial nothingness, you don't feel rejuvenated, you don't </div>
<div id="tt_79" class="t s1_79">feel revitalized. If the whole night you dream, and turn and toss in the bed, in the </div>
<div id="tu_79" class="t s1_79">morning you are more tired than you were when you went to bed. You could not </div>

<div id="ty_79" class="t s1_79">rested, vitalized, new. Again full of juice, full of life and zest. That, Buddha says, </div>

<div id="t10_79" class="t s1_79">SUSHUPTI, it was tremendously unconscious; there was no consciousness in it. </div>
<div id="t11_79" class="t s1_79">It was just like samadhi, with only one difference: in samadhi one is fully awake. </div>
<div id="t12_79" class="t s1_79">In that SUSHUPTI, in that dreamless deep sleep, there was no consciousness, not </div>
<div id="t13_79" class="t s1_79">even a single flame of consciousness -- a dark night. It is also a state of </div>
<div id="t14_79" class="t s1_79">SATCHITANAND, but the state is unconscious. </div>
<div id="t15_79" class="t s1_79">In the morning when you become awake, then you say, "Last night was </div>
