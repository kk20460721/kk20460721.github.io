<div id="td_38" class="t s1_38">appeared. </div>
<div id="te_38" class="t s1_38">In the East just the opposite has been the case. Buddha is never painted with a beard, </div>
<div id="tf_38" class="t s1_38">neither is Krishna or Mahavira, neither is Rama or Patanjali... nobody. Why? -- because </div>

<div id="t11_38" class="t s1_38">could not become a world religion. The followers of Zarathustra are confined to </div>
<div id="t12_38" class="t s1_38">Bombay only. And they are good people -- not religious in the ordinary sense, not at all. </div>
<div id="t13_38" class="t s1_38">Nobody thinks that Parsis are religious; in India nobody thinks them religious. They </div>
