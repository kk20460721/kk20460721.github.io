<div id="t1_77" class="t s1_77">CHAPTER 6. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</div>
<div id="t2_77" class="t s2_77">Biologists say that this consciousness came to human life because long before, at least two million</div>
<div id="t3_77" class="t s2_77">years before, some apes, the forefathers of man, came down from the trees and began to walk on</div>
<div id="t4_77" class="t s2_77">two legs instead of on four. Instead of four, they began to walk on two legs. The two hands were</div>
<div id="t5_77" class="t s2_77">released.</div>
<div id="t6_77" class="t s2_77">With these two hands released many things happened, and the greatest was that the</div>
<div id="t7_77" class="t s2_77">factor of awareness came in. When the apes were on trees, they were not in any danger. They were</div>
<div id="t8_77" class="t s2_77">secured in their trees. No lion could kill them, no tiger could attack them. They were secured in their</div>
<div id="t9_77" class="t s2_77">trees. They were moving in their trees from one tree to another, and that was a mechanical thing –</div>
<div id="ta_77" class="t s2_77">inherent, hereditary.</div>
<div id="tb_77" class="t s2_77">But it is yet an unknown factor – an X – why certain apes came down to earth.</div>
<div id="tc_77" class="t s2_77">It seems many</div>
<div id="td_77" class="t s2_77">reasons are possible. It seems that either there was a sudden population explosion: they were so</div>
<div id="te_77" class="t s2_77">many that they had to ﬁnd somewhere new to live – trees were less and they became more; or,</div>
<div id="tf_77" class="t s2_77">suddenly there were no rains for many years, and trees died and became dry, and they had to come</div>
<div id="tg_77" class="t s2_77">down. But whatsoever may have happened, these are all guesses.</div>
<div id="th_77" class="t s2_77">Someone has suggested recently, a great scientist, that it seems that humanity was born out of</div>
<div id="ti_77" class="t s2_77">illness. Some apes became very ill because of an attack of a certain virus, a certain illness. Apes</div>
<div id="tj_77" class="t s2_77">became so ill that they could not live by hanging on the trees.</div>
<div id="tk_77" class="t s2_77">They became so weak that they</div>
<div id="tl_77" class="t s2_77">had to come to the earth.</div>
<div id="tm_77" class="t s2_77">It is possible, but whatsoever may have been the basic cause, this</div>
<div id="tn_77" class="t s2_77">man is certain that when apes came down to the earth they had to be more alert.</div>
<div id="to_77" class="t s2_77">Then their</div>
<div id="tp_77" class="t s2_77">mechanical habits alone couldn’t do, their inherited instincts weren’t sufﬁcient. They had to walk on</div>
<div id="tq_77" class="t s2_77">an unknown territory. The very walking, the stature, the posture, was so new, and their bodies were</div>
<div id="tr_77" class="t s2_77">not accustomed to it. With two-legged walking, they became biped from quadruped. In their cells</div>
<div id="ts_77" class="t s2_77">there was no knowledge about it. That is why when a man is born, when a child is born, he still has</div>
<div id="tt_77" class="t s2_77">to learn to walk. Still it is not instinctive.</div>
<div id="tu_77" class="t s2_77">A horse is born: he can run. A calf is born: he can run. No need to learn to walk. But man has to</div>
<div id="tv_77" class="t s2_77">learn to walk. And if you put a small child somewhere where no one walks and he cannot imitate,</div>
<div id="tw_77" class="t s2_77">then he will not walk for his whole life.</div>
<div id="tx_77" class="t s2_77">In certain wolves’ caves, some children have been found who had grown up with wolves. They could</div>
<div id="ty_77" class="t s2_77">not walk. Just four or ﬁve years back, in a forest of U.P. (India), a boy of fourteen was found in a</div>
<div id="tz_77" class="t s2_77">community of wolves. They must have taken him from the village, and then he was brought up by</div>
<div id="t10_77" class="t s2_77">them. Fourteen years, and he couldn’t walk! He was not a biped: he was still a quadruped. He</div>
<div id="t11_77" class="t s2_77">would walk on all fours, and he would walk like a wolf, not like a man.</div>
<div id="t12_77" class="t s2_77">Walking is still an effort, so when a child walks parents are so happy.</div>
<div id="t13_77" class="t s2_77">The reason is because</div>
<div id="t14_77" class="t s2_77">this is something valuable, an achievement. We have in our language many things which show this</div>
<div id="t15_77" class="t s2_77">attitude. We say that someone is ”standing on his own legs; he is standing on his own two feet”. This</div>
<div id="t16_77" class="t s2_77">is something valuable, something worthwhile, something to be appreciated. We condemn someone</div>
<div id="t17_77" class="t s2_77">by saying, ”You are still not standing on your own two feet.”</div>
<div id="t18_77" class="t s2_77">Because man came into a new situation from the trees to the earth – in which everything was new, in</div>
<div id="t19_77" class="t s2_77">which the robot would not work, in which instinct would not help – that is why intelligence developed.</div>
<div id="t1a_77" class="t s2_77">He had to be aware, and he had to be aware every moment because there were so many dangers</div>
<div id="t1b_77" class="t s2_77">all around. He was surrounded by enemies, and he was weak because no instinct would help now.</div>
<div id="t1c_77" class="t s2_77">This dangerous situation was the ﬁrst school for alertness. He had to be alert!</div>
<div id="t1d_77" class="t s2_77">The Ultimate Alchemy, Vol 2</div>
