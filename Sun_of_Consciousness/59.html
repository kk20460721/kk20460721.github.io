<div id="t1_59" class="t s1_59">CHAPTER 6. THE SUTRA OF ULTIMATE LIFE</div>
<div id="t2_59" class="t s2_59">plunged the bayonet in his chest. They thought that he was deceiving them. At the time of his death</div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s2_59">he did say two words- he broke his thirty years silence at the time of his death. And the breaking</div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s2_59">of his silence of thirty years was really strange. And the answer that he had given was even more</div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s2_59">strange, because the soldiers were asking him, ”Who are you?” He did not give any answer to this.</div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s2_59">At the time of his death he opened his eyes and laughed again and he had used a great line from the</div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s2_59">Upanishad. He had said to the British soldiers who had plunged the bayonet in him, ”That art thou,</div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s2_59">white man, you are also that! They had asked, ”Who are you?” He had replied at the time of his</div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s2_59">death, ”You are also that.”He had not said, ”Whoever I am, you are also that.” The rest he dropped,</div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s2_59">that is understood. He dropped saying I am also that because who will say, ”I am that”, there is no</div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s2_59">’I’ left. He had replied in a round-about-way. He said, ”You are also that, That art thou.”</div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s2_59">Who knows, maybe the soldiers did not get the hint, it is difﬁcult that they could have understood.</div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s2_59">”Who am I?” In the end, this search becomes in the disappearance of ’I’. The search for it can only</div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s2_59">be done after the seventh sutra, before that it is very difﬁcult. It is easy after the seventh sutra. Now</div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s2_59">we can ask because now we are awake, now we are ﬁlled with light, we can ask, ”Who am I?” And</div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s2_59">this question is the only religious question. You can never ﬁnd its answer. It is not that you get the</div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s2_59">answer that you are god. Till you get this answer, understand that it is your mind answering. The</div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s2_59">scriptures you have read, they are answering. The words you have heard, they are answering. The</div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s2_59">doctrines that you have learnt, they are answering.</div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s2_59">That eighth sutra does not get solved by scriptures, will not get solved by doctrines. So if your mind</div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s2_59">gives the answer to this eighth sutra that you are Brahma or what I said just now’That art thou’,</div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s2_59">you must have also read it, then that is not the solution. You ask yourself, ”Who am I?” and the</div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s2_59">mind says, ”You are that”, that is also not the solution. Till you can give the answer, you will not ﬁnd</div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s2_59">the answer because you don’t have the answer, you only have words. ”Who am I?”, this question</div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s2_59">should go so deep in you that the answer does not arise in you, only the question remains - only</div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s2_59">a silent question remains. Each breath starts asking, ”Who am I?”,every core starts asking, ”Who</div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s2_59">am I?”, every heartbeat starts asking, ”Who am I?” - sitting, standing, walking, questioning or not</div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s2_59">questioning; only one question starts echoing in your mind, ”Who am I?” And you don’t ﬁnd any</div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s2_59">answer. There is no answer because if you have the answer with you then there is no need to ask.</div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s2_59">But all of us have answers, that is why in the eighth sutra all scriptures become barriers.</div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s2_59">All</div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s2_59">knowledge becomes a barrier. That which we call knowledge, all that we have learnt, understood,</div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s2_59">memorized, all becomes a barrier. Even the greatest words become barriers-Geeta, Kuran, Bible</div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s2_59">all become barriers. Whatever we have read, whatever we have learnt, all starts becoming a barrier</div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s2_59">in the eighth sutra because it is our memory which answers that I am this, I am this, I am this. All</div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s2_59">these answers have to be destroyed. These answers are not ours. Those who have given them,</div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s2_59">must have known before giving them, must have understood before giving them but these answers</div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s2_59">are not ours. This answer is not mine. This knowing is not mine, it is borrowed, it is stale.</div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s2_59">Before this eighth sutra, a person will have to drop all knowledge and become totally ignorant. And</div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s2_59">one who is capable of becoming ignorant - this ignorant is of a completely different kind. Socrates</div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s2_59">has made a small, very beautiful distinction. And the people who have reached near the eighth sutra,</div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s2_59">Socrates is one of them.</div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s2_59">Some people of the village went to Socrates and said, ”The Goddess</div>
<div id="t18_59" class="t s2_59">of Delphi has declared that no one is wiser than Socrates.” They said, ”These are the words of</div>
<div id="t19_59" class="t s2_59">the Goddess of Delphi that no one is wiser than Socrates!</div>
<div id="t1a_59" class="t s2_59">- what do you say?”Socrates said,</div>
<div id="t1b_59" class="t s2_59">”Somewhere or the other, there has been some mistake because I say to you that no one is more</div>
<div id="t1c_59" class="t s2_59">Sun of Consciousness</div>
<div id="t1d_59" class="t s2_59">59</div>
<div id="t1e_59" class="t s3_59">Osho</div>
