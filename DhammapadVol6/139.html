<div id="t1_139" class="t s1_139">courage is such, their search is such... they are passionate lovers of truth. That's why </div>
<div id="t2_139" class="t s1_139">they will be able to understand me. </div>
<div id="t3_139" class="t s1_139">"The ninety-nine percent will never understand, the one percent who are capable of </div>
<div id="t4_139" class="t s1_139">understanding me will understand it anyway, whether I speak or not. In fact it will be </div>
<div id="t5_139" class="t s1_139">easier for them to understand if I don't speak. My silence will be more of a communion </div>
<div id="t6_139" class="t s1_139">with them. So what is the point of speaking?" </div>
<div id="t7_139" class="t s1_139">The gods were very much worried how to answer this. They gathered together, they </div>
<div id="t8_139" class="t s1_139">discussed among themselves, then they came again with a new argument and they said, </div>
<div id="t9_139" class="t s1_139">"Listen! You are right, there are people who will never understand you and there are </div>
<div id="ta_139" class="t s1_139">people who will understand even without your saying a single word. But can you deny </div>
<div id="tb_139" class="t s1_139">that there are people between these two? Can you say there is not a single person who </div>
<div id="tc_139" class="t s1_139">is just between these two categories, a third category, who will understand if you speak, </div>
<div id="td_139" class="t s1_139">and who will never understand if you don't speak? Can you deny -- it may be a very </div>
<div id="te_139" class="t s1_139">small minority, it may be one in a million, but can you deny that one single person -- </div>
<div id="tf_139" class="t s1_139">that link between the majority and the minority? The nonunderstanders and the </div>
<div id="tg_139" class="t s1_139">understanders... they are linked." </div>
<div id="th_139" class="t s1_139">Buddha could not deny it. He said, "You are right, there ARE a few people; yes, one in a </div>
<div id="ti_139" class="t s1_139">million who will be helped." </div>
<div id="tj_139" class="t s1_139">"Then," those gods said, "even if it is only one in a million, it is your to duty help him." </div>
<div id="tk_139" class="t s1_139">It is because of this argument that Buddha started speaking; otherwise he was not going </div>
<div id="tl_139" class="t s1_139">to speak. And remember, there have been many buddhas who have not spoken. They </div>
<div id="tm_139" class="t s1_139">remained silent their entire lives, you will never hear about them because they have </div>
<div id="tn_139" class="t s1_139">never spoken. No scripture exists to describe them. </div>
<div id="to_139" class="t s1_139">One point I would like to make very clear to you: that each individual when he becomes </div>
<div id="tp_139" class="t s1_139">enlightened, becomes part of the universal -- but his expression still remains individual. </div>
<div id="tq_139" class="t s1_139">His experience is universal, but his expression is individual. If he was a poet before, like </div>
<div id="tr_139" class="t s1_139">Kabir, when he becomes enlightened he will sing songs. If he was a poet, if being a poet </div>
<div id="ts_139" class="t s1_139">was part of his individuality -- now knowing the universal, his understanding, his light, </div>
<div id="tt_139" class="t s1_139">will start flowing into the old patterns of poetry. He will be like Kabir, Nanak, Farid. </div>
<div id="tu_139" class="t s1_139">But if he was a painter, not a poet, and he becomes enlightened, then he will paint -- </div>
<div id="tv_139" class="t s1_139">that will be his natural way of expressing. If he was a sculptor then his expression will </div>
<div id="tw_139" class="t s1_139">be different. </div>
<div id="tx_139" class="t s1_139">Each buddha lives in the universal but expresses himself individually. This is Jesus' </div>
<div id="ty_139" class="t s1_139">expression, he is all too human. Maybe that is his appeal -- now almost half the earth is </div>
<div id="tz_139" class="t s1_139">in love with Jesus. The reason is his humanity. Buddha is a faraway star, Jesus seems to </div>
<div id="t10_139" class="t s1_139">be very close to the heart. Buddha appeals to the very sophisticated, Jesus' appeal is for </div>
<div id="t11_139" class="t s1_139">the masses. </div>
<div id="t12_139" class="t s1_139">Whenever a country becomes sophisticated, cultured, educated, rich, affluent, Jesus' </div>
<div id="t13_139" class="t s1_139">appeal starts disappearing. That's what is happening in America. Buddha is becoming </div>
<div id="t14_139" class="t s1_139">more and more powerful: more and more Zen centers are being opened, more and more </div>
<div id="t15_139" class="t s1_139">people are becoming converted from prayer to meditation, more and more people are </div>
<div id="t16_139" class="t s1_139">becoming interested in the sayings of Buddha. </div>
