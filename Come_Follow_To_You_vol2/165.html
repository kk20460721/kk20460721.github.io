<div id="t2_165" class="t s1_165">stupid, but that's how humanity is. He said, "You do one thing. There is no need </div>
<div id="t3_165" class="t s1_165">to come to me. In your own capital there is a very poor man and he may want to </div>
<div id="t4_165" class="t s1_165">bargain with you. He has also attained. You go to him." </div>
<div id="t5_165" class="t s1_165">The king had never heard the name of that poor man, but he said, "I will go." He </div>
<div id="t6_165" class="t s1_165">went to that poor man. He was really a beggar, but with the same light in his </div>
<div id="t7_165" class="t s1_165">eyes as Mahavir, with the same fragrance around him, with the same innocence. </div>
<div id="t8_165" class="t s1_165">He was sitting under a tree. The king said, "You are part of my kingdom and </div>
<div id="t9_165" class="t s1_165">whatsoever you have attained -- give it to me! Whatsoever you want in return, I </div>
<div id="ta_165" class="t s1_165">am ready to give. Even if you want my whole kingdom, I will give it to you. But </div>
<div id="tb_165" class="t s1_165">bring out, give me, your SAMADHI." </div>
<div id="tc_165" class="t s1_165">The man laughed. He said, "I can give you my life, it is in your hands, but I </div>
<div id="td_165" class="t s1_165">cannot give you SAMADHI. Not that I don't want to give it, but the very nature </div>
<div id="te_165" class="t s1_165">of it is such that it cannot be given. You will have to earn it." </div>
<div id="tf_165" class="t s1_165">The king said, "But I have never earned anything. I am a conqueror. Whatsoever </div>
<div id="tg_165" class="t s1_165">I need, I simply conquer it. I'm not a businessman; I never earn anything. I am a </div>
<div id="th_165" class="t s1_165">KSHATRIYA, a warrior." </div>
<div id="ti_165" class="t s1_165">The beggar said, "But here, your swords won't do, nor your army. Here you will </div>
<div id="tj_165" class="t s1_165">have to go alone, because it is a going inward. You have to go to your own </div>
<div id="tk_165" class="t s1_165">center. And it cannot be given because you already have it. It has only to be </div>
<div id="tl_165" class="t s1_165">known, discovered." </div>
<div id="tm_165" class="t s1_165">Our ignorance is the only reason that we don't have it. Not that we don't have it -</div>
<div id="tn_165" class="t s1_165">- it has been always there -- but we have forgotten it. We have become oblivious </div>
<div id="to_165" class="t s1_165">to it, our eyes have become clouded. The vision has lost the crystal clarity that is </div>
<div id="tp_165" class="t s1_165">needed to rediscover it. </div>
<div id="tq_165" class="t s1_165">Have you watched? Sometimes you are trying to remember somebody's name. </div>
<div id="tr_165" class="t s1_165">You know it, and still it is not coming. You feel very puzzled. You say it is just on </div>
<div id="ts_165" class="t s1_165">the tip of the tongue. You say, "I KNOW it," but if somebody insists, "If you </div>
<div id="tt_165" class="t s1_165">know it, then why don't you tell it?" you say, "But it is not coming." </div>
<div id="tu_165" class="t s1_165">Have you watched this emptiness? You know the name, you know that you </div>
<div id="tv_165" class="t s1_165">know it, but there is a gap. But that gap is not empty, that gap is not passive. </div>
<div id="tw_165" class="t s1_165">That gap is very active, intensely active. That gap is searching, that gap itself is in </div>
<div id="tx_165" class="t s1_165">search for the forgotten name. </div>
<div id="ty_165" class="t s1_165">And another thing if you watch: somebody suggests some name and you say, </div>
<div id="tz_165" class="t s1_165">"No, it is not that." This is beautiful. You don't know what is true, but you know </div>
<div id="t10_165" class="t s1_165">what is false. You say, "That is not it." Somebody suggests some other name. You </div>
<div id="t11_165" class="t s1_165">say, "No, even that is not it. I know what it is!" The gap is not just a dead gap; it is </div>
<div id="t12_165" class="t s1_165">dynamic. It knows what is false, it knows what is not true, but it has forgotten </div>
<div id="t13_165" class="t s1_165">the truth. </div>
<div id="t14_165" class="t s1_165">So if somebody is teaching you a false god, you will immediately understand. </div>
<div id="t15_165" class="t s1_165">There is no problem about it. If somebody is giving you a false thing, you will </div>
<div id="t16_165" class="t s1_165">immediately understand it. You don't know what is true, you don't know what is </div>
