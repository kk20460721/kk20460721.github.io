<div id="t1_5" class="t s1_5">JOYOUS OR ANGRY, GOOD OR BAD, FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE -- THESE ARE</div>
<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">ALL TRIVIAL MATTERS, THE BRANCHES. IF YOU CAN BE SPONTANEOUSLY</div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">AWARE AND KNOWING AS YOU ARE GOING ALONG WITH CIRCUMSTANCES,</div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">THEN THERE IS NEITHER LACK NOR EXCESS.</div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">The great Zen teacher Ta Hui comes from the same lineage as Bodhidharma. He was born</div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">four hundred years after Bodhidharma had left for the Himalayas, to disappear into the eternal</div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">ice, the eternal silence there.</div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">I have called Ta Hui the great Zen teacher -- not a master ... it has to be explained to you</div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">clearly. The master is one who is enlightened. but sometimes it happens that the master may</div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">be enlightened, but is not articulate enough to give expression to what he has known. That is a</div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">totally different art.</div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">The teacher is not enlightened, but he is very articulate. He can say things which the</div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">master, although he knows, cannot bring to words. The teacher can say them, although he does</div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">not know.</div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">The teacher he has heard ... he has lived with enlightened people, he has imbibed their</div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">energy, he has been showered by their flowers. He has tasted something transpiring from the</div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">enlightened ones, so he has a certainty that something like enlightenment happens, but he has</div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">no authority of his own; his authority is borrowed. And if the teacher is a genius, he can</div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">almost manage to express things over which masters have faltered, or they have remained</div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">silent.</div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">The teacher has his own utility. He is more available to the people -- he belongs to the</div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">people. The master is on a high sunlit peak. Even if he shouts from there, only echoes reach to</div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">the people's ears. But the teacher lives amongst the people, knows their life, knows their</div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">language, knows how things should be expressed so they can understand. The master remains</div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">committed to his experience, while the teacher is more committed to the people, to spread the</div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">message.</div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">Once in a while it happens that the master cannot express at all. For example,</div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">Ramakrishna was an enlightened man, but utterly uneducated, uncultured, knowing nothing of</div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">great literature, knowing nothing of what other enlightened people have said. He experienced</div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">the beauty of his inner being, but he was absolutely handicapped as far as conveying it to</div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">others. He had to take the support of a man, Vivekananda, who was not enlightened but was a</div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">great genius -- very intelligent, rational, logical, intellectual, well-versed, well-educated. He</div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s1_5">became the mouthpiece of Ramakrishna. He went around the world spreading his message.</div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s1_5">Whatever exists today as Ramakrishna Mission, is completely the work of Vivekananda,</div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s1_5">but he himself died in utter agony. The agony was more intense because he had been</div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">spreading the good news of ecstasy, but inside he was empty. His whole message was only</div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">verbal, but he managed it so cleverly that many started thinking of him as enlightened.</div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">The same thing happened with Ta Hui. When he was just sixteen years old he was so</div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s1_5">intelligent ... he left the world, and after one year of preparation he was initiated as a monk,</div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s1_5">when he was just seventeen. Then he went from master to master, seeking the right</div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s1_5">enlightened man who could show him the way.</div>
<div id="t16_5" class="t s1_5">He found his master in Yuan Wu. It seems almost the same situation: Yuan Wu knows,</div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s1_5">but cannot say it. Ta Hui does not know, but can say it. Just living with the master, imbibing</div>
<div id="t18_5" class="t s1_5">Chapter 1 - Clear the mind</div>
<div id="t19_5" class="t s1_5">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1a_5" class="t s1_5">5</div>
