<div id="t1_153" class="t s1_153">been given to the poor. There are beggars outside the house. This money could have fed </div>
<div id="t2_153" class="t s1_153">many beggars for many days. It was rare perfume! Why waste it? The feet can be </div>
<div id="t3_153" class="t s1_153">washed with water -- there is no need!" And she had poured the whole big bottle of </div>
<div id="t4_153" class="t s1_153">perfume! </div>
<div id="t5_153" class="t s1_153">Now, with whom are you going to agree? And do you know what Jesus said? Jesus </div>
<div id="t6_153" class="t s1_153">said, "The beggars will always be there. I will not be here always." </div>
<div id="t7_153" class="t s1_153">This does not seem to be a very appealing argument! Jesus says, "Don't disturb her. </div>
<div id="t8_153" class="t s1_153">Don't disturb her love, her faith, her trust. It's perfectly alright. It is coming from her </div>
<div id="t9_153" class="t s1_153">deep love for me. Let her do it. And beggars will always be there. Even if this money is </div>
<div id="ta_153" class="t s1_153">given to them, nothing much is going to happen. Maybe for a few days they will be able </div>
<div id="tb_153" class="t s1_153">to eat; then again</div>
<div id="tc_153" class="t s1_153">....</div>
<div id="td_153" class="t s1_153">" </div>
<div id="te_153" class="t s1_153">With whom are you going to agree? Ninety-nine percent is the possibility you will </div>
<div id="tf_153" class="t s1_153">agree with Judas -- and more so after Karl Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao; after so </div>
<div id="tg_153" class="t s1_153">much socialistic communist propaganda all over the world, who will not agree with </div>
<div id="th_153" class="t s1_153">Judas? He seems to be the forerunner of socialistic philosophy. And Jesus' answer does </div>
<div id="ti_153" class="t s1_153">not seem to be very appealing, convincing. It seems to be evading the question, evading </div>
<div id="tj_153" class="t s1_153">the issue. But Judas betrayed Jesus for the simple reason that he was too much in his </div>
<div id="tk_153" class="t s1_153">intellect, too egoistic, too proud. </div>
<div id="tl_153" class="t s1_153">The same happened again with Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. Ouspensky was the most </div>
<div id="tm_153" class="t s1_153">articulate disciple of Gurdjieff. In fact, it is because of Ouspensky that Gurdjieff became </div>
<div id="tn_153" class="t s1_153">famous in the world. It is Ouspensky's books that have made Gurdjieff's name known </div>
<div id="to_153" class="t s1_153">to the world at large. But why did he betray him? In the last years of his life he was very </div>
<div id="tp_153" class="t s1_153">antagonistic to his master. Even to mention Gurdjieff's name in Ouspensky's presence </div>
<div id="tq_153" class="t s1_153">was an offense to him; he did not tolerate even mentioning Gurdjieff's name. It has been </div>
<div id="tr_153" class="t s1_153">completely dropped -- even in his books which were written before he disconnected </div>
<div id="ts_153" class="t s1_153">himself from Gurdjieff. He changed the name from Gurdjieff to just G; he would not </div>
<div id="tt_153" class="t s1_153">write the whole name. He would simply mention, "G said..." -- just like XYZ. And then -</div>
<div id="tu_153" class="t s1_153">- he was clever enough -- whenever somebody asked, "You yourself mentioned G," he </div>
<div id="tv_153" class="t s1_153">said, "Those were the days when he was right. The later Gurdjieff has gone insane. I am </div>
<div id="tw_153" class="t s1_153">against the later Gurdjieff." </div>
<div id="tx_153" class="t s1_153">And why did he go against him? Gurdjieff was trying to destroy his ego totally and it </div>
<div id="ty_153" class="t s1_153">was impossible for him to accept that. He was in London, Gurdjieff was in Russia, in </div>
<div id="tz_153" class="t s1_153">Tiflis, and Gurdjieff sent a message, "Come immediately. Sell everything there. Don't </div>
<div id="t10_153" class="t s1_153">waste a single moment. Bring all the money and come." </div>
<div id="t11_153" class="t s1_153">Those were the days of the first world war; it was very difficult to travel, dangerous to </div>
<div id="t12_153" class="t s1_153">travel, and going back to Russia was dangerous for Ouspensky because the Bolsheviks, </div>
<div id="t13_153" class="t s1_153">communists, had come into power and Russia, the whole of Russia was in a turmoil. </div>
<div id="t14_153" class="t s1_153">There was no order, no government. </div>
<div id="t15_153" class="t s1_153">Still, the master had asked, so he sold all his possessions, his house, took all the money </div>
<div id="t16_153" class="t s1_153">and traveled back to Russia knowing perfectly well he was going into danger. The </div>
<div id="t17_153" class="t s1_153">journey was long; three months it took for him to reach, sometimes traveling by train </div>
<div id="t18_153" class="t s1_153">and sometimes by horse and sometimes he was prevented and the police were after </div>
<div id="t19_153" class="t s1_153">him. But somehow he reached there -- the master had asked him to come, and he did. </div>
