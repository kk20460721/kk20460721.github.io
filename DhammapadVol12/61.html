<div id="tj_61" class="t s1_61">the world, but there was no bliss. And he was thinking that once you become rich, bliss </div>
<div id="tk_61" class="t s1_61">is attained. He was very frustrated. That is the fate of all successful people. He started </div>
<div id="tl_61" class="t s1_61">going around asking for any wise person who could help him to attain bliss. </div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s1_61">Somebody suggested a Sufi master. He went to the Sufi master on his beautiful horse. </div>

<div id="tw_61" class="t s1_61">anybody; it was difficult. A crowd started following. They knew the Sufi master, that </div>

<div id="ty_61" class="t s1_61">Finally they came back to the same tree where the master had been sitting and the rich </div>

<div id="t12_61" class="t s1_61">And the master said, "Have you tasted a little bit of bliss? Unless you lose it you cannot </div>
