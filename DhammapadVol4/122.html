<div id="t1_122" class="t s1_122">A moment comes in the religious explorer's life when he disappears into the mystery </div>
<div id="t2_122" class="t s1_122">like a dewdrop evaporating in the morning sun. Then only mystery remains. That is the </div>
<div id="t3_122" class="t s1_122">highest peak of fulfillment, of contentment; one has arrived home. You can call it God, </div>
<div id="t4_122" class="t s1_122">nirvana, or whatsoever you like. </div>
<div id="t5_122" class="t s1_122">I am not against science -- my approach is basically scientific. But science has </div>
<div id="t6_122" class="t s1_122">limitations, and I don't stop where science stops; I go on, I go beyond. Use science, but </div>
<div id="t7_122" class="t s1_122">don't be used by it. It is good to have great technology; certainly it helps man to get rid </div>
<div id="t8_122" class="t s1_122">of stupid work, certainly it helps man to get rid of many kinds of slavery. Technology </div>
<div id="t9_122" class="t s1_122">can help man and animals both. Animals are also tortured; they are suffering very much </div>
<div id="ta_122" class="t s1_122">because we are using them. Machines can replace them, machines can do all the work. </div>
<div id="tb_122" class="t s1_122">Man and animals can both be free. </div>
<div id="tc_122" class="t s1_122">And I would like a humanity which is totally free from work, because in that state you </div>
<div id="td_122" class="t s1_122">will start growing -- in aesthetic sense, sensitivity, relaxation, meditation. You will </div>
<div id="te_122" class="t s1_122">become more artistic and you will become more spiritual because you will have time </div>
<div id="tf_122" class="t s1_122">and energy available. </div>
<div id="tg_122" class="t s1_122">I am not against science, I am not antiscience at all. I would like the world to have more </div>
<div id="th_122" class="t s1_122">and more of science, so that man can become available for something higher, for </div>
<div id="ti_122" class="t s1_122">something which a poor man cannot afford. </div>
<div id="tj_122" class="t s1_122">Religion is the ultimate in luxury. The poor man has to think about bread and butter -- </div>
<div id="tk_122" class="t s1_122">he cannot even manage that. He has to think about a shelter, clothes, children, medicine, </div>
<div id="tl_122" class="t s1_122">and he cannot manage these small things. His whole life is burdened by trivia; he has </div>
<div id="tm_122" class="t s1_122">no space, no time to devote to God. And even if he goes to the temple or to the church, </div>
<div id="tn_122" class="t s1_122">he goes to ask only for material things. His prayer is not true prayer, it is not that of </div>
<div id="to_122" class="t s1_122">gratitude; it is a demand, a desire. He wants this, he wants that -- and we cannot </div>
<div id="tp_122" class="t s1_122">condemn him, he has to be forgiven. The needs are there and he is constantly under a </div>
<div id="tq_122" class="t s1_122">weight. How can he find a few hours just to sit silently, doing nothing? The mind goes </div>
<div id="tr_122" class="t s1_122">on thinking. He has to think about the tomorrow. </div>
<div id="ts_122" class="t s1_122">Jesus says: Look at the lilies in the field; they toil not, they don't think of the morrow. </div>
<div id="tt_122" class="t s1_122">And they are far more beautiful than even Solomon, the great king, in all his grandeur, </div>
<div id="tu_122" class="t s1_122">ever was. </div>
<div id="tv_122" class="t s1_122">True, the lilies toil not and they don't think of the morrow. But can you say it to a poor </div>
<div id="tw_122" class="t s1_122">man? If he does not think of the morrow, then tomorrow is death. He has to prepare for </div>
<div id="tx_122" class="t s1_122">it; he has to think from where he is going to get his food, where he is going to be </div>
<div id="ty_122" class="t s1_122">employed. He has to think. He has children and a wife, he has an old mother and an old </div>
<div id="tz_122" class="t s1_122">father. He cannot be like the lilies of the field. How can he avoid toil, labor, work? -- </div>
<div id="t10_122" class="t s1_122">that will be suicidal. </div>
<div id="t11_122" class="t s1_122">The lilies are certainly beautiful and I totally agree with Jesus, but Jesus' statement is not </div>
<div id="t12_122" class="t s1_122">yet applicable to the greater part of humanity. Unless humanity becomes very rich, the </div>
<div id="t13_122" class="t s1_122">statement will remain just theoretical; it will not have any practical use. </div>
<div id="t14_122" class="t s1_122">I would like the world to be richer than it is. I don't believe in poverty and I don't </div>

<div id="t16_122" class="t s1_122">that poverty is something spiritual; it was just a consolation. </div>
