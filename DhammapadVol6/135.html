<div id="t6_135" class="t s1_135">and he was always laughing. To him there is nothing to weep for. What reason is there </div>
<div id="t7_135" class="t s1_135">to weep at the ridiculousness of man? </div>
<div id="t8_135" class="t s1_135">Three college boys, upon entering their favorite juke joint to sit at their usual table, </div>
<div id="t9_135" class="t s1_135">found it to be occupied by an oldish woman. After debating what to do about the </div>
<div id="ta_135" class="t s1_135">situation, they finally decided to embarrass the woman into leaving. </div>

<div id="te_135" class="t s1_135">know that I was born three months before my parents were married?" </div>
<div id="tf_135" class="t s1_135">"Why, that's nothing," said the next one. "I was born six months before my parents were </div>

<div id="tv_135" class="t s1_135">Jesus wept, I say something which Christians have denied down the ages. Christians </div>
