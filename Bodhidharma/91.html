<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">It is almost like a mirror. When you come before a mirror, do you think the </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">mirror thinks, "Should I reflect this fellow or not?" Do you think the mirror </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">thinks, "This guy looks like a mafia guy with sunglasses -- should I reflect him or </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">not?" Somebody is beautiful, somebody is ugly -- to the mirror it does not matter; </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">it is not a question of deciding. The mirror simply reflects them as his self-nature </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">-- the nature of the mirror is to reflect. There is no question of any decision or any </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">judgment. Seeing a beautiful woman, it does not appreciate her, or seeing a man </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">who looks like a camel, it does not hesitate even for a single moment whether to </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">reflect this fellow or not. </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">There is a beautiful story about one of the very great mystics, Ashtavakra. The </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">word ASHTAVAKRA means that he was the ugliest man you can conceive of. </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">On eight points in his body, he was just like a camel; nothing was as it should be. </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">Everything was wrong. His eyes -- one would be looking to the left and one </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">would be looking to the right. His legs -- one would be going this way, one </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">would be going that way </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">....</div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">he was a very strange fellow. How he managed is </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">difficult to conceive. </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">There was a great spiritual discussion going on in the court of the king, Janak, </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">and all great scholars of the country had gathered there. Ashtavakra's father had </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">also gone -- he was a well-known, learned scholar and there was every chance </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">that he might win. And there was a great prize for the winner. But it was getting </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">late and Ashtavakra's mother told him, "You should go and tell your father that </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">it is so late, and the food is getting cold. He can come and take his food, and then </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">he can go back. That discussion is going to continue for days -- so many scholars </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">...it is not going to be finished in one day." </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">So Ashtavakra went into the court of the king, and every single scholar started </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">laughing. They had never seen such an ugly man -- everything was wrong. </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">Ashtavakra looked at everybody and said to the king, "I thought that you had </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">gathered the wise people of the land. But these people seem to be shoemakers, </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">because they can't see my being. They can only see my skin, my bones. Are these </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">people shoemakers or butchers? Certainly they are not enlightened; otherwise </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">they would not have laughed. Their laughter is a judgment; they are humiliating </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">me because of this wrong body. But whether the body is wrong or right does not </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">matter; what matters is my consciousness." </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">King Janak was so much impressed that he dissolved the council of those learned </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">people, and he said, "Now I don't need you. The man I wanted to listen to has </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">come. I wanted a man who knows the ways of awareness, consciousness, of the </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">innermost being. And he is right -- you are only learned, but you are not </div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s1_91">enlightened." </div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">An enlightened man has no judgment. He acts without thinking about it. He acts </div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s1_91">out of no-mind. Hence his action has a beauty and grace and a truth and a </div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s1_91">goodness and a divineness in it. </div>
<div id="t18_91" class="t s1_91">...YOU HAVE TO ACT WITHOUT ACTING. </div>
<div id="t19_91" class="t s1_91">ONLY </div>
<div id="t1a_91" class="t s1_91">THEN </div>
<div id="t1b_91" class="t s1_91">WILL </div>
