<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">to prove your mettle. But I tell you that this is absolutely absurd. These religions </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">have been talking irreligion. There is no need for you to prove anything. The </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">very phenomenon that God has produced you is enough; you are accepted. God </div>

<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">you, you are already the emperor. </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">There is no need to postpone celebration. Immediately, right this moment you </div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">can celebrate. Nothing else is needed. To celebrate, life is needed and life you </div>

<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">an emperor. They had no crowns, but they had made crowns with leaves and </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">with flowers. Every woman was a queen. They didn't have kohinoors, but </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">whatsoever they had was too much, was enough. They danced the whole night </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">and then they fell asleep, there on the dancing-ground. By the morning they </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">were again back to work. They worked the whole day, and again by the evening </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">they were ready to celebrate, to dance. Russell says, 'That day, I felt really </div>

<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">meant for you to be crippled, but you live a crippled life, you live a paralyzed </div>

<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">nothing special in you. But who told you that to celebrate something special is </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">needed? In fact, the more you are after the special, the more and more it will </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">become difficult for you to dance. </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">Be ordinary. Nothing is wrong with ordinariness, because in your very </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">ordinariness you are extraordinary. Don't bother about the conditions to decide </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">when you will celebrate. If you bother about fulfilling certain conditions, do you </div>
<div id="t17_21" class="t s1_21">think that then you will celebrate? You will never celebrate, you will die a </div>
