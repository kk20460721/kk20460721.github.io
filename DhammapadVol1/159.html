<div id="t1_159" class="t s1_159">Why does life exist? and another was: Who created the world? In those eleven questions </div>
<div id="t2_159" class="t s1_159">the whole of philosophy is contained. In fact, if you drop those eleven questions </div>
<div id="t3_159" class="t s1_159">nothing remains to ask. </div>
<div id="t4_159" class="t s1_159">Buddha used to say these are useless questions. They are not answerable -- not because </div>
<div id="t5_159" class="t s1_159">nobody knows the answer. They are not answerable in the very nature of things. </div>
<div id="t6_159" class="t s1_159">One great philosopher, Maulingaputta, came to Buddha, and he started asking </div>
<div id="t7_159" class="t s1_159">questions...questions after questions. Must have been an incarnation of Patrick! Buddha </div>
<div id="t8_159" class="t s1_159">listened silently for half an hour. Maulingaputta started feeling a little embarrassed </div>
<div id="t9_159" class="t s1_159">because he was not answering, he was simply sitting there smiling, as if nothing had </div>
<div id="ta_159" class="t s1_159">happened, and he had asked such important questions, such significant questions. </div>
<div id="tb_159" class="t s1_159">Finally Buddha said, "Do you really want to know the answer?" </div>
<div id="tc_159" class="t s1_159">Maulingaputta said, "Otherwise why should I have come to you? I have traveled at least </div>
<div id="td_159" class="t s1_159">one thousand miles to see you." And remember, in those days, one thousand miles was </div>
<div id="te_159" class="t s1_159">really one thousand miles! It was not hopping in a plane and reaching within minutes </div>
<div id="tf_159" class="t s1_159">or within hours. One thousand miles was one thousand miles. It was with great </div>
<div id="tg_159" class="t s1_159">longing, with great hope that he had come. He was tired, weary from the journey, and </div>
<div id="th_159" class="t s1_159">he must have followed Buddha because Buddha himself was traveling continuously. </div>
<div id="ti_159" class="t s1_159">He must have reached one place and people said, "Yes, he was here three months ago. </div>
<div id="tj_159" class="t s1_159">He has gone to the north" -- so he must have traveled north. </div>
<div id="tk_159" class="t s1_159">Slowly slowly, he was coming closer and closer and then the day came, the great day, </div>
<div id="tl_159" class="t s1_159">when people said, "Just yesterday morning he left; he must have reached only the next </div>
<div id="tm_159" class="t s1_159">village. If you rush, if you run, you may be able to catch him." And then one day he </div>
<div id="tn_159" class="t s1_159">caught up with him, and he was so joyous he forgot all his arduous journey and he </div>
<div id="to_159" class="t s1_159">started asking all the questions he had planned all the way along, and Buddha smiled </div>
<div id="tp_159" class="t s1_159">and sat there and asked, "Do you really want to have the answer?" </div>
<div id="tq_159" class="t s1_159">Maulingaputta said, "Then why have I traveled so long? It has been a long suffering -- it </div>
<div id="tr_159" class="t s1_159">seems I have been traveling my whole life, and you are asking, 'Do you really want the </div>
<div id="ts_159" class="t s1_159">answer?'" </div>
<div id="tt_159" class="t s1_159">Buddha said, "I am asking again: Do you really want the answer? Say yes or no, because </div>
<div id="tu_159" class="t s1_159">much will depend on it." </div>
<div id="tv_159" class="t s1_159">Maulingaputta said, "Yes!" </div>
<div id="tw_159" class="t s1_159">Then Buddha said, "For two years sit silently by my side -- no asking, no questions, no </div>
<div id="tx_159" class="t s1_159">talking. Just sit silently by my side for two years. And after two years you can ask </div>
<div id="ty_159" class="t s1_159">whatsoever you want to ask, and I promise you I will answer it." </div>
<div id="tz_159" class="t s1_159">A disciple, a great disciple of Buddha, Manjushree, who was sitting underneath another </div>
<div id="t10_159" class="t s1_159">tree, started laughing so loudly, started almost rolling on the ground. Maulingaputta </div>
<div id="t11_159" class="t s1_159">said, "What has happened to this man? Out of the blue, you are talking to me, you have </div>
<div id="t12_159" class="t s1_159">not said a single word to him, nobody has said anything to him -- is he telling jokes to </div>
<div id="t13_159" class="t s1_159">himself?" </div>
<div id="t14_159" class="t s1_159">Buddha said, "You go and ask him." </div>
<div id="t15_159" class="t s1_159">He asked Manjushree. Manjushree said, "Sir, if you really want to ask the question, ask </div>
<div id="t16_159" class="t s1_159">right now -- this is his way of deceiving people. He deceived me. I used to be a foolish </div>
