<div id="t1_56" class="t s1_56">CHAPTER 4. DESIRE: THE LINK WITH LIFE</div>
<div id="t2_56" class="t s2_56">There will be a gap, an interim period, an interval. This I call a pregnancy period. The seed is born,</div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s2_56">but now it will gestate for at least nine months. And it may seem strange, but it happens. This nine</div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s2_56">months period is meaningful. Near about this, eight months or ten months, will be the interim period,</div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s2_56">and you will just become inactive. This inactivity will also vary. Someone may become so inactive</div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s2_56">that people may think that he has just gone into a coma. Everything stops.</div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s2_56">For Meher Baba it happened like that. For one year he was just in a coma. He couldn’t even move</div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s2_56">his limbs. Action was far off, he couldn’t stand up because even the desire to stand had gone. He</div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s2_56">couldn’t eat; he had to be forced. He couldn’t do anything! For one year continuously he became</div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s2_56">just helpless – a helpless child. This was a pregnancy period, and then, suddenly, a different man</div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s2_56">was born. The man who became inactive was no more: a new energy – energy accumulated.</div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s2_56">Lives and lives of dissipated energy create this gap – because you do not have enough energy.</div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s2_56">When desire is not there to invoke.</div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s2_56">provoke, stimulate, you just drop.</div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s2_56">Your energy is not really</div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s2_56">energy, but just a pushing and pulling.</div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s2_56">Anyhow you go on running because the goal seems just</div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s2_56">nearby. A few moments’ endeavour more and you will reach! You pull yourself on; somehow you</div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s2_56">carry yourself and run. But when the goal is dropped, when there is no desire, you will drop. An</div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s2_56">inactivity will be there. If you can be patient in this inactivity period, after it you will be reborn. Then</div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s2_56">energy will begin to move without desires.</div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s2_56">But I say it depends. It may happen suddenly as it happened for Meher Baba: that was a sudden</div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s2_56">case. It happened in Bombay. It happened by a kiss from an old lady, Babajan. Meher Baba was</div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s2_56">just passing, coming back from his school. Babajan was an old Suﬁ mystic, an old lady who was</div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s2_56">just sitting under a tree for years and years and years. Meher Baba was just coming, and Babajan</div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s2_56">called him. He knew this old lady. She was sitting for years under the tree, and he had passed by</div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s2_56">that street daily on his way towards his school and towards his home. She called and he came near.</div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s2_56">She kissed him – and he dropped as if dead just there. Then he had to be carried home.</div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s2_56">For one year continuously the kiss remained on him and he was in a coma. It may happen suddenly</div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s2_56">like this. Mm? This was a great transfer, and Babajan died afterwards because she had just been</div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s2_56">waiting for this moment to give someone the whole energy. This was her last life, and there was not</div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s2_56">enough time even to explain what she was giving. And also, she was not the type to have explained.</div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s2_56">She was a silent mystic. She had not touched anybody for years. She was a only waiting for this</div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s2_56">moment when she was to kiss someone and the whole energy was to be transferred in a single</div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s2_56">transfer. Before this she had not even touched anyone, so this touch was to be total.</div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s2_56">And this child was simply unaware of what was going to happen. He was ready – otherwise this</div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s2_56">transfer would not have been possible – but he was not aware. He had worked through his past</div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s2_56">lives. He was just coming up. He might have become aware later on, but just now he was completely</div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s2_56">unaware. This happened so suddenly that he had to go again through a second pregnancy. For one</div>
<div id="t14_56" class="t s2_56">year he was as if not. Many medicines were given; many, many doctors and physicians tried to help,</div>
<div id="t15_56" class="t s2_56">but nothing could be done. And the woman who could do something, she disappeared, she died.</div>
<div id="t16_56" class="t s2_56">After one year he was a different man – totally different.</div>
<div id="t17_56" class="t s2_56">If it happens so suddenly, then it will be a deep coma. If it happens through some exercises, then</div>
<div id="t18_56" class="t s2_56">it will never be so deep a coma. If you are doing awareness exercises, meditation, then it will never</div>
<div id="t19_56" class="t s2_56">happen so suddenly. It will come so gradually, so gradually, that you will never even become aware</div>
