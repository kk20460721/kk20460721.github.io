<div id="t1_127" class="t s1_127">Upanishads, it is written in the Vedas -- so what? We have already got all this; he is not </div>
<div id="t2_127" class="t s1_127">original." </div>
<div id="t3_127" class="t s1_127">And he was utterly original. It is NOT written in the Upanishads, and it is not written in </div>
<div id="t4_127" class="t s1_127">the Vedas, because in the first place it can't be written at all. Yes, the people who wrote </div>
<div id="t5_127" class="t s1_127">the Upanishads must have known it, but it is not written. </div>
<div id="t6_127" class="t s1_127">Hindus were very clever. They started writing commentaries on Buddha and they </div>
<div id="t7_127" class="t s1_127">distorted his whole philosophy. They created so much philosophical argument, so </div>
<div id="t8_127" class="t s1_127">much noise, that Buddha's still, small voice was lost, utterly lost. And the day he died, </div>
<div id="t9_127" class="t s1_127">Hindus created thirty-two schools of Buddhist philosophy; each word was interpreted </div>
<div id="ta_127" class="t s1_127">in thirty-two ways. They created so much confusion that the whole point was lost. </div>
<div id="tb_127" class="t s1_127">In fact, if they had crucified Buddha it would have been far better. Jesus was killed, but </div>
<div id="tc_127" class="t s1_127">Jews have not commented on Jesus at all. Once they killed him they thought, "Now it is </div>
<div id="td_127" class="t s1_127">finished and that is that!" They forgot all about Jesus, they never mentioned even his </div>
<div id="te_127" class="t s1_127">name in their scriptures. They never thought of writing any commentary on his </div>
<div id="tf_127" class="t s1_127">statements. They thought they have killed him and sooner or later people are going to </div>
<div id="tg_127" class="t s1_127">forget all about him and there is no problem left. </div>
<div id="th_127" class="t s1_127">In a way, Jesus' sayings have been saved far more accurately than Buddha's sayings, </div>
<div id="ti_127" class="t s1_127">because the brahmins, the clever and cunning brahmins who gathered around Buddha, </div>
<div id="tj_127" class="t s1_127">distorted everything that he was saying. It was distorted so much that if Buddha comes </div>
<div id="tk_127" class="t s1_127">back he will not be able to believe his own eyes what has happened. </div>
<div id="tl_127" class="t s1_127">But these people never come back. A buddha can only be here once. Once a person has </div>
<div id="tm_127" class="t s1_127">become a buddha or a christ, he evaporates and becomes a fragrance of the universe. He </div>
<div id="tn_127" class="t s1_127">cannot materialize again. </div>
<div id="to_127" class="t s1_127">Jesus may have promised because he had to leave his disciples so early. Nothing was </div>
<div id="tp_127" class="t s1_127">ready... the disciples were not ready -- not even a single disciple had yet become </div>
<div id="tq_127" class="t s1_127">enlightened. And they were at a loss what to do without the master. They had just come </div>
<div id="tr_127" class="t s1_127">close to him; only three years' time is not much. They have not yet imbibed his spirit. To </div>
<div id="ts_127" class="t s1_127">console them, to help them, to keep them integrated so they don't start falling apart, he </div>
<div id="tt_127" class="t s1_127">must have promised. He must have said, "Don't be worried, I will be coming back again </div>
<div id="tu_127" class="t s1_127">soon." </div>
<div id="tv_127" class="t s1_127">This promise was only a device. Remember, devices are neither true not false, they are </div>
<div id="tw_127" class="t s1_127">only devices. It was a device to keep the spirit in the disciples flowing, to keep them </div>
<div id="tx_127" class="t s1_127">integrated, to keep them confident, centered, rooted. It was simply a device! And it has </div>
<div id="ty_127" class="t s1_127">helped, the device has worked; otherwise there would have been no Christians at all. </div>
<div id="tz_127" class="t s1_127">Those poor disciples would have dispersed and slowly slowly would have forgotten all </div>
<div id="t10_127" class="t s1_127">about Jesus. That's what rabbis and the priests were thinking was going to happen. </div>
<div id="t11_127" class="t s1_127">But Jesus was far more insightful. He gave them a promise that, "Wait! Don't be </div>
<div id="t12_127" class="t s1_127">worried, I will be coming back. I cannot leave you, I will never leave you." </div>
<div id="t13_127" class="t s1_127">And this promise has helped in another way too: because this promise has been there, </div>
<div id="t14_127" class="t s1_127">the Christian mystic has been able to remember Christ far more concentratedly than a </div>
<div id="t15_127" class="t s1_127">Jaina can remember Mahavira -- because there is no promise. Mahavira has not said </div>
<div id="t16_127" class="t s1_127">that, "I will come back," he has not said, "I will help you," he has not said, "I will be </div>
