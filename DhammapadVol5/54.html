<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">psychoanalysis their religion, they have created their own trinity -- Freud, Adler, Jung. </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">They have created their own Bible, their own theology, now they are caught in it... it </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">happens. </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">When you have lived for centuries in prisons, even if you are allowed freedom you will </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">soon enter into another prison because that has become your habit. You cannot live </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">without chains. They have broken all the chains but they have now created new chains </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">of their own making, and when you make your own chains, handmade, homemade, </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">you are more attached to them. </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">Who bothers about what Buddha said? Twenty-five centuries have passed. Who cares </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">what Jesus said or did not say? In fact they have receded so far that nobody is really </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">obsessed with them, except a few people -- who are not contemporaries, who are still </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">living twenty centuries back. </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">But when you create your own chains and your own prisons... and psychoanalysis is </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">the latest religion -- it is very much easier to fall a victim to psychoanalysis, to Sigmund </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">Freud than to Jesus Christ; it is easier to believe in Marx than in Mohammed, than in </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">Mahavira, than in Manu, than in Moses, because he is so close to us, he speaks such a </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">contemporary language. And that's what has happened to the communists. The </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">Kremlin has become their Kaaba, their Kashi, their Kailash; they also have their own </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">trinity -- Marx, Engels, Lenin; they have their own Bible -- DAS KAPITAL. They have </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">their own apostles -- Stalin, Mao, Castro, Tito. And the same is happening to </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">psychoanalysis, it has become a new religion. </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">I hit psychoanalysts, Sarjana, because I love them. I am really interested in them. I </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">would like them to come and experience me, and to come and to know what is </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">happening here. And many have heard the call; out of all the professions, </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, psychologists, have received me the most deeply, the </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">most profoundly. Hundreds of them have come and become sannyasins. </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">And certainly I go on joking about them; those jokes are also my love affair. That's how </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">I show my love, my interest. </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">You say, "I have felt a deep sadness all day long stemming from your remarks today </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">about psychoanalysis and recalling your jokes over the years about psychiatrists." </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">You seem to have made a religion out of psychoanalysis yourself, that's why you feel </div>

<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">are so true. </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">Psychiatrists are crazy people, I mean beautiful people. Whenever I say that somebody </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">is crazy, I am appreciating them. You have to learn my language. Whenever I say that </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">somebody is crazy I mean that somebody is valuable. To be normal is not a very great </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">thing; to be normal is to be average. That is a condemnation, that somebody is just </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">normal; that means he has nothing in him, he is just hollow. </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">Don't feel sad, I am not against psychoanalysis -- although I would like psychoanalysts </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">to go beyond it. It has to be a stepping-stone. And whenever I see somebody clinging to </div>
<div id="t16_54" class="t s1_54">a stepping-stone I hit him hard to show him that there is something beyond. </div>
