<div id="t2_143" class="t s1_143">may happen to a few people, it may not happen to a few others. It may happen to you </div>
<div id="t3_143" class="t s1_143">one day, it may not happen to you another day. </div>
<div id="t4_143" class="t s1_143">Today you are feeling happy, you have met your woman, your friend, you are riding on </div>
<div id="t5_143" class="t s1_143">the winds. Somebody is singing a song, suddenly it strikes a note in you, you also feel </div>
<div id="t6_143" class="t s1_143">like singing. Somebody is dancing, your feet suddenly have the feel to dance, the mood </div>
<div id="t7_143" class="t s1_143">to dance. </div>
<div id="t8_143" class="t s1_143">But your wife has died, you are sad and somebody is singing and it hurts. The moon </div>
<div id="t9_143" class="t s1_143">has risen in the sky, a full-moon night, and you are sad -- the moon also looks sad, not </div>
<div id="ta_143" class="t s1_143">beautiful. You are in such a sad state that the full-moon night looks like it is ridiculing </div>
<div id="tb_143" class="t s1_143">you; it looks so indifferent to you, so unconcerned, so hard. You are in such a sad state </div>
<div id="tc_143" class="t s1_143">and the moon is still shining the same way it used to, and the roses are blooming and </div>
<div id="td_143" class="t s1_143">the birds are singing. Nobody seems to be concerned about you, nobody seems to care </div>
<div id="te_143" class="t s1_143">about you. </div>
<div id="tf_143" class="t s1_143">The universe seems to be very neutral, very cold. You feel hurt, you feel alienated, you </div>
<div id="tg_143" class="t s1_143">feel a stranger, an outsider. Now there will be no synchronicity. </div>
<div id="th_143" class="t s1_143">The law of synchronicity means sometimes you fit and sometimes you don't fit. It is </div>
<div id="ti_143" class="t s1_143">fluid. The law of synchronicity belongs to the world of mind; just as cause and effect </div>
<div id="tj_143" class="t s1_143">belong to the world of matter, body, the law of synchronicity belongs to the world of </div>
<div id="tk_143" class="t s1_143">mind, heart. Beyond these two there is a possibility of coincidence too. That means no </div>
<div id="tl_143" class="t s1_143">law pertains, or you can call it the law of freedom. That is the ultimate, the law of your </div>
<div id="tm_143" class="t s1_143">innermost core, in fact it is not a law because it is a law of freedom. Things can happen </div>
<div id="tn_143" class="t s1_143">which are not caused by anything and which are not created by the law of </div>
<div id="to_143" class="t s1_143">synchronicity, just coincidences. </div>
<div id="tp_143" class="t s1_143">Coincidence simply means that there is a possibility of freedom. Now there are people </div>
<div id="tq_143" class="t s1_143">here of all the three kinds. There are people here who have come according to the law of </div>
<div id="tr_143" class="t s1_143">cause and effect; they had to come, it was inevitable, unavoidable. There was something </div>
<div id="ts_143" class="t s1_143">pulling them like a magnet, they could not resist it. </div>
<div id="tt_143" class="t s1_143">There are people here who have come not through the law of cause and effect, but they </div>
<div id="tu_143" class="t s1_143">felt a synchronicity, a harmony with me, a deep accord. If they wanted to resist they </div>
<div id="tv_143" class="t s1_143">could have resisted very easily, if they wanted not to come they could have remained. </div>
<div id="tw_143" class="t s1_143">There was not some gravitational pull, they had to choose. It is out of their choice that </div>
<div id="tx_143" class="t s1_143">they are here. </div>
<div id="ty_143" class="t s1_143">And there is also the third category of people who have just come as a coincidence, </div>
<div id="tz_143" class="t s1_143">accidental. A friend was here, and you had come to see your friend, not to see me, not </div>
<div id="t10_143" class="t s1_143">to listen to me, not at all concerned about me; you had come just to see your friend -- </div>
<div id="t11_143" class="t s1_143">but then you got caught. The friend may not be here anymore, the friend may have </div>
<div id="t12_143" class="t s1_143">escaped. Now this is coincidence. </div>
<div id="t13_143" class="t s1_143">Your husband was coming here, and you simply followed him just as a dutiful wife. </div>
<div id="t14_143" class="t s1_143">Now there are many children, many kids who are coincidentally here. Their parents are </div>
<div id="t15_143" class="t s1_143">here, so they are here; their being here is not their choice, just a coincidence. Their </div>
<div id="t16_143" class="t s1_143">parents are Christian, they are Christian; their parents are Hindu, so they are Hindu; </div>
