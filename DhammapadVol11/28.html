<div id="t1_28" class="t s1_28">The story is that he made trees and mountains and rivers and animals. On the sixth day </div>
<div id="t2_28" class="t s1_28">he made man and since then he has not made anything. It seems man brought him to </div>
<div id="t3_28" class="t s1_28">his senses: "What are you doing?" He simply stopped absolutely. </div>
<div id="t4_28" class="t s1_28">But, Sujata, why do such questions bother YOU? It is none of your business! One thing </div>
<div id="t5_28" class="t s1_28">is certain: you have not made it, so why should you be worried? You are not </div>
<div id="t6_28" class="t s1_28">responsible, I am not responsible either -- I have not made it. So why should we waste </div>
<div id="t7_28" class="t s1_28">our time with it? There are many crazy people who have nothing else to do -- leave it </div>
<div id="t8_28" class="t s1_28">for them to think about. These are great subjects; one can go on thinking about them for </div>
<div id="t9_28" class="t s1_28">ever and ever; they are unending. That's why philosophy begins but never ends, </div>
<div id="ta_28" class="t s1_28">theology begins but never ends. It goes in circles. Each answer brings more questions </div>
<div id="tb_28" class="t s1_28">than it answers. </div>
<div id="tc_28" class="t s1_28">If I say, "Yes, God made it," then immediately many questions will arise: "Why did he </div>
<div id="td_28" class="t s1_28">make it in the first place? Why did he not ask us whether we wanted to be made or not? </div>
<div id="te_28" class="t s1_28">This seems to be such a dictatorial act, not democratic at all -- people are being made </div>
<div id="tf_28" class="t s1_28">without even asking them! And why did he make THIS kind of world when he is </div>
<div id="tg_28" class="t s1_28">omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient? He must have seen what was going to happen, </div>
<div id="th_28" class="t s1_28">he must have seen the future. He must have seen that there would be Genghis Khan </div>
<div id="ti_28" class="t s1_28">and Tamerlane and Adolf Hitler and Mussolini and Tojo; he must have seen all these </div>
<div id="tj_28" class="t s1_28">people. He must have seen that man would fight thousands of wars. He must have seen </div>
<div id="tk_28" class="t s1_28">that sooner or later man would discover atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and </div>
<div id="tl_28" class="t s1_28">deathrays and whatnot. Then why did he create this world? Is he a sadist? Is he </div>
<div id="tm_28" class="t s1_28">enjoying all this misery? And millions of people live in such misery -- and what does he </div>
<div id="tn_28" class="t s1_28">go on doing? Can't he come and help?" </div>
<div id="to_28" class="t s1_28">In scriptures it is said... in the SRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA Krishna declares: I will </div>
<div id="tp_28" class="t s1_28">come whenever there is too much misery. Is it not enough, the misery that man is living </div>
<div id="tq_28" class="t s1_28">in now? When is he going to come? And what did he do when he really came? He </div>
<div id="tr_28" class="t s1_28">didn't help anybody. In fact, in his days the greatest war in India was fought. If we </div>
<div id="ts_28" class="t s1_28">believe the scriptures, so many people died in that war... the whole of India could not </div>
<div id="tt_28" class="t s1_28">have contained so many people. Even now the whole world contains only three times as </div>

<div id="ty_28" class="t s1_28">seems to have been saved. Jesus could not even save himself -- he was crucified! The </div>
<div id="tz_28" class="t s1_28">savior was crucified by those for whom he had come; he had come to save them. </div>
<div id="t10_28" class="t s1_28">Thousands of questions will arise. Leave these questions to mad people. </div>
