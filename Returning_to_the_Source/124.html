<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">CHAPTER 9. HE DID NOT FEEL IT SO DEEPLY</div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s2_124">One woman came and I told her the story.</div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s2_124">She said: I don’t believe it at all – a very educated</div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s2_124">woman, she had a Ph.D. from some university, and thought herself an atheist. I said: That is not the</div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s2_124">point, this night will prove it. She said: But, I don’t believe! I said: That’s very good. We don’t force</div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s2_124">belief, but it is just our duty to make you aware that this is going to happen. It always happens.</div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s2_124">At twelve in the night I went to sleep, and just when I had put the light out, she screamed. I went in, I</div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s2_124">looked at her – she was completely unconscious, she had fainted. The moment she went to her bed</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s2_124">and put the light out, the man did his thing exactly at the right moment. It took four or ﬁve minutes</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s2_124">for her to come to. She would look at the corner of the room, close her eyes and faint again!</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s2_124">The whole night I had to wait on her. In the morning she was still feverish. I said: There are no</div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s2_124">ghosts, don’t be bothered. She said: Now I cannot say. The woman was just standing in the corner</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s2_124">gnashing her teeth, one-eyed and wearing a red sari. I have seen her!</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s2_124">This was a joke in the beginning, and the whole family with whom I lived all knew. But by and by, they</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s2_124">also became afraid. They said: But when it happens to so many people, there must be something</div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s2_124">in it. Nobody would sleep in that room, not even the man who crunched his teeth. He said: No, I</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s2_124">cannot sleep. Maybe something is there. Maybe because of that woman I crunch my teeth, because</div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s2_124">the doctors say nothing is wrong. Maybe she forces me, or it is something she is doing.</div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s2_124">A time came when if somebody needed something from that room, they would come to me. ’You go,</div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s2_124">because nobody else is ready to...’</div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s2_124">A few years ago, I visited the room. They had locked it because they said that when I left, nobody</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s2_124">was ready to enter that room. And sometimes now in the night, even though that man who used to</div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s2_124">crunch is no more, that sound is heard.</div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s2_124">People project; that’s why so many ghosts exist. It doesn’t depend on reality, it depends on your</div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s2_124">mind.</div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s2_124">If you are afraid, you create something through your fear; a counterpart will immediately</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s2_124">come into reality. If you love, you create something; a counterpart immediately comes into reality.</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s2_124">You live in a shell of your own mind, it covers you like a capsule.</div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s2_124">So remember, there is not one world; there are as many worlds as there are minds. If in a home</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s2_124">there are ﬁve people, there are ﬁve worlds. That’s why it is so difﬁcult to communicate – because</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s2_124">the other lives in his own world and you live in yours. It is difﬁcult to penetrate.</div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s2_124">The town was not the town of his childhood, it was not his birthplace. They were playing a joke.</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s2_124">They said: THIS IS THE CAPITAL OF YEN. THE OLD MAN COMPOSED HIMSELF AND LOOKED</div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s2_124">SOLEMN. INSIDE THE CITY, THEY POINTED OUT A SHRINE: THIS IS THE SHRINE OF YOUR</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s2_124">QUARTER – this is the temple, your parents worshipped here, and you were initiated a Buddhist</div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s2_124">in this shrine.</div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s2_124">HE BREATHED A DEEP SIGH. THEY POINTED OUT A HUT: THIS WAS YOUR</div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s2_124">FATHER’S COTTAGE. TEARS WELLED UP. They are creating a world around him. THEY POINTED</div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s2_124">OUT A MOUND: THIS IS YOUR FATHER’S TOMB. HE COULD NOT HELP WEEPING ALOUD.</div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s2_124">They have created a world, they have given him a screen, and all his projections have been brought</div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s2_124">out. HIS COMPANIONS ROARED WITH LAUGHTER: WE ARE TEASING YOU – YOU ARE STILL</div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s2_124">Returning to the Source</div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s2_124">124</div>
