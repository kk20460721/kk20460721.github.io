<div id="t1_141" class="t s1_141">almost ninety-nine percent of diseases are beliefs. Maybe it was a real disease the first </div>
<div id="t2_141" class="t s1_141">time, but then you started believing in it, you started projecting it, you started repeating </div>
<div id="t3_141" class="t s1_141">it, rehearsing it, practicing it. And slowly slowly, it became a reality for you. </div>
<div id="t4_141" class="t s1_141">Go into an insane asylum sometime and watch people. They are the same people as </div>
<div id="t5_141" class="t s1_141">you, just a little ahead of you -- the difference is only of degrees. You may be below the </div>
<div id="t6_141" class="t s1_141">boiling point, maybe ninety-nine degrees, and they may have gone beyond -- one </div>
<div id="t7_141" class="t s1_141">hundred and one degrees -- just a two-degree difference or a one-degree difference. </div>
<div id="t8_141" class="t s1_141">Insane people go on living in their own worlds; they create their own worlds, they </div>
<div id="t9_141" class="t s1_141">believe in their own worlds. They believe in them so much that you cannot pull them </div>
<div id="ta_141" class="t s1_141">out of their dreams. Their dreams have become realities -- that is their insanity. </div>
<div id="tb_141" class="t s1_141">I have heard about one man who became mad and started thinking that he had died. </div>
<div id="tc_141" class="t s1_141">Now the whole psychological department of that mental institute was after him to pull </div>
<div id="td_141" class="t s1_141">him out of the idea that he was dead. It was a challenge for them, it was also something </div>
<div id="te_141" class="t s1_141">new -- they had never come across such a case. </div>
<div id="tf_141" class="t s1_141">They tried everything but it was impossible, because mad people may be mad but they </div>
<div id="tg_141" class="t s1_141">are as logical as you are. They have their own logic, their own rationality; they have a </div>
<div id="th_141" class="t s1_141">great capacity to rationalize everything that they are doing. </div>
<div id="ti_141" class="t s1_141">Finally, a great psychologist was called from the outside to help. The great psychologist </div>
<div id="tj_141" class="t s1_141">came; he talked to the man and he asked him one single question. He asked, "Do you </div>
<div id="tk_141" class="t s1_141">believe that dead men can bleed?" </div>
<div id="tl_141" class="t s1_141">He said, "No, never! How can dead men bleed? Once one is dead... it is impossible for a </div>
<div id="tm_141" class="t s1_141">corpse to bleed." </div>
<div id="tn_141" class="t s1_141">Then the psychologist said, "Come along with me!" He took him to the mirror; he </div>
<div id="to_141" class="t s1_141">pricked his hand with a sharp instrument -- blood started coming out. He said, "Look! </div>
<div id="tp_141" class="t s1_141">So this proves that you are still alive!" </div>
<div id="tq_141" class="t s1_141">The madman laughed and he said, "This only proves that my statement was wrong -- </div>
<div id="tr_141" class="t s1_141">dead men DO bleed!" </div>
<div id="ts_141" class="t s1_141">It becomes so impossible to pull them out! And the same is the case with you. As far as </div>
<div id="tt_141" class="t s1_141">buddhas are concerned, the same is the case with you. To pull you outside your minds, </div>
<div id="tu_141" class="t s1_141">to help you to climb out of your dreams -- it is really difficult. </div>
<div id="tv_141" class="t s1_141">Hypnosis tries one method, but that is not the method of the buddhas. It gives you </div>
<div id="tw_141" class="t s1_141">another dream, maybe a better one -- a little more sophisticated, a little less dangerous, </div>
<div id="tx_141" class="t s1_141">less harmful, more beneficial -- but a dream is still a dream. Whether you dream of </div>
<div id="ty_141" class="t s1_141">poison or of nectar does not really make much difference; at least it makes no difference </div>
<div id="tz_141" class="t s1_141">to the man who has become awakened. </div>
<div id="t10_141" class="t s1_141">Ordinarily it will make a difference: a man who believes that he is drinking poison will </div>
<div id="t11_141" class="t s1_141">always remain ill; the man who thinks that he is drinking nectar will always look </div>
<div id="t12_141" class="t s1_141">healthy, joyful. Yes, in the ordinary way there is a difference. Hence hypnosis has a </div>
<div id="t13_141" class="t s1_141">limited utility: if you cannot be pulled out of your dreams, at least you can be helped to </div>
<div id="t14_141" class="t s1_141">move from nightmares to sweet dreams. That's the function of hypnosis. </div>
