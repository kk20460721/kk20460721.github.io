<div id="t5_536" class="t s2_536">depends on the questioner.</div>
<div id="t6_536" class="t s2_536">Buddha enters a village.</div>
<div id="t7_536" class="t s2_536">One man asks, ”Is there God?” Buddha says, ”No.” In the afternoon,</div>
<div id="t8_536" class="t s2_536">another man asks, ”Is there God?” Buddha says, ”Yes.” Then in the evening, a third one asks, ”Is</div>
<div id="t9_536" class="t s2_536">there God?” Buddha remains silent. In just one day: in the morning, no; in the afternoon, yes; in the</div>
<div id="ta_536" class="t s2_536">evening, silence – neither yes nor no.</div>
<div id="tb_536" class="t s2_536">Buddha’s disciple, Anand, became puzzled.</div>
<div id="tc_536" class="t s2_536">He had heard all three answers.</div>
<div id="td_536" class="t s2_536">In the night when</div>
<div id="te_536" class="t s2_536">everyone had retired, he asked Buddha, ”Can I ask you a question?</div>
<div id="tf_536" class="t s2_536">Just in one day you have</div>
<div id="tg_536" class="t s2_536">answered one question in three ways, not only differently, contradictorily.</div>
<div id="th_536" class="t s2_536">My mind is puzzled.</div>
<div id="ti_536" class="t s2_536">I</div>
<div id="tj_536" class="t s2_536">cannot sleep if you don’t answer. What do you mean? In the morning you say yes, in the afternoon</div>
<div id="tk_536" class="t s2_536">no, in the evening you remain silent.</div>
<div id="tl_536" class="t s2_536">And the question was the same.” Buddha said, ”But the</div>
<div id="tm_536" class="t s2_536">questioners were different.</div>
<div id="tn_536" class="t s2_536">And how can different questioners ask the same question?” This is</div>
<div id="to_536" class="t s2_536">really beautiful, very deep.</div>
<div id="tp_536" class="t s2_536">He said, ”How can different questioners ask the same question?</div>
<div id="tq_536" class="t s2_536">A</div>
<div id="tr_536" class="t s2_536">question comes out of a being, it is a growth. If the being is different, how can the question be the</div>
<div id="ts_536" class="t s2_536">same? In the morning when I said yes, the man who was asking was an atheist. He had come</div>
<div id="tt_536" class="t s2_536">to get my conﬁrmation that there is no God. And I could not conﬁrm his atheism, because he was</div>
<div id="tu_536" class="t s2_536">suffering because of it. And because I could not be a part in his suffering, and I wanted to help him,</div>
<div id="tv_536" class="t s2_536">I said, ”Yes, God exists.” That’s how I tried to destroy his so-called atheism. In the afternoon, when</div>
<div id="tw_536" class="t s2_536">the other person was there, he was a theist and he was suffering through his theism. I couldn’t say</div>
<div id="tx_536" class="t s2_536">yes to him because that would have been a conﬁrmation – which he had come for. Then he would</div>
<div id="ty_536" class="t s2_536">go and say, ‘Yes, whatsoever I was saying is right. Even Buddha says so.’ And the man was wrong.</div>
<div id="tz_536" class="t s2_536">I could not help a wrong man in his wrongness so I had to say no to destroy whatsoever he is, to</div>
<div id="t10_536" class="t s2_536">shatter his mind. And the man who came in the evening was neither. He was a simple, innocent man</div>
<div id="t11_536" class="t s2_536">and he was not asking for any conﬁrmation. He had no ideology; he was really a religious person.</div>
<div id="t12_536" class="t s2_536">So I had to be silent. I said to him, ”Be silent about this question. Don’t think about it.” If I had said</div>
<div id="t13_536" class="t s2_536">yes, it would have been wrong because he was not there to ﬁnd a theology. If I had said no, it would</div>
<div id="t14_536" class="t s2_536">have been wrong, because he was not to be conﬁrmed in any atheism. He was not interested in</div>
<div id="t15_536" class="t s2_536">thoughts, in ideas, in theories, doctrines, no; he was a real religious man. How can I utter any word</div>
<div id="t16_536" class="t s2_536">before him? I had to be silent. He understood my silence. When he went away, his religiousness</div>
<div id="t17_536" class="t s2_536">had deepened.”</div>
<div id="t18_536" class="t s2_536">Buddha said, ”Three persons cannot ask the same question. They can formulate it in a similar way</div>
<div id="t19_536" class="t s2_536">– that is another thing. The questions were all ”Does God exist?” Their formulation was the same,</div>
<div id="t1a_536" class="t s2_536">but the being from where the question was coming was totally different. They meant different things</div>
<div id="t1b_536" class="t s2_536">by it; their values were different; their associations with words were different.”</div>
<div id="t1c_536" class="t s2_536">I remember, once it happened that Mulla Nasruddin came back to his house one evening. The whole</div>
<div id="t1d_536" class="t s2_536">day he had been involved in a football match. He was a fan. IN the evening when he entered the</div>
<div id="t1e_536" class="t s2_536">house, his wife was reading a newspaper, and she said, ”Look, Nasruddin, there is something for</div>
<div id="t1f_536" class="t s2_536">you. It is reported here that a man has given his wife in return for a season ticket for the football</div>
<div id="t1g_536" class="t s2_536">matches. You are also a fan, a mad fan, but I cannot conceive that you would do the same. Or would</div>
<div id="t1h_536" class="t s2_536">you? Could you exchange me just to get a season ticket for the football matches?”</div>
<div id="t1i_536" class="t s2_536">Nasruddin thought hard, and then he said, ”Of course I would not – because it is ridiculous and</div>
