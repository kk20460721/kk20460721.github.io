<div id="t1_185" class="t s1_185">There are almost fifty percent Jews here. This may be the only place in India where </div>
<div id="t2_185" class="t s1_185">there are so many Jews, because in India there are not any Jews, none at all. And if </div>
<div id="t3_185" class="t s1_185">things go on growing as they are growing, soon you will find another Israel here! And </div>
<div id="t4_185" class="t s1_185">why are Jews coming? -- because they are intelligent, they are always ready to accept </div>
<div id="t5_185" class="t s1_185">anything new and they are ready to drop the old. </div>
<div id="t6_185" class="t s1_185">In fact, seeing the intelligence of the Jews it seems almost unbelievable that they killed </div>
<div id="t7_185" class="t s1_185">Jesus. The more I have come in contact with the Jews -- and I have thousands of Jews as </div>
<div id="t8_185" class="t s1_185">my sannyasins -- the more I have become puzzled about the phenomenon. Why could </div>
<div id="t9_185" class="t s1_185">they not accept Jesus? Maybe it was not really the Jews who killed him but the Roman </div>
<div id="ta_185" class="t s1_185">emperor, Roman imperialism. Romans have always been cruel and they have not </div>
<div id="tb_185" class="t s1_185">proved themselves very intelligent either. It may have been just that Jews were used as </div>
<div id="tc_185" class="t s1_185">an excuse and the Romans wanted to kill Jesus. </div>
<div id="td_185" class="t s1_185">And the Jews were not independent people in those days, they were part of the Roman </div>
<div id="te_185" class="t s1_185">Empire. It is possible that the Romans used the Jewish priests as a facade, because they </div>
<div id="tf_185" class="t s1_185">would not have liked to kill Jesus directly -- that may have created a revolution in the </div>
<div id="tg_185" class="t s1_185">country, a rebellion. It is a simple diplomacy to use Jews themselves to kill Jesus; then </div>
<div id="th_185" class="t s1_185">there will be no rebellion, no revolution, no problems arising. </div>
<div id="ti_185" class="t s1_185">In fact, they pretended on the surface that they were not interested in killing Jesus, and </div>
<div id="tj_185" class="t s1_185">from the back door they may have insisted. To the public they showed that "We are </div>
<div id="tk_185" class="t s1_185">absolutely out of the game. If Jews want to kill him, they can kill him; if they don't want </div>
<div id="tl_185" class="t s1_185">to kill him we are ready to forgive him." And from the back they may have been </div>
<div id="tm_185" class="t s1_185">goading the Jews to kill Jesus. That's more possible, because Jews are not such </div>
<div id="tn_185" class="t s1_185">unintelligent people that they would destroy their own greatest flowering. </div>
<div id="to_185" class="t s1_185">Jesus was their greatest flowering. He was the climax of the Judaic approach to life. </div>
<div id="tp_185" class="t s1_185">Jesus was born a Jew and died a Jew -- he was not a Christian, remember; he has not </div>
<div id="tq_185" class="t s1_185">even heard the word 'christian'. And if he comes back he will find himself more in tune </div>
<div id="tr_185" class="t s1_185">with the Jews than with the Christians, because he lived the life of a Jew. He was well </div>
<div id="ts_185" class="t s1_185">acquainted with Jewish scriptures, he quoted Jewish scriptures. He said again and again </div>
<div id="tt_185" class="t s1_185">that "Whatsoever has been said before by other prophets I am saying to you" -- giving it </div>
<div id="tu_185" class="t s1_185">a more contemporary expression, of course, but he was not against Moses, Abraham, </div>
<div id="tv_185" class="t s1_185">Ezekiel. He was not against the old prophets; he was fulfilling their prophecies, he was </div>
<div id="tw_185" class="t s1_185">the very fulfillment. </div>
<div id="tx_185" class="t s1_185">Why should Jews kill him? There is every possibility that the Romans did it. They were </div>
<div id="ty_185" class="t s1_185">afraid of his growing power. </div>
<div id="tz_185" class="t s1_185">The political powers always become afraid of anybody who starts becoming powerful </div>
<div id="t10_185" class="t s1_185">in any way. Although Jesus was not interested in politics, not interested in political </div>
<div id="t11_185" class="t s1_185">power, his language could be misinterpreted very easily. He was talking about the </div>
<div id="t12_185" class="t s1_185">kingdom of God, but the Romans started thinking that he is talking of bringing the </div>
<div id="t13_185" class="t s1_185">kingdom of Jews; he wants to become the emperor himself. They must have been </div>
<div id="t14_185" class="t s1_185">apprehensive of his growing popularity. </div>
<div id="t15_185" class="t s1_185">Many many people were turning to him, coming to him, listening to him, becoming </div>
<div id="t16_185" class="t s1_185">disciples, becoming initiates. Of course it was a religion now, but any moment religion </div>
