<div id="t1_20" class="t s1_20">CHAPTER 1. THE SECRET OF SHAPES, SOUNDS AND FRAGRANCES</div>
<div id="t2_20" class="t s2_20">anything to do with a person called Mahavira. If you know he is in your village, run to another. If he</div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s2_20">passes your way on the road, hide somewhere on a side street. And if without realizing it you are</div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s2_20">somewhere where you can hear his words, close you beware of him!”</div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s2_20">When the son asked him why he should be so afraid of Mahavira, his father told him not to argue:</div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s2_20">”Just listen to what I say. If you go near that man our business will be in danger and the family will</div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s2_20">starve.”</div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s2_20">What happens next is very interesting. The son of that thief always ran away from Mahavira, but</div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s2_20">one day he made a mistake. Mahavira was sitting silently in a mango grove, and, unknowingly, the</div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s2_20">thief’s son happened to pass that way. Suddenly yyhavira started speaking. The thief heard half the</div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s2_20">sentence, closed his ears and ran. But he had already heard half the sentence, and that landed him</div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s2_20">in a lot of trouble</div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s2_20">....</div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s2_20">He was being chased by the police – the whole state police were after him for</div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s2_20">his thieving – and after a few weeks he was eventually caught.</div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s2_20">Thieving was in his family and so he was an expert in his trade. He was so clever that he never left</div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s2_20">behind any incriminating evidence. It was well known that he was a thief and had committed a lot of</div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s2_20">thefts; everybody knew about it, but there was no evidence. So there was no alternative but to make</div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s2_20">him confess.</div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s2_20">He was made totally drunk and kept in such a state of intoxication that he remained unconscious for</div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s2_20">two or three days. When he did open his eyes again, he was still in a state of semi-consciousness.</div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s2_20">All around him he say beautiful women standing and he asked where he was.</div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s2_20">He was told that</div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s2_20">he had died, and that preparations were being made to take him either to heaven or hell. He was</div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s2_20">told that people were waiting for him to become conscious so that he could confess the sins he’d</div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s2_20">committed. If he did, he would be taken to heaven; otherwise he would be sent to hell. If he spoke</div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s2_20">the truth he would be saved.</div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s2_20">He felt that now he should tell the truth and not lose the chance of going to heaven; now that he had</div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s2_20">died there was nothing to fear. But just at that moment he remembered that half-sentence he had</div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s2_20">heard Mahavira say. Mahavira had been talking about gods and ghosts. He had also hinted about</div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s2_20">the yamadoots, who take people to the worlds beyond death. The thief had heard him say that the</div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s2_20">toes of yamadoots are always inverted: he opened his eyes and saw that the feet of the people</div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s2_20">standing by him were normal, so he became alert. He now saw there was no need to confess. He</div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s2_20">saw through the trick, and said that he had not committed any sins; what could he confess? If they</div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s2_20">wanted they could take him to hell. But as he hadn’t committed any sins, how could they? So they</div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s2_20">had to let him go.</div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s2_20">He went running to Mahavira, fell at his feet, and asked him to complete the sentence which had</div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s2_20">saved him. When half of Mahavira’s sentence had saved him, of how much more beneﬁt would be</div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s2_20">the whole sentence! He said he was totally surrendered to Mahavira. Sometime or other he was</div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s2_20">bound to be caught and hanged but if he heard the rest of the sentence he might still be saved.</div>
<div id="t15_20" class="t s2_20">So Mahavira used to say that even if half the sentence of an awakened one was heard, it could be</div>
<div id="t16_20" class="t s2_20">useful one day.</div>
<div id="t17_20" class="t s2_20">Similarly, a man running past a temple, or just passing by casually, hears the sound vibrations</div>
<div id="t18_20" class="t s2_20">coming from a temple or smells the fragrance of the place... and even that can be of help to him.</div>
<div id="t19_20" class="t s2_20">Hidden Mysteries</div>
<div id="t1a_20" class="t s2_20">20</div>
<div id="t1b_20" class="t s3_20">Osho</div>
