<div id="t1_25" class="t s1_25">The principal suggested they send him to a Yeshiva. The Goldbergs did, but after a few </div>
<div id="t2_25" class="t s1_25">weeks he was expelled. </div>
<div id="t3_25" class="t s1_25">The Goldbergs knew that Catholic parochial schools were very strict, so they decided to </div>
<div id="t4_25" class="t s1_25">send Jake to one. They enrolled him in Christ-the-King School for Boys, and warned </div>
<div id="t5_25" class="t s1_25">their son to behave and to do his lessons, because this was his last chance. If he was </div>
<div id="t6_25" class="t s1_25">thrown out now he would be sent to a school for delinquents. </div>
<div id="t7_25" class="t s1_25">After a week of parochial school, Jake came home with terrific grades. Miraculously he </div>
<div id="t8_25" class="t s1_25">had been converted into a well-behaved, serious student. </div>
<div id="t9_25" class="t s1_25">"How come you changed all of a sudden?" asked Goldberg. </div>
<div id="ta_25" class="t s1_25">"Well," he answered, "when I saw some man hanging on a cross in every room, I figured </div>
<div id="tb_25" class="t s1_25">I had better not be a wise guy anymore." </div>
<div id="tc_25" class="t s1_25">Make people afraid, keep them always trembling. Let them know that God is </div>
<div id="td_25" class="t s1_25">dictatorial, a very angry God, jealous, and is absolutely unable to forgive if you disobey. </div>
<div id="te_25" class="t s1_25">Disobedience is the greatest sin in the eyes of the priests; hence Adam and Eve were </div>
<div id="tf_25" class="t s1_25">expelled. They had not done much of a sin. What had they really done? Nothing much </div>
<div id="tg_25" class="t s1_25">to talk about, but priests have been talking about it for centuries. And God was so angry </div>
<div id="th_25" class="t s1_25">that not only Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden, paradise -- with </div>
<div id="ti_25" class="t s1_25">them the whole humanity! </div>
<div id="tj_25" class="t s1_25">You are suffering because Adam and Eve disobeyed. You have not done anything </div>
<div id="tk_25" class="t s1_25">wrong; you are suffering for their sin because you are descendants. The sin is so great -- </div>
<div id="tl_25" class="t s1_25">not only the persons are punished, but for thousands and thousands of years their </div>
<div id="tm_25" class="t s1_25">descendants have to be punished too. </div>
<div id="tn_25" class="t s1_25">And what was the sin really? Why is so much fuss made about it? It was so innocent, it </div>
<div id="to_25" class="t s1_25">was so natural, that I cannot conceive how Adam and Eve could have avoided it. If </div>
<div id="tp_25" class="t s1_25">anybody is responsible for it, God himself is responsible. There were millions of trees in </div>
<div id="tq_25" class="t s1_25">the Garden of Eden and there was only one tree which God did not want Adam and </div>
<div id="tr_25" class="t s1_25">Eve to eat from -- only one tree, the forbidden. And the reason why it was forbidden </div>
<div id="ts_25" class="t s1_25">also seems to be very ugly. The reason is: if you eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge, </div>
<div id="tt_25" class="t s1_25">you will become like God and God is very jealous. Look at the reason why the tree was </div>
<div id="tu_25" class="t s1_25">prohibited. The reason is that if you eat from the tree, from this tree, the tree of </div>
<div id="tv_25" class="t s1_25">knowledge, you will become immortal, like gods. You will know as much as God </div>
<div id="tw_25" class="t s1_25">knows -- and that is intolerable! So God has protected that tree especially for himself -- </div>
<div id="tx_25" class="t s1_25">he must be eating from the tree of knowledge -- and prohibited Adam and Eve. </div>
<div id="ty_25" class="t s1_25">Now this is exactly what every father goes on doing. He smokes and he prohibits the </div>
<div id="tz_25" class="t s1_25">children: "Don't smoke -- this is bad. This is bad for you!" But because the father looks </div>
<div id="t10_25" class="t s1_25">so beautiful smoking, the children become enchanted. They would also like to be like </div>
<div id="t11_25" class="t s1_25">the father -- and he looks so manly when he is puffing on his cigar, he looks so proud! </div>
<div id="t12_25" class="t s1_25">He never looks so proud as when he is puffing on his cigar, resting in his chair, reading </div>
<div id="t13_25" class="t s1_25">the newspaper. The children become attracted. When the father is not there they also sit </div>
<div id="t14_25" class="t s1_25">on the same chair, spread the same newspaper, although they cannot read, and start </div>
<div id="t15_25" class="t s1_25">puffing. And it gives them great joy because it gives them great ego. </div>
<div id="t16_25" class="t s1_25">In fact, to prohibit is to invite. To say to children, "Don't do it!" is to ask for trouble. </div>
