<div id="t1_7" class="t s1_7">That is the most important part in it: hanging from a cliff, let go.</div>
<div id="t2_7" class="t s1_7">That is accepting death of the ego. But don't do it with effort, with tension. Don't do it to</div>
<div id="t3_7" class="t s1_7">achieve anything based on greed or ambition; just do it simply to discover your real self. The</div>
<div id="t4_7" class="t s1_7">right way of doing is ... agree to accept the experience.</div>
<div id="t5_7" class="t s1_7">Yuan Wu tells Ta Hui: You have not agreed to accept the experience, so only the first half</div>
<div id="t6_7" class="t s1_7">is complete. The ego has died and has left you in a limbo, because you have not been</div>
<div id="t7_7" class="t s1_7">absolutely total in your let-go. Let-go you managed -- but it was a managed let-go, it was not a</div>
<div id="t8_7" class="t s1_7">spontaneous acceptance. You have not enjoyed the let-go. If you had enjoyed, then:</div>
<div id="t9_7" class="t s1_7">AFTER ANNIHILATION, COME BACK TO LIFE --</div>
<div id="ta_7" class="t s1_7">I COULD NOT DECEIVE YOU.</div>
<div id="tb_7" class="t s1_7">He was a man of few words. It is unfortunate ... very rarely a few people become</div>
<div id="tc_7" class="t s1_7">enlightened, but out of those few the major part never say anything. The few who say anything</div>
<div id="td_7" class="t s1_7">say only fragments, and in a language ... unless you are enlightened it will not be possible to</div>
<div id="te_7" class="t s1_7">comprehend their meaning. And a few never say a single word. They don't leave any trace on</div>
<div id="tf_7" class="t s1_7">the sands of this bank, of this shore; they simply disappear into the other shore.</div>
<div id="tg_7" class="t s1_7">Ta Hui, hearing this saying from the master Yuan Wu, hanging from a cliff, let-go -- and</div>
<div id="th_7" class="t s1_7">agree to accept the experience ... If you can manage this falling into the abyss as a celebration,</div>
<div id="ti_7" class="t s1_7">with a joyful heart, then after annihilation, come back to life -- then there is no problem: you</div>
<div id="tj_7" class="t s1_7">will come back to life. In fact, what you used to think of as life was not life; now you will</div>
<div id="tk_7" class="t s1_7">come to the eternal life. But the bridge between the two is total acceptance.</div>
<div id="tl_7" class="t s1_7">Yuan Wu must have seen in the eyes of Ta Hui some doubt, some question mark. That's</div>
<div id="tm_7" class="t s1_7">why he adds, "I could not deceive you."</div>
<div id="tn_7" class="t s1_7">Ta Hui remained with Master Yuan Wu; he fell in love with the master. When the master</div>
<div id="to_7" class="t s1_7">could even see in his mind just a little doubt, and had to say, "I could not deceive you," it was</div>
<div id="tp_7" class="t s1_7">clear that he had come to the right man, who could look into his very being and could say in</div>
<div id="tq_7" class="t s1_7">exact words what had happened to him. Half of his journey was over, but because he had not</div>
<div id="tr_7" class="t s1_7">been in a total accepting mood, the half had been incomplete ..."Now accept totally, and</div>
<div id="ts_7" class="t s1_7">resurrection will happen on its own."</div>
<div id="tt_7" class="t s1_7">Naturally Ta Hui would have doubted; that is the nature of intellect, to doubt, and he was a</div>
<div id="tu_7" class="t s1_7">very intelligent man, young, fresh, and belonging to the genius category. He must have</div>
<div id="tv_7" class="t s1_7">realized that the master had even seen the unexpressed doubt in his mind, and that is why he is</div>
<div id="tw_7" class="t s1_7">saying, "I could not deceive you."</div>
<div id="tx_7" class="t s1_7">He remained with the master. Listening to the master, imbibing his spirit, his presence,</div>
<div id="ty_7" class="t s1_7">slowly, slowly he became very articulate, although enlightenment perhaps was still far away ...</div>
<div id="tz_7" class="t s1_7">And it became even farther away, because he started receiving honors from the people -- even</div>
<div id="t10_7" class="t s1_7">from the emperor, from the government -- as a realized man. These are very dangerous things.</div>
<div id="t11_7" class="t s1_7">When you are not realized and the government recognizes you, and great honors are conferred</div>
<div id="t12_7" class="t s1_7">on you, you can get into a deluded state about yourself. You can start thinking, "Perhaps I am</div>
<div id="t13_7" class="t s1_7">enlightened."</div>
<div id="t14_7" class="t s1_7">Two things can do this. One: he has learned in moving from master to master everything</div>
<div id="t15_7" class="t s1_7">that Zen teaching is. So if you listen only to his words, it is very difficult for you to find that</div>
<div id="t16_7" class="t s1_7">Chapter 1 - Clear the mind</div>
<div id="t17_7" class="t s1_7">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t18_7" class="t s1_7">7</div>
