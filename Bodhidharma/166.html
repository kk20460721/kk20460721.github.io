<div id="t1_166" class="t s1_166">are showing respect for the living god. These things are immaterial -- -whether </div>
<div id="t2_166" class="t s1_166">you are a friend or a stranger or an enemy. </div>
<div id="t3_166" class="t s1_166">And secondly, the folded hands show that I am not halfhearted in my greeting. I </div>
<div id="t4_166" class="t s1_166">am total. Both hands, my left hemisphere, my right hemisphere both, are </div>
<div id="t5_166" class="t s1_166">greeting you together. I am greeting you as one organic unity. </div>
<div id="t6_166" class="t s1_166">But I was surprised that the TIMES OF INDIA press people -- who are well </div>
<div id="t7_166" class="t s1_166">educated, who own the biggest newspapers, magazines, weeklies, fortnightlies </div>
<div id="t8_166" class="t s1_166">who are all journalists -- they could not respond to me. They sat there like stone </div>
<div id="t9_166" class="t s1_166">statues, even Indu Jain. </div>
<div id="ta_166" class="t s1_166">The only man who responded to me was Samir Jain, who is now in charge of the </div>
<div id="tb_166" class="t s1_166">TIMES OF INDIA publications, and his sister, Nandita Jain. But she could not </div>
<div id="tc_166" class="t s1_166">come to the full greeting. She was hesitating, so she came halfway. She could not </div>
<div id="td_166" class="t s1_166">come to the full greeting, but she could not remain a wooden statue. She looked </div>
<div id="te_166" class="t s1_166">to both sides. Even her mother, Indu Jain, who in private touches my feet, but in </div>
<div id="tf_166" class="t s1_166">public ...she remained just a wooden statue. So she looked at her mother and she </div>
<div id="tg_166" class="t s1_166">looked at her brother and she chose the middle way. She just came halfway. </div>
<div id="th_166" class="t s1_166">To speak to such people is almost worse than speaking to a wall. I took the </div>
<div id="ti_166" class="t s1_166">initiative of greeting them and they were not even human enough to respond to </div>
<div id="tj_166" class="t s1_166">the greeting, and particularly in the East, such ugliness is unforgivable. And they </div>
<div id="tk_166" class="t s1_166">have been insisting on the interview. I was reluctant -- reluctant for the simple </div>
<div id="tl_166" class="t s1_166">reason that they would ask stupid questions, then they would distort what I say. </div>
<div id="tm_166" class="t s1_166">But when I saw that they had come with the whole staff of the TIMES OF INDIA </div>
<div id="tn_166" class="t s1_166">press, I agreed. </div>
<div id="to_166" class="t s1_166">But I really agreed for Samir Jain. He is a young man, he has been to the ashram </div>
<div id="tp_166" class="t s1_166">before, he has meditated. He wanted to become a sannyasin but his father was </div>
<div id="tq_166" class="t s1_166">absolutely against it, so much against it that if he became a sannyasin, his father </div>
<div id="tr_166" class="t s1_166">would disown him. Now they are some of the richest people of the country. He </div>
<div id="ts_166" class="t s1_166">has not the guts to say to the father, "It is perfectly okay, you can disown me," </div>
<div id="tt_166" class="t s1_166">but he has a sympathetic heart -- and he was the only man who raised his hands. </div>
<div id="tu_166" class="t s1_166">Now to talk to such people becomes impossible, unless you completely forget </div>
<div id="tv_166" class="t s1_166">them, and whether they exist or not. And that's what I had to do. I did not look at </div>
<div id="tw_166" class="t s1_166">them at all, I just looked at my people and talked to my people. And I made a </div>
<div id="tx_166" class="t s1_166">condition to them that they could not distort any statement; they had to publish </div>
<div id="ty_166" class="t s1_166">my whole statement as I have given it. But they don't even have the guts to </div>
<div id="tz_166" class="t s1_166">publish their own questions and my answers, because my answers expose the </div>
<div id="t10_166" class="t s1_166">dirty politics and the dirty journalism that follows politics. </div>
<div id="t11_166" class="t s1_166">Bodhidharma speaks as if he's speaking to himself. Then he can open his heart </div>
<div id="t12_166" class="t s1_166">totally, without any limitation. He is absolutely unconcerned about who is going </div>
<div id="t13_166" class="t s1_166">to listen to him, who is going to read him. Perhaps this is the reason why he </div>
<div id="t14_166" class="t s1_166">reaches tremendously deep insights into human nature. You will see statements </div>
<div id="t15_166" class="t s1_166">that have never been made before, but Bodhidharma has made them so clearly </div>
<div id="t16_166" class="t s1_166">that they cannot be refuted either. </div>
