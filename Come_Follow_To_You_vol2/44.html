<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">They laughed. They said, "The old man has gone out of his mind. Why send five </div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">when one is needed?" But the old man was insistent, so five started on the </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">journey. </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">The next morning when they were passing a village, a messenger came running </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">to them from the chief of the village. "Our priest has died and we need a priest. </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">The salary is good." The village looked rich, prosperous, so one of the five said, "I </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">would like to stay because that, too, is Buddha's work. Why go to the valley? </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">There, too, I am going to do the same work. You four will be enough -- only one </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">is needed -- so I will stay here." One dropped. </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">The next day they were passing by the outskirts of a town. The king of the town </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">passed by them on his horse. He looked at them. One young monk was very </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">beautiful and healthy and radiant. The king said, "Wait. I am looking for a young </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">man because my daughter is ready to be married. I have been watching and </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">looking, but you seem to be exactly right. Are you ready? I have only one </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">daughter. My whole kingdom will be yours." </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">Of course, the young man said to his friends: "Goodbye!" He left; the second </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">disappeared. </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">Now the other three became aware that the old man was not mad. The way was </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">really long and distractions a thousand and one! </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">Now the three decided, "But we will not do such a thing" </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">-- although deep down </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">they were feeling jealous that one man had become a king and another had </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">become a great priest. And who knows about what is going to happen in that </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">valley? </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">The third night they lost the way. From far away on a hilltop only one lamp was </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">seen, only one house. Somehow they reached there. There was only one young </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">woman there and she said, "It is good that you have come. You are a godsend </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">because my mother and my father were to come back this evening and they have </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">not come back. I was very afraid to be alone in this house so far away from the </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">town. It is good that you are here. You are a godsend, you are sent by Buddha </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">himself. Please stay with me and don't leave me until my parents come." </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">The next morning they had to leave. But one of them -- who, deep down, had </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">fallen in love with the woman -- said, "I cannot go until her parents are back. </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">That would not be compassion." Compassion was not the thing, PASSION was </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">the thing! But when there is passion, people talk about compassion. </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">The other two said, "This is not good. We have to reach and you are dropping </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">out. And we had decided that now we would not do that." </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">The man said, "I have been taught my whole life to be compassionate. The </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">woman is alone, the parents have not returned. To leave won't be good, it won't </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">be virtuous. Buddha will never forgive me. You can go" -- in fact, he wanted </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">them to go -- "but I will stay here." The third dropped. </div>
<div id="t16_44" class="t s1_44">In a village the next morning they were surrounded by a crowd, because the </div>
<div id="t17_44" class="t s1_44">village was atheistic; they didn't believe in Buddha. The two were challenged: </div>
