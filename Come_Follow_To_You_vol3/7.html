<div id="t1_7" class="t s1_7">A PROPHET IS NOT WITHOUT HONOUR, SAVE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, </div>
<div id="t2_7" class="t s1_7">AND IN HIS OWN HOUSE. I would like to add one thing more: "And in his </div>
<div id="t3_7" class="t s1_7">own time." </div>
<div id="t4_7" class="t s1_7">You worship Buddha now, very easily. No problem arises because there is a </div>
<div id="t5_7" class="t s1_7">distance of twenty-five centuries. You worship Mahavir. All over the world </div>
<div id="t6_7" class="t s1_7">millions go on praying to Jesus. These same people crucified him. They are the </div>
<div id="t7_7" class="t s1_7">same people who were offended in him, who denied him. What has happened? -</div>
<div id="t8_7" class="t s1_7">- a distance of two thousand years. Now, your ego doesn't feel offended, you </div>
<div id="t9_7" class="t s1_7">don't have any competition with him; maybe he was really a son of God. But he </div>
<div id="ta_7" class="t s1_7">offended his own contemporaries. He was talking one day in a village and </div>
<div id="tb_7" class="t s1_7">somebody asked "Do you believe in Abraham, the founder of Judaism?" Jesus </div>
<div id="tc_7" class="t s1_7">said something which has been offending Jews since then. Jesus said, "Abraham? </div>
<div id="td_7" class="t s1_7">Before Abraham was, I am." Let me repeat it in another way: if Christians come </div>
<div id="te_7" class="t s1_7">to me and ask, "Do you believe in Jesus?" and I tell them, "Before Jesus was, I </div>
<div id="tf_7" class="t s1_7">am," they will be offended. They will never be able to forgive me. </div>
<div id="tg_7" class="t s1_7">This man Jesus is claiming that he is someone who was, even before Abraham. </div>
<div id="th_7" class="t s1_7">They had known that he was born in their village, they knew his birth date, they </div>
<div id="ti_7" class="t s1_7">knew his father and his mother and his sisters and his brothers. They were still </div>
<div id="tj_7" class="t s1_7">working in their workshop and this man said, "I am, before Abraham was." This </div>
<div id="tk_7" class="t s1_7">was going too far -- "No, he cannot be forgiven for it." But what he was saying </div>
<div id="tl_7" class="t s1_7">was the truth, because Jesus is a quality, which has nothing to do with any </div>
<div id="tm_7" class="t s1_7">person. It is a quality like love. If you say, "Before Abraham was, love is," nobody </div>
<div id="tn_7" class="t s1_7">will be offended because love is not a person. You don't take it as a person, you </div>
<div id="to_7" class="t s1_7">take it as a quality. Jesus is a quality of tremendous love. Jesus is a quality of </div>
<div id="tp_7" class="t s1_7">tremendous perception, vision, of tremendous realisation. Jesus is a quality -- but </div>
<div id="tq_7" class="t s1_7">to see that quality you will have to drop your egos. Only then can you see, </div>
<div id="tr_7" class="t s1_7">otherwise your egos will be heavy on your eyes and it will be almost impossible </div>
<div id="ts_7" class="t s1_7">to see. </div>
<div id="tt_7" class="t s1_7">Just a few days ago, I was reading G. K. Chesterton's life. He lived his whole life </div>
<div id="tu_7" class="t s1_7">in London. One day he was preparing for a journey, a long journey, and </div>
<div id="tv_7" class="t s1_7">everything was packed, everything was ready. A friend asked, "Where are you </div>
<div id="tw_7" class="t s1_7">going?" Chesterton said, "I am going to London." The friend said, "Your wit, your </div>
<div id="tx_7" class="t s1_7">remark escapes me. What do you mean? We ARE in London, so where are you </div>
<div id="ty_7" class="t s1_7">going?" Chesterton said, "I am going to London via Paris, via Bombay, via Tokyo, </div>
<div id="tz_7" class="t s1_7">via New York, because I have lived in London so long that my eyes have become </div>
<div id="t10_7" class="t s1_7">clouded and I cannot see where London is, what London is." </div>
<div id="t11_7" class="t s1_7">When Jesus is standing just in front of you, you cannot see him. You will have to </div>
<div id="t12_7" class="t s1_7">go via -- via the Vatican, via Rome, via popes and preachers and churches. Only </div>
<div id="t13_7" class="t s1_7">then may you be able to see who Jesus is. When Jesus confronts you, he offends. </div>
<div id="t14_7" class="t s1_7">His very being, his height, his depth, become offensive. You feel that you have </div>
<div id="t15_7" class="t s1_7">failed. You feel that you have not lived. You feel that you have not loved. You </div>
<div id="t16_7" class="t s1_7">will become an enemy. With Jesus these are the two possibilities: either you </div>
<div id="t17_7" class="t s1_7">follow him or you become the enemy. You cannot remain neutral, you cannot </div>
