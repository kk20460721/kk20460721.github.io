<div id="ti_260" class="t s1_260">great army and he was a great king. Buddha could not accept such nonsense, </div>
<div id="tj_260" class="t s1_260">such a corrupted man, as a reincarnation of God. </div>
<div id="tk_260" class="t s1_260">Buddha was very straightforward. He said, "All the statues, all the temples, all </div>

<div id="tz_260" class="t s1_260">He did not say it because in China the Buddhists were trying to make as many </div>

<div id="t14_260" class="t s1_260">would go against the very Buddhists who have been working to convert the </div>

<div id="t17_260" class="t s1_260">gave donations to the monasteries. </div>
