<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">two ways to do it: the Master touches your head and he pulls up your energy -- it </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">is a little difficult. When he touches your feet then he forces it up, which is easier. </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">Jesus had been touching their heads all the years that they had been with him. </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">Now he touched their feet. From another side, he wanted to give them a push </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">before he left. He wanted to let them become aware of their own energy before </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">he left, because he would be gone and they would be left in darkness; their own </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">flame was not lit. He tried to force the energy up from below, and asked,'Know </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">ye what I have done to you?' but they knew not. They simply thought. A few </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">who had a certain love for him must have felt awkward, and in that </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">awkwardness they missed the opportunity. Someone who was just indifferent, </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">who neither loved nor hated, would have watched the whole thing like a </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">bystander, a spectator, not involved in it. One who did not love him, but hated </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">him -- Judas -- must have felt very good that now the right thing was being done. </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">Judas was the only educated, sophisticated disciple of Jesus, and he betrayed. It </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">is a symbolic thing that intellect was the renegade; intellect was going to betray. </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">He was the intellect of that group of disciples. He was the most scholarly, </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">sophisticated, educated, the most articulate in logic, in thinking. But when you </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">become too clever, your very cleverness becomes like a smokescreen. One great </div>

<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">This is that which can be said, that which can be understood. Only Jesus is not </div>
