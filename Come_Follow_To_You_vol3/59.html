<div id="t1_59" class="t s1_59">not aware what was going to happen. I tell you, even Jesus was not aware what </div>
<div id="t2_59" class="t s1_59">was going to happen. A man like Jesus lives from moment to moment. He's </div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s1_59">available. Whatsoever happens, he will respond to it. </div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">It happened suddenly. He entered the temple and saw that the temple had been </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">destroyed; that no more was it a house of prayer, that people were not praying, </div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s1_59">that people were not meditating, that people had completely forgotten the </div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s1_59">purpose of the temple, for what it existed, and that this temple was no more the </div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s1_59">abode of God. Now it had been captured by the priests. </div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s1_59">And priests have always been against God. They live in the name of God, but </div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s1_59">they have always been against God. They teach prayer, but whatsoever they </div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s1_59">teach is false. They teach doctrines; they don't teach the truth, because you can </div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s1_59">teach the truth only if you live it. There is no other teaching about it. </div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">I have heard a beautiful story about St. Francis, another Jesus. One day he said to </div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s1_59">his disciple, Leo, "Brother Leo, let us go to the town, and teach and preach to </div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s1_59">people." </div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s1_59">They went into the town. They went up and down the streets meeting people, </div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s1_59">smiling, talking to people -- sometimes patting a boy, sometimes smiling at a </div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s1_59">woman, and sometimes saying a cheery word to a tired traveller. And it went on </div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s1_59">and on. But now it was almost getting dark and the sun was setting. Leo asked, </div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s1_59">"Master, when are we going to preach?" </div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s1_59">And Francis said, "And what have we been doing? We have been preaching; we </div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s1_59">have been talking to people. They have observed us; they have listened to us. A </div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s1_59">few of them even looked into our eyes; a few of them have become aware what </div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s1_59">treasures we are carrying within our hearts. And there is no other teaching; there </div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s1_59">is no other preaching." Said St. Francis, "There is no use walking anywhere to </div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s1_59">preach, unless we preach as we walk." </div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s1_59">A priest is not living what he is speaking. A priest goes on talking about and </div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s1_59">about and about. And whenever a temple is possessed by a priest it is destroyed. </div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s1_59">The great temple of God in Jerusalem was not destroyed by the enemies; it was </div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s1_59">destroyed by the priests. But it has always been so -- the friends are the real </div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s1_59">enemies. Those who pretend they are the protectors, they are the ones who are </div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s1_59">destroying. And it has always been so, because rebellion has always been </div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s1_59">misunderstood as revolution. </div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s1_59">Once Jesus is gone, his disciples start organizing -- the doctrine, the dogma. Then </div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s1_59">the doctrine and the dogma become more important; then the future becomes </div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s1_59">more important. Then they become missionaries; not people who live in the here </div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s1_59">and now, not people who are spontaneous, not people who love, but people who </div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s1_59">talk about love. And if you argue against them, they are ready to fight. They are </div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s1_59">even ready to go to wars to defend the doctrine of love. </div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s1_59">It happened that an authentic enquirer, a seeker, went to a rabbi, to a priest -- the </div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s1_59">most famous of course of those days, and he said, "Please tell me the whole </div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s1_59">Torah, but in short. I will be standing on one leg, and you have to finish the </div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s1_59">whole Torah while I am standing on one leg." </div>
