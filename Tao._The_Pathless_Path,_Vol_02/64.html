<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">CHAPTER 4. TAO TANTRA</div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s2_64">In fact, you have always been saved. You were carrying an unnecessary load and because of that</div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s2_64">load you could not ﬂy into the sky. Now you can ﬂy. The Master is just an excuse. Without a Master</div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s2_64">it is difﬁcult for you to drop your ego because you need some excuse. Otherwise how to drop it?</div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s2_64">Where to drop it? At whose feet to drop it? The Master is just an excuse.</div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s2_64">You fall in love with a man – a man like Jesus, a man like Buddha, naturally attracts thousands of</div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s2_64">people, seekers. who fall in love – and the man is so tremendously beautiful that you would like to</div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s2_64">surrender all. That is just an excuse. Once you have surrendered you will know that you are not</div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s2_64">saved by anybody else, you are saved by your surrender. But it will be known only when you have</div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s2_64">surrendered, not before it. To become a disciple is to be saved.</div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s2_64">You ask: CAN THE MASTER REALLY SAVE THE DISCIPLE? It is very simple. It is nothing much</div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s2_64">to fuss about. Sometimes it has even happened that a disciple has saved a Master – because, in</div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s2_64">fact, it is love that saves. Sometimes it has happened that the Master was not really a Master, was</div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s2_64">not himself enlightened, but was a charismatic man, a man of great magnetism. And somebody</div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s2_64">surrendered to him and through surrender became enlightened. Many times it has happened that</div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s2_64">the disciple has become enlightened before the Master – you will be surprised because you think</div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s2_64">that you can only become enlightened through an enlightened Master. All rubbish! You become</div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s2_64">enlightened through surrender. Even if you have surrendered to somebody who is just a pseudo-</div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s2_64">Master, who simply pretends that he is a Master, if your surrender is total you are saved.</div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s2_64">And</div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s2_64">it has happened sometimes that the Master was saved by the disciple when the disciple became</div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s2_64">enlightened.</div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s2_64">Let me tell you one beautiful Hasidic parable.</div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s2_64">ELISHA BEN ABUYA WAS A GREAT RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR. But he was just a scholar.</div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s2_64">He</div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s2_64">attracted many people, many talented people. His name was known all over Israel. Many people</div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s2_64">came and surrendered to him. But he was just a scholar, a pundit, he was not a real Master. He</div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s2_64">knew about God but he had never encountered God. AND IT HAPPENED THAT LATE IN HIS LIFE</div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s2_64">HE TURNED A SCEPTIC AND BECAME REBELLIOUS – became irreligious, turned against God.</div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s2_64">And he was a great logician and well versed in scriptures, so it was very difﬁcult to defeat him. When</div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s2_64">he started talking against God he was as impressive as when he was talking for God. He was a real</div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s2_64">intellectual.</div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s2_64">HIS CHIEF DISCIPLE RABBI MEIR TRIED MANY TIMES TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE FOLD.</div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s2_64">The disciple tried to bring him back to the fold. Rabbi Meir, who was Elisha Ben Abuya’s disciple,</div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s2_64">had become enlightened.</div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s2_64">And the disciple TRIED MANY TIMES TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE FOLD BUT THE OLD</div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s2_64">MAN WAS REALLY A LOGICIAN AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ARGUE WITH HIM. The disciple</div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s2_64">suffered very much because he loved the man. He knew that he was not enlightened and he knew</div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s2_64">that he was not a real man of knowing but he loved the man and he felt grateful because he had</div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s2_64">become enlightened through him. Whosoever he was, whatsoever he was, through surrendering</div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s2_64">into his feet Rabbi Meir had become enlightened. How could he be ungrateful? He persisted.</div>
<div id="t16_64" class="t s2_64">RABBI MEIR, HOWEVER, PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT. WHEN HE HEARD THAT ELISHA WAS</div>
<div id="t17_64" class="t s2_64">DANGEROUSLY ILL HE WENT TO VISIT HIM. HE AGAIN ASKED HIM TO REPENT. AND ELISHA</div>
