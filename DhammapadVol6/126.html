<div id="t3_126" class="t s1_126">charges for... what is going on, but she has heard. She is simply repeating. </div>
<div id="t4_126" class="t s1_126">And this is how your knowledgeable people are. They have heard about God, they have </div>
<div id="t5_126" class="t s1_126">not seen. They have heard about truth, they have not experienced. They have heard </div>
<div id="t6_126" class="t s1_126">about love, they have not lived. They can talk and they can argue and they can prove </div>
<div id="t7_126" class="t s1_126">themselves great scholars -- but they are stupid people. Beware of them -- they are not </div>
<div id="t8_126" class="t s1_126">pure. They can even impose a certain discipline upon themselves out of this borrowed </div>
<div id="t9_126" class="t s1_126">knowledge, but their idea of purity will also be something foolish. </div>
<div id="ta_126" class="t s1_126">Somebody will eat only vegetarian food; that will be his idea of purity. Somebody will </div>

<div id="tf_126" class="t s1_126">In India milk is thought to be the purest food, SATTVIC, the most pure. Now that is </div>
<div id="tg_126" class="t s1_126">strange, because milk is animal food. It is like eggs, it comes out of the animal's body. </div>
<div id="th_126" class="t s1_126">And certainly it is not for you -- it is for the kids of the animal. And it is dangerous too, </div>
<div id="ti_126" class="t s1_126">because the cow gives milk for HER kid, and her kid is going to become a bull! Now in </div>

<div id="tr_126" class="t s1_126">fact to live just on water is to eat your own meat, because every day one pound of your </div>
<div id="ts_126" class="t s1_126">weight will disappear. "Where has it gone?" I asked the man. "Who has eaten it?" </div>

<div id="tu_126" class="t s1_126">because everybody says that this is the best, the most sattvic, the most pure food -- </div>
<div id="tv_126" class="t s1_126">water, and Ganges water, not ordinary water." </div>
<div id="tw_126" class="t s1_126">Now, the water of the Ganges is the most impure in India, because people throw dead </div>
