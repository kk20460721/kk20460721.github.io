<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">there is only love. When Jesus touched the feet of his disciples, love touched their </div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s1_40">feet. Not Jesus, remember, but love touched their feet. Ramakrishna went to seek </div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s1_40">and search where Vivekananda was, but Ramakrishna didn't go anywhere. He </div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s1_40">was no more -- where could he go? how could he go? who would go? -- love </div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s1_40">went in search. When Ramakrishna cried and tears fell down, it was love crying. </div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s1_40">Even Vivekananda felt embarrassed when Ramakrishna would stand and start </div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s1_40">dancing when he came, or he would hug him. Even he used to feel embarrassed. </div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s1_40">Somehow it looked a little outlandish, eccentric. And this old man seemed to be </div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s1_40">crazy. If psychoanalysts had been present there, they may have suspected </div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s1_40">homosexuality, because psychoanalysis tries to explain the flower through the </div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s1_40">fertilizer. Then, even the flower starts stinking; it smells of the fertilizer. But if </div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s1_40">you ask me such questions, I explain the fertilizer through the flower. Then, even </div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s1_40">the fertilizer has a fragrance in it. Jesus touched the feet, not of the fertilizer but </div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s1_40">of the flower, of the possibility. </div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s1_40">Ramakrishna went in search. To ordinary people Vivekananda was just ordinary, </div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s1_40">but not for Ramakrishna. Something extraordinary was waiting there: it needed </div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s1_40">help, care; it needed attention, it needed love to explode into being. </div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s1_40">Jesus touched those disciples' feet in deep reverence, in great hope. He touched </div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s1_40">their feet to show them,'You are not that which you think you are. You are that </div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s1_40">which you are seeking; you are my God.' Those were only seeds, but Jesus could </div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s1_40">see the flowering. He touched their feet because of the possibility of the </div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s1_40">flowering -- someday or other they would explode into beautiful flowers, they </div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s1_40">would blossom. He loved them, respected them for that. For him it was already a </div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s1_40">present phenomenon. They didn't know, they were unaware, they were fast </div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s1_40">asleep. The seed is nothing but a flower, fast asleep and snoring. And what is a </div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s1_40">flower? -- a seed that has discovered itself, a seed that has come to know itself, a </div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s1_40">seed that has become itself -- that's what a flower is. Even a weed is not a weed; a </div>
<div id="ts_40" class="t s1_40">weed is one who is on the path to discover itself. Even a weed has tremendous </div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s1_40">possibilities. You may not know that even wheat was once thought to be a weed; </div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s1_40">even wheat! Humanity discovered, by and by, that it was nourishment. Now you </div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s1_40">cannot think of wheat as a weed. And if you find some weeds in the garden, </div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s1_40">always be respectful -- who knows? They are on the way; some day their </div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s1_40">capacities and possibilities will be discovered. </div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s1_40">They were ordinary weeds, those disciples, very ordinary human beings, but not </div>
<div id="tz_40" class="t s1_40">to Jesus. Jesus could look into their future. Their future was present to Jesus, and </div>
<div id="t10_40" class="t s1_40">he touched the feet of that future. Even a man like Peter could not believe, could </div>
<div id="t11_40" class="t s1_40">not see the appropriateness of it. But in love, there is nothing appropriate and not </div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s1_40">appropriate. In love, everything takes a totally different flavour. Then, </div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s1_40">everything is holy. </div>
