<div id="t2_89" class="t s1_89">SOMETHING ELSE? PLEASE HELP ME LET GO OF THIS GARBAGE. </div>
<div id="t3_89" class="t s1_89">Dhyana Yogi, if it is garbage, if you really understand that it is garbage, then there is no </div>
<div id="t4_89" class="t s1_89">question of helping you drop it. Knowing it as garbage is dropping it! </div>
<div id="t5_89" class="t s1_89">But is seems that you have heard me say that it is garbage. It has become a belief in you; </div>
<div id="t6_89" class="t s1_89">it is not your own knowing, it is not your own experience. You are still clinging to it. </div>
<div id="t7_89" class="t s1_89">Deep down you still think it is precious, it is not garbage. Deep down you still think </div>
<div id="t8_89" class="t s1_89">these are diamonds not pebbles. Deep down somewhere you still believe it is a treasure </div>
<div id="t9_89" class="t s1_89">to be protected and guarded. </div>
<div id="ta_89" class="t s1_89">Don't start believing me, because that will make no difference. You were believing in </div>
<div id="tb_89" class="t s1_89">Mohammed, or you were believing in Christ, or in Buddha, and then you come and you </div>
<div id="tc_89" class="t s1_89">start believing in me. That is not a revolution, that is not conversion. You simply change </div>
<div id="td_89" class="t s1_89">the object of your belief, but the belief remains -- the same believing mind. You believe </div>
<div id="te_89" class="t s1_89">in Jesus, but Jesus speaks the language which is now two thousand years old. You </div>
<div id="tf_89" class="t s1_89">cannot make much sense out of it; the context is lost in which it was relevant. I speak </div>
<div id="tg_89" class="t s1_89">the language of the twentieth century. You can make sense out of it, so you withdraw </div>
<div id="th_89" class="t s1_89">your belief from Jesus and you start believing in me. This is very simple and cheap. </div>
<div id="ti_89" class="t s1_89">I am not saying believe in me. I am saying drop all believing and start seeing, because </div>
<div id="tj_89" class="t s1_89">belief will remain a blindness -- start seeing! Is it really garbage that you are carrying? Is </div>
<div id="tk_89" class="t s1_89">it your understanding that it is garbage? Then you will not ask how to drop it. Nobody </div>
<div id="tl_89" class="t s1_89">asks how to drop garbage. The problem arises only because deep down you know </div>
<div id="tm_89" class="t s1_89">yourself that it is gold. And somebody says that it is garbage and says it very </div>
<div id="tn_89" class="t s1_89">convincingly, and you cannot argue, and he silences you. And the man has such </div>
<div id="to_89" class="t s1_89">authenticity, such integrity, that in his presence you simply become overflooded with </div>
<div id="tp_89" class="t s1_89">his being. You simply start saying, "Yes, it is garbage." But deep down you still know it </div>
<div id="tq_89" class="t s1_89">is not garbage, it is gold! Hence the problem arises: how to drop it? </div>
<div id="tr_89" class="t s1_89">If you understand on your own that it is garbage, you will never ask how to drop it. </div>

<div id="t11_89" class="t s1_89">Dhyana Yogi, you say, "Why am I feeling I am missing something?" </div>
<div id="t12_89" class="t s1_89">Because from your very childhood you have been told that in yourself, intrinsically, you </div>
<div id="t13_89" class="t s1_89">are worthless. As you are you have no value. The value has to be attained, the worth </div>
<div id="t14_89" class="t s1_89">has to be proved. From your very childhood you have been taught this millions of </div>
