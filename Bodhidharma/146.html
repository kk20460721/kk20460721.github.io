<div id="t1_146" class="t s1_146">his greatest attachment was being destroyed before his eyes and nothing could </div>
<div id="t2_146" class="t s1_146">be done. The fire had gone too far. </div>
<div id="t3_146" class="t s1_146">Just then, his youngest son came running to him, telling him, "Father, don't be </div>
<div id="t4_146" class="t s1_146">worried. Yesterday I sold the house. The king was continually saying that it was </div>
<div id="t5_146" class="t s1_146">embarrassing to him that you have a better palace. Finally I decided to sell it -- </div>
<div id="t6_146" class="t s1_146">and he was ready to give any price." </div>
<div id="t7_146" class="t s1_146">Suddenly the tears dried and the man started smiling. Nothing had changed. The </div>

<div id="t9_146" class="t s1_146">house that was hurting him, it was the ego, HIS house. And then his younger son </div>
<div id="ta_146" class="t s1_146">came and said, "Father, what are you doing here? Although we had agreed to sell </div>
<div id="tb_146" class="t s1_146">the palace, no sale deed has been written yet. And of course the king is not going </div>
<div id="tc_146" class="t s1_146">to pay the money. I have every suspicion that he is behind the fire." </div>
<div id="td_146" class="t s1_146">And again the tears started coming. And the situation was the same; nothing had </div>
<div id="te_146" class="t s1_146">changed. Only the idea had changed; the house became his, then there was great </div>
<div id="tf_146" class="t s1_146">misery. The house was no longer his, all misery disappeared. </div>
<div id="tg_146" class="t s1_146">And then the king himself came in his chariot and he said, "You need not be </div>
<div id="th_146" class="t s1_146">worried. I am a man of my word. If I have purchased it, I have purchased it. No </div>
<div id="ti_146" class="t s1_146">sale deed has been written, no money has been advanced, but because yesterday </div>
<div id="tj_146" class="t s1_146">we agreed verbally, that is enough. It is MY house that is burning. You need not </div>
<div id="tk_146" class="t s1_146">be worried." </div>
<div id="tl_146" class="t s1_146">And suddenly, instead of tears, the man was smiling. </div>

<div id="tp_146" class="t s1_146">OR REALITY TO LOOK FOR REALITY. </div>
<div id="tq_146" class="t s1_146">It is a vicious circle: mind and reality, mind and the world. Mind creates a certain </div>
<div id="tr_146" class="t s1_146">world which is nothing but your projection. And then, that certain projection </div>
<div id="ts_146" class="t s1_146">creates your mind. And this way, this vicious circle goes on supporting the other; </div>
<div id="tt_146" class="t s1_146">your mind supports your projections, your projections support your mind. And </div>

<div id="t10_146" class="t s1_146">This is a beautiful definition of samadhi. When the mind is still and the reality is </div>
<div id="t11_146" class="t s1_146">still -- when you are out of the vicious circle -- all is silence, profound silence. </div>
<div id="t12_146" class="t s1_146">The word, SAMADHI has to be understood. It means coming to a state of </div>
<div id="t13_146" class="t s1_146">absolute equilibrium, coming to a state of absolute balance. The word comes </div>
<div id="t14_146" class="t s1_146">from Sanskrit. And Sanskrit is one of the languages in the world which has </div>
<div id="t15_146" class="t s1_146">words with profound meaning. Not just dictionary meaning, but with existential </div>
<div id="t16_146" class="t s1_146">meaning. Other languages have only dictionary meanings. </div>
