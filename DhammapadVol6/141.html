<div id="t1_141" class="t s1_141">ages again and again. The Christian can't believe that Buddha is a christ, because he </div>
<div id="t2_141" class="t s1_141">does not serve the poor, he does not heal the wounded, he does not make the blind see, </div>
<div id="t3_141" class="t s1_141">he does not do miracles like Jesus did. Lazarus died and Jesus came, and after four days </div>
<div id="t4_141" class="t s1_141">he revived Lazarus. Buddha does nothing like that; on the contrary, he does something </div>
<div id="t5_141" class="t s1_141">absolutely different. </div>
<div id="t6_141" class="t s1_141">There is a beautiful story: </div>
<div id="t7_141" class="t s1_141">A woman lost her young son; just a few days before her husband had died. Kissa </div>
<div id="t8_141" class="t s1_141">Gautami was her name, and now her only son had died. She was in great despair, </div>
<div id="t9_141" class="t s1_141">naturally; the child was her only hope. Buddha was staying in the town; people said, </div>
<div id="ta_141" class="t s1_141">"Don't cry and don't weep. Why don't you take the child to the Buddha? He is so </div>
<div id="tb_141" class="t s1_141">compassionate, he may revive him back to life." </div>
<div id="tc_141" class="t s1_141">The woman rushed with the dead body of the child. Buddha looked at the woman, told </div>
<div id="td_141" class="t s1_141">the woman to put the child in front of him and said to her, "Yes, I will revive him, but </div>
<div id="te_141" class="t s1_141">you will have to fulfill one condition." </div>
<div id="tf_141" class="t s1_141">The woman said, "I am ready to give even my life. Say any condition and I will fulfill </div>
<div id="tg_141" class="t s1_141">it." </div>
<div id="th_141" class="t s1_141">Buddha said, "It is a simple condition, I never make big requirements of people, only </div>
<div id="ti_141" class="t s1_141">small requirements; this is a very simple thing. You just go into the town and bring a </div>
<div id="tj_141" class="t s1_141">few mustard seeds. Just remember one thing: the mustard seeds should come from a </div>
<div id="tk_141" class="t s1_141">house where nobody has ever died." </div>
<div id="tl_141" class="t s1_141">The woman was in an insane state, she could not see the point. How can you find a </div>
<div id="tm_141" class="t s1_141">house where nobody has ever died? She rushed with great hope and she knew that </div>
<div id="tn_141" class="t s1_141">every house has mustard seeds because that was the only crop the people were </div>
<div id="to_141" class="t s1_141">growing. The whole village was doing the same work, growing mustard seeds -- so </div>
<div id="tp_141" class="t s1_141">there was no problem. </div>
<div id="tq_141" class="t s1_141">She knocked on many doors, the people said, "A few mustard seeds? We can bring </div>
<div id="tr_141" class="t s1_141">cartloads of mustard seeds, but we cannot fulfill the condition; many people have died </div>
<div id="ts_141" class="t s1_141">in our house. So our mustard seeds won't do." </div>
<div id="tt_141" class="t s1_141">By the evening the woman came to her senses. She had knocked on many doors; slowly </div>
<div id="tu_141" class="t s1_141">slowly, she saw the point that death is inevitable -- it happens to everybody, that </div>
<div id="tv_141" class="t s1_141">nobody can escape from it. She came back, she was a totally different woman when she </div>
<div id="tw_141" class="t s1_141">came back in the evening. The child was there, Buddha was waiting. He said, "Where </div>
<div id="tx_141" class="t s1_141">are the mustard seeds?" </div>
<div id="ty_141" class="t s1_141">The woman laughed, fell down at his feet and said, "Initiate me into your path, because </div>
<div id="tz_141" class="t s1_141">I have understood your message, that everybody has to die. Today my son has died, a </div>
<div id="t10_141" class="t s1_141">few days before my husband died, a few days afterwards I am going to die. Before I die </div>
<div id="t11_141" class="t s1_141">I want to see the deathless. Now I am not interested in my child being raised from the </div>
<div id="t12_141" class="t s1_141">dead. Now I am interested myself in seeing the eternal life." </div>
<div id="t13_141" class="t s1_141">Buddha initiated Kissa Gautami. </div>
<div id="t14_141" class="t s1_141">Now, these stories are the same, almost the same. Lazarus' sisters or Jesus' disciples, </div>
<div id="t15_141" class="t s1_141">they sent for him. He was away. He came -- it took four days for him to reach there -- </div>
