<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">CHAPTER 7. ON THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE</div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s2_91">alone; to listen to the inner master and to forget about outer masters. He came across a beautiful</div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s2_91">oak grove. Many oak trees, old, ancient, had made a grove – their branches were entangled with</div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s2_91">each other in such a way that there was a natural protection from the rain, from the sun and from</div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s2_91">the elements of nature. And nearby was a lake. The grove was very silent and it was so deep in the</div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s2_91">forest that nobody ever passed by it.</div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s2_91">The Suﬁ went into it, he loved it, the place had a charm of its own. He started meditating there.</div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s2_91">Once a week for a few hours he would move out and go to the nearest village to procure some food,</div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s2_91">and then for seven days he would be lost in his meditation.</div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s2_91">Suﬁs continuously repeat the name of God, ’Allah’.</div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s2_91">The mantra of the Mohammedans means:</div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s2_91">’There is no God but God’, but Suﬁs have cut it down to a single word, ’Allah’ or ’God’, because they</div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s2_91">say it is possible that some day you may die when you are just in the middle of repeating the mantra.</div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s2_91">If you are repeating the mantra and you die just in the middle of it, you would have said: ’There is no</div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s2_91">God’, so you die an atheist. At the last moment you don’t bear witness to the Divine; on the contrary,</div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s2_91">you die in a negativity. So they say that it is dangerous, and they don’t repeat the Mohammedan</div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s2_91">mantra in its complete form, they simply repeat ’Allah, Allah, Allah’ so that at the last moment their</div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s2_91">heart is ﬁlled, their breath is ﬁlled with the name of Allah, with the remembrance of him. That’s what</div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s2_91">they call ziqra.</div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s2_91">The Suﬁ chanted his mantra – ’Allah, Allah, Allah’ – for months. He started feeling very calm and</div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s2_91">quiet and cool and collected. It was so silent around the grove, so peaceful, and the same peace</div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s2_91">started ﬁlling him inside, in the interior-most parts of his being: But he was not happy. It was not</div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s2_91">enough. Enlightenment, nirvana, was yet far away.</div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s2_91">Years passed and the grove became almost a sacred spot. Luxuriant growth happened to the oak</div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s2_91">trees, suddenly they became as if young again, with new foliage, and the whole grove was ﬁlled with</div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s2_91">beauty – but there was sadness in the heart of the Suﬁ. But he waited, and he did whatsoever could</div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s2_91">be done: he was continuously ﬁlled with prayer, meditation. Eighteen years passed, but he was as</div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s2_91">far from nirvana as ever. Of course he was now peaceful and silent – but yet not blissful. Something</div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s2_91">had dissolved but nothing had descended; something had left, he was empty, and emptiness of</div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s2_91">course is silent – but he was not ﬁlled. The emptiness had remained emptiness and now there was</div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s2_91">nothing more to do.</div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s2_91">One dark night, in the middle of the night, suddenly a suspicion arose in his mind, a doubt came –</div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s2_91">because eighteen years is a very long time and he had put all his effort, all his being into it, he had</div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s2_91">not held anything back, so if it had not happened now then it seemed it would never ever happen. A</div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s2_91">doubt arose. He started thinking: Is it possible that this oak grove is not allowing my prayers to go</div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s2_91">out as it is not allowing rains and sun to come in? The foliage is so thick, maybe my prayers reach</div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s2_91">only to the underside of the leaves and they don’t go beyond, so God has not heard me. As the</div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s2_91">sun can never penetrate this grove, maybe my prayers have not penetrated the outer cosmos. This</div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s2_91">grove has been an exploiter, a bloodsucker.</div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s2_91">He became so afraid of the grove that he simply escaped from it in the middle of the dark night.</div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s2_91">But at that very moment, miles away from the grove, on the road a beggar was passing, going from</div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s2_91">one town to another. Suddenly, from out of the blue, a deep urge came into him to go into the forest.</div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s2_91">Tao: The Three Treasures, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t18_91" class="t s2_91">91</div>
<div id="t19_91" class="t s3_91">Osho</div>
