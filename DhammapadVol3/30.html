<div id="t1_30" class="t s1_30">poets had been working for months to get their verses ready, and this was the day of </div>
<div id="t2_30" class="t s1_30">the great gathering of honor. </div>
<div id="t3_30" class="t s1_30">The royal guards separated the guests from the onlookers but the Sufi began to say, "I </div>
<div id="t4_30" class="t s1_30">don't want to be praised, I don't want to be honored, I don't want an ode in homage to </div>
<div id="t5_30" class="t s1_30">me to be recited</div>
<div id="t6_30" class="t s1_30">....</div>
<div id="t7_30" class="t s1_30">" </div>
<div id="t8_30" class="t s1_30">This, however, was to no avail, for the guards hustled him into the audience-chamber. </div>
<div id="t9_30" class="t s1_30">He was struggling so hard -- others only resisted from locally conventional modesty -- </div>
<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">that the king ordered him to be seated next to the throne. Then the king ordered the </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">king of poets to recite the ode in honor of this most modest man. The poem was </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">nowhere to be found. They asked the sage his name, but nobody could remember who </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">he was, if anyone. Finally the king asked him to say something. He said, "I do not want </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">to be praised!" </div>
<div id="tf_30" class="t s1_30">"Why not?" demanded the king. "If you don't want to be praised you should not have </div>
<div id="tg_30" class="t s1_30">come to the reception!" </div>
<div id="th_30" class="t s1_30">"But I did not come -- your guards picked me up in the street. I was not invited even. </div>
<div id="ti_30" class="t s1_30">All I was doing was saying that I did not want to be praised!" </div>
<div id="tj_30" class="t s1_30">But why should you say that? He was shouting outside the palace, "I do not want to be </div>
<div id="tk_30" class="t s1_30">praised! I do not want to be praised!" And he was making such a nuisance. Why? The </div>
<div id="tl_30" class="t s1_30">ways of the ego are very cunning. It can play the role of being humble. It can shout from </div>
<div id="tm_30" class="t s1_30">the housetops that, "I don't want to be praised!" It can even decline Nobel Prizes. </div>
<div id="tn_30" class="t s1_30">That's what George Bernard Shaw did. He refused to accept the Nobel Prize on the </div>
<div id="to_30" class="t s1_30">grounds that, "Now it is below me. It is for young people -- they will be happy. I have </div>
<div id="tp_30" class="t s1_30">gone beyond all this praise, it is childish for me!" But it is an insult to the Swedish </div>
<div id="tq_30" class="t s1_30">Academy and the king. So he was pressed from all over the world, from kings and </div>
<div id="tr_30" class="t s1_30">queens and prime ministers and presidents. Those who had never written to him, they </div>
<div id="ts_30" class="t s1_30">all wrote letters to him, "Please accept it -- it is insulting to the king and to the country." </div>
<div id="tt_30" class="t s1_30">For two or three days he created much noise, and then he accepted -- on the grounds </div>
<div id="tu_30" class="t s1_30">that because so many presidents and prime ministers and kings and queens were </div>
<div id="tv_30" class="t s1_30">asking him, just to make them happy, he would accept it. Again he created a great </div>
<div id="tw_30" class="t s1_30">news, front page news. He accepted the Nobel Prize and then immediately donated it to </div>
<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">the Fabian Society. Later on it was found that he was the president of the society and he </div>
<div id="ty_30" class="t s1_30">was the only member! But he kept the world for seven or eight days continuously in his </div>
<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">grip, and when he was asked he said, "What is the point -- just getting a small corner in </div>
<div id="t10_30" class="t s1_30">the newspapers that a Nobel Prize has been awarded to George Bernard Shaw? I used </div>
<div id="t11_30" class="t s1_30">the opportunity as much as possible; I exploited the opportunity as much as possible." </div>
<div id="t12_30" class="t s1_30">It was not humbleness, it was the way of the ego. And he knew -- he was clever at it, at </div>
<div id="t13_30" class="t s1_30">the game. </div>
<div id="t14_30" class="t s1_30">Remember: the ego can sometimes say no, sometimes yes, whichever suits. It can use no </div>
<div id="t15_30" class="t s1_30">too -- it is so cunning. And love also can say sometimes yes and sometimes no, because </div>
<div id="t16_30" class="t s1_30">if the yes is going to hurt the other</div>
<div id="t17_30" class="t s1_30">....</div>
<div id="t18_30" class="t s1_30">If the child is asking to go outside and play in the </div>
