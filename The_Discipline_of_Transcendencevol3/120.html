<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">They share energies, but nobody is anybody's slave. </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">In VAJRAYANA the arrow completely disappears. There is no you and no other; </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">I and thou, both are dropped. The mechanism has to be understood. </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">When you are looking for a woman or for a man, you don't know one very </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">important factor: that your woman is within you and your man too. Each man is </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">both man and woman, and each woman is both woman and man. It has to be </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">so!... because you are born out of two parents. One was man, one was woman; </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">they have contributed to your being fifty percent each. You have something of </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">your father and you have something of your mother. Half of you belongs to the </div>

<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">fact of bisexuality, that no man is pure man and no woman is pure woman. In </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">each man a woman exists, and in fact every man is searching for that woman </div>

<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">you judge? -- it is not rational, you don't reason it out. It happens so suddenly, </div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">like a flash. You were not thinking about it, you have not reasoned it out. </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">Suddenly if somebody asks you, "Why have you fallen in love with this woman?" </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">you will shrug your shoulders. You will say, "I don't know -- but I have fallen in </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">love. Something has happened." </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">What has happened? Jung says you have an image of woman inside you; that </div>

<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">she looks, maybe her blue eyes; maybe her nose, maybe the colour of her hair. </div>
