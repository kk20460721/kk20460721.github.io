<div id="t1_232" class="t s1_232">after six years he slept for the first time without any tension. There was no </div>
<div id="t2_232" class="t s1_232">ambition. There was no desire. There was nowhere to go, nothing to be searched. </div>
<div id="t3_232" class="t s1_232">In this relaxed state, even in his sleep he became aware that he was watching his </div>
<div id="t4_232" class="t s1_232">mind; just a small flame of awareness was there. Although the body was asleep, </div>
<div id="t5_232" class="t s1_232">the mind was asleep, something beyond was alert. </div>
<div id="t6_232" class="t s1_232">And in the morning when he opened his eyes, the last star was disappearing. </div>
<div id="t7_232" class="t s1_232">And the actual fact was that as the last star was disappearing, he also </div>
<div id="t8_232" class="t s1_232">disappeared as an ego, as a personality. The enlightenment was sudden. </div>
<div id="t9_232" class="t s1_232">Suddenly he saw his authentic being. </div>
<div id="ta_232" class="t s1_232">Now the problem arose: Mahayanists say that this sudden experiment happened </div>
<div id="tb_232" class="t s1_232">because of those six years of continuous austerity -- this is gradual </div>
<div id="tc_232" class="t s1_232">enlightenment. </div>
<div id="td_232" class="t s1_232">And there are people, a certain school, who believe in sudden enlightenment. </div>
<div id="te_232" class="t s1_232">They say it had nothing to do with those six years. If he had stopped at five </div>
<div id="tf_232" class="t s1_232">years, the experience would have happened. And if somebody had told him the </div>
<div id="tg_232" class="t s1_232">very first day, and if he had had the intelligence to understand it, it would have </div>
<div id="th_232" class="t s1_232">happened the very first day he left the palace. </div>
<div id="ti_232" class="t s1_232">Those six years are not a cause for the effect of enlightenment. Enlightenment </div>
<div id="tj_232" class="t s1_232">cannot have a cause. Their reasoning is very clear. Bodhidharma has said in the </div>
<div id="tk_232" class="t s1_232">sutras that enlightenment has no cause. Then the question of millions of ages and </div>
<div id="tl_232" class="t s1_232">arduous effort is meaningless. </div>
<div id="tm_232" class="t s1_232">Enlightenment is always sudden. </div>
<div id="tn_232" class="t s1_232">If it is not sudden, it is not because the nature of enlightenment is gradual. It is </div>
<div id="to_232" class="t s1_232">because your mind leaves you gradually. You are not ready to take the risk </div>
<div id="tp_232" class="t s1_232">wholesale. You take the risk retail, inch by inch, part by part -- the American </div>
<div id="tq_232" class="t s1_232">way, in installments. A little bit you lose today, a little bit tomorrow, a little bit </div>
<div id="tr_232" class="t s1_232">....</div>
<div id="ts_232" class="t s1_232">It takes time because you are not ready to drop the mind in its totality, in this </div>
<div id="tt_232" class="t s1_232">very moment. You say, "I will do it slowly ...tomorrow, then the day after </div>
<div id="tu_232" class="t s1_232">tomorrow. What is the hurry?" </div>
<div id="tv_232" class="t s1_232">So there are these two schools: the gradual school of enlightenment which </div>
<div id="tw_232" class="t s1_232">appeals to many people because they don't have the guts to drop the mind </div>
<div id="tx_232" class="t s1_232">immediately; and the sudden school of enlightenment which belongs only to </div>
<div id="ty_232" class="t s1_232">people who have the heart of a lion, who can simply risk everything. </div>
<div id="tz_232" class="t s1_232">I remember a story about a Japanese actor. He was very famous in America and </div>
<div id="t10_232" class="t s1_232">he earned millions of dollars. He wanted to return home, he had earned enough. </div>
<div id="t11_232" class="t s1_232">But before returning home, he thought it would be better to go around the world. </div>
<div id="t12_232" class="t s1_232">Then he would not have to leave his home again. Then he wanted to rest. But </div>
<div id="t13_232" class="t s1_232">first he wanted to see every beautiful place around the world. </div>
<div id="t14_232" class="t s1_232">He reached Paris. His guide took him to many places and then he said, "Would </div>
<div id="t15_232" class="t s1_232">you like to see a casino?" The actor said, "Certainly, I want to see everything. In </div>
<div id="t16_232" class="t s1_232">Paris, not to see a casino is missing much." Casinos are gambling places and </div>
<div id="t17_232" class="t s1_232">France has the best casinos. </div>
