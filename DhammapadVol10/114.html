<div id="t4_114" class="t s1_114">the same people. Just the object of worship changes. Gods go on changing. One God </div>
<div id="t5_114" class="t s1_114">fails, another God is replaced -- but the worshipper is the same. Whether you worship </div>

<div id="t7_114" class="t s1_114">If your yes has not come as a growth to you, then it is absolutely useless. Pass through </div>
<div id="t8_114" class="t s1_114">this fire of no-saying, but remember only one thing: don't let it become a habit. It can </div>
<div id="t9_114" class="t s1_114">become a habit, that is the danger. The danger is not in no-saying. The danger is that </div>
<div id="ta_114" class="t s1_114">your no-saying may become mechanical. So say it consciously, that's all I can advise you </div>
<div id="tb_114" class="t s1_114">-- say it consciously! Just don't go on saying it because you have become accustomed. </div>
<div id="tc_114" class="t s1_114">That is as foolish as saying yes meaninglessly. If you say it as a habit, it is meaningless. </div>
<div id="td_114" class="t s1_114">There are theists and there are atheists, and they are all in the same boat. Somebody has </div>
