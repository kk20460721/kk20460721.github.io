<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">BELOVED MASTER, </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">YOU TELL US THAT AWARENESS IS ENOUGH. THEN WHY DISCOURSES, </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">GROUPS, SANNYAS? </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">Rick Ferris, how did you come to know that awareness is enough? I have to tell it again </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">and again -- that awareness is enough, that no discourse is needed. But even that has to </div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">be told to you: that nothing is needed. But you are so asleep, you won't come upon the </div>

<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">times. </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">Now see the trick of your mind: it is not that you have understood that awareness is </div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">enough. On the contrary, you have understood that discourses are not needed, groups </div>

<div id="tk_51" class="t s1_51">were playing inside the house, absolutely oblivious of the fact that the house was on </div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s1_51">fire. It was a big house and they must have been in the innermost part of the house. </div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">He shouted from the outside, because he was afraid to enter the house, but the children </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">wouldn't listen. A great crowd gathered. Then he said to the children, "Come out! See </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">what I have brought for you -- many toys. The toys that you had asked me for, I have </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">brought all, and beautiful toys!" </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">The children came running out of the house -- and he had not brought a single toy! </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">They started asking, "Where are the toys?" </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">He said, "Look at the fire! I have not brought any toys, but this was the only way to </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">bring you out of the house. The house is on fire! I was shouting that 'The house is on </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">fire!' and you were laughing and giggling. You were thinking I am playing a joke or </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">something. Yes, I have lied to you that I have brought toys for you, but the lie has </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">worked as a strategy -- it has helped you to come out. It has served a great purpose." </div>
