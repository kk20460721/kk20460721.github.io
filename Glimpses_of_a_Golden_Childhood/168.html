<div id="t1_168" class="t s1_168">CHAPTER 25.</div>
<div id="t2_168" class="t s2_168">I love stories, and all this started with my Nani. She was a lover of stories too. Not that she used</div>
<div id="t3_168" class="t s2_168">to tell me stories, just the contrary; she used to provoke me to tell her stories, all kinds of stories</div>
<div id="t4_168" class="t s2_168">and gossips. She listened so attentively that she made me into a story teller. Just for her I would</div>
<div id="t5_168" class="t s2_168">ﬁnd something interesting, because she would wait the whole day just to listen to my story. If I could</div>
<div id="t6_168" class="t s2_168">not ﬁnd anything, then I would invent. She is responsible: all credit or blame, whatsoever you call it,</div>
<div id="t7_168" class="t s2_168">goes to her. I invented stories to tell her just so she would not be disappointed, and I can promise</div>
<div id="t8_168" class="t s2_168">you that I became a successful story teller just for her sake.</div>
<div id="t9_168" class="t s2_168">I started winning in competitions when I was just a child in primary school, and that continued to</div>
<div id="ta_168" class="t s2_168">the very end, when I left university. I collected so many prizes, medals and cups and shields and</div>
<div id="tb_168" class="t s2_168">whatnot, that my grandmother became just a young girl again. Whenever she would bring someone</div>
<div id="tc_168" class="t s2_168">to show them my prizes and awards, she was no longer an old woman, she became almost young</div>
<div id="td_168" class="t s2_168">again.</div>
<div id="te_168" class="t s2_168">Her whole house became almost a museum because I went on sending her my prizes. Up till high</div>
<div id="tf_168" class="t s2_168">school, of course, I was almost a resident in her house. It was just for courtesy’s sake that I used to</div>
<div id="tg_168" class="t s2_168">visit my parents in the daytime; but the night was hers, because that was the time to tell the stories.</div>
<div id="th_168" class="t s2_168">I can still see myself by the side of her bed, with her listening so attentively to what I was saying.</div>
<div id="ti_168" class="t s2_168">Each word uttered by me was absorbed by her as if it were of immense value.</div>
<div id="tj_168" class="t s2_168">And it became</div>
<div id="tk_168" class="t s2_168">valuable just because she took it in with so much love and respect. When it had knocked on my</div>
<div id="tl_168" class="t s2_168">door it was just a beggar, but when it entered into her house, it was no longer the same person. The</div>
<div id="tm_168" class="t s2_168">moment she called me, saying, ”Raja! Now tell me what happened to you today – the whole thing –</div>
<div id="tn_168" class="t s2_168">promise me you will not leave out anything at all,” the beggar dropped all that made him look like a</div>
<div id="to_168" class="t s2_168">beggar; now he was a king.</div>
<div id="tp_168" class="t s2_168">Every day I had to promise her, and even though I told her everything that happened, she would</div>
<div id="tq_168" class="t s2_168">insist, ”Tell me something more,” or ”Tell me that one again.”</div>
<div id="tr_168" class="t s2_168">Many times I said to her, ”You will spoil me; both you and Shambhu Babu are spoiling me forever.”</div>
<div id="ts_168" class="t s2_168">And they really did their job well. I collected hundreds of awards. There was not a single high school</div>
<div id="tt_168" class="t s2_168">in the whole state where I had not spoken and won – except once. Only once had I not been the</div>
<div id="tu_168" class="t s2_168">winner, and the reason was simple. Everybody was amazed, even the girl who had won, because,</div>
<div id="tv_168" class="t s2_168">she said to me, ”It is impossible to think I could win against you.”</div>
<div id="tw_168" class="t s2_168">The whole hall – and there must have been at least two thousand students – became full of a great</div>
<div id="tx_168" class="t s2_168">humming, and everybody was saying that it was unfair, even the principal who was presiding over</div>
<div id="ty_168" class="t s2_168">the contest. Losing that cup became very signiﬁcant to me; in fact, if I had not lost that cup, I would</div>
<div id="tz_168" class="t s2_168">have been in great trouble. Of that I will tell you when the time comes.</div>
<div id="t10_168" class="t s2_168">The principal called me and said, ”I am sorry – you are certainly the winner,” and he gave his own</div>
<div id="t11_168" class="t s2_168">watch to me saying, ”This is far more costly than the cup which was given to that girl.” And it certainly</div>
<div id="t12_168" class="t s2_168">was. It was a gold watch. I have received thousands of watches, but I have never again received</div>
<div id="t13_168" class="t s2_168">such a beautiful one; it was a real masterpiece. That principal was very interested in rare things,</div>
<div id="t14_168" class="t s2_168">and his watch was a rare piece.</div>
<div id="t15_168" class="t s2_168">I can still see it. I have received so many watches, but I have forgotten them.</div>
<div id="t16_168" class="t s2_168">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t17_168" class="t s2_168">168</div>
<div id="t18_168" class="t s3_168">Osho</div>
