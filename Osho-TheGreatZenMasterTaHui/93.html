<div id="t1_93" class="t s1_93">In my childhood I came across a man. His name was Sardar Chanchal Singh. He had been</div>
<div id="t2_93" class="t s1_93">with Subhash Chandra Bose, a great Indian revolutionary, who had escaped from the jails of</div>
<div id="t3_93" class="t s1_93">the British government. He had gone first in disguise to Germany to see Adolf Hitler, because</div>
<div id="t4_93" class="t s1_93">he wanted to suggest, "You are fighting with the British. We are also fighting them, and we</div>
<div id="t5_93" class="t s1_93">need your help. If you can give us help, the British Empire can be attacked from two sides.</div>
<div id="t6_93" class="t s1_93">We can attack from inside and you can go on attacking it from the outside."</div>
<div id="t7_93" class="t s1_93">The policy was absolutely clear ... and you will be surprised, Adolf Hitler never introduced</div>
<div id="t8_93" class="t s1_93">any man to his armies the way he introduced Subhash Chandra Bose. He said to the armies,</div>
<div id="t9_93" class="t s1_93">"Respect this man more than you respect me, because I am a fuhrer of only a small nation; this</div>
<div id="ta_93" class="t s1_93">man is a revolutionary and the leader of a vast continent." And he gave him -- although he was</div>
<div id="tb_93" class="t s1_93">not in any political position -- a guard of honor.</div>
<div id="tc_93" class="t s1_93">It was Adolf Hitler and Subhash Chandra's plan ... they worked out that it would be better</div>
<div id="td_93" class="t s1_93">that Subhash Chandra went to Japan. In Japan there were thousands of Indian soldiers who</div>
<div id="te_93" class="t s1_93">were fighting for the British government against Japan.</div>
<div id="tf_93" class="t s1_93">It was a very clever policy: Subhash Chandra would go to Japan and Hitler would inform</div>
<div id="tg_93" class="t s1_93">Japan -- because Japan was an ally with Germany against the British, against the Americans ...</div>
<div id="th_93" class="t s1_93">He would inform them, "Allow Subhash to talk to all the Indian soldiers who are prisoners in</div>
<div id="ti_93" class="t s1_93">Japanese jails. I have every certainty that this man is capable." -- and he was a man of</div>
<div id="tj_93" class="t s1_93">immense charisma -- "and that he will convince those soldiers, 'You are fighting for the</div>
<div id="tk_93" class="t s1_93">British empire, which keeps your slavery intact. Instead, come with me, and we will make an</div>
<div id="tl_93" class="t s1_93">army and fight against the British Empire.'"</div>
<div id="tm_93" class="t s1_93">It was so logical and simple that the prisoners were ready. First ... if they are ready, they</div>
<div id="tn_93" class="t s1_93">will not be prisoners any more; they will be guests of Japan. Secondly, they may have been</div>
<div id="to_93" class="t s1_93">fighting for the British, but deep down they were against the empire; just for their bread and</div>
<div id="tp_93" class="t s1_93">butter, they had sold their souls.</div>
<div id="tq_93" class="t s1_93">Once Subhash told them, "You have sold your souls ..." then all the camps of prisoners</div>
<div id="tr_93" class="t s1_93">were opened. A new army -- the Indian National Army -- was created by Subhash Chandra</div>
<div id="ts_93" class="t s1_93">Bose. Sardar Chanchal Singh was one of the close colleagues of Subhash. He was also a</div>
<div id="tt_93" class="t s1_93">prisoner. He had had a high post in the Indian army, and he also had a very high post in the</div>
<div id="tu_93" class="t s1_93">Indian National Army that was going to attack from Japan.</div>
<div id="tv_93" class="t s1_93">They succeeded as far as Rangoon; they defeated the British armies. Even Calcutta started</div>
<div id="tw_93" class="t s1_93">feeling the fear that after Rangoon the next attack would be on Calcutta. All British were</div>
<div id="tx_93" class="t s1_93">removed from Calcutta, and people who had enough money all moved from there. Calcutta</div>
<div id="ty_93" class="t s1_93">was a danger point.</div>
<div id="tz_93" class="t s1_93">At that very moment Germany was defeated. Atom bombs were thrown on Hiroshima and</div>
<div id="t10_93" class="t s1_93">Nagasaki, so Japan surrendered.</div>
<div id="t11_93" class="t s1_93">Subhash was in a strange position. Now, both friends who were supporting him were</div>
<div id="t12_93" class="t s1_93">defeated. He had a small army -- but although he was winning, how long could he go on? He</div>
<div id="t13_93" class="t s1_93">could not even reach Calcutta, which was his home town. So he escaped from Rangoon ...</div>
<div id="t14_93" class="t s1_93">It is still a mystery what happened to him. There are stories that he has been seen in the</div>
<div id="t15_93" class="t s1_93">Soviet Union; there are stories that he lives in Tibet; there are stories which seem to have been</div>
<div id="t16_93" class="t s1_93">created by himself ... The plane he had taken from Rangoon fell in Taipei and burned. The</div>
<div id="t17_93" class="t s1_93">pilot and somebody else -- nobody knows who the other man was -- were immediately burned,</div>
<div id="t18_93" class="t s1_93">Chapter 7 - The source</div>
<div id="t19_93" class="t s1_93">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
