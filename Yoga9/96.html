<div id="t1_96" class="t s1_96">Time goes very, very fast when you are happy. When you are unhappy -- somebody has </div>
<div id="t2_96" class="t s1_96">died, somebody you loved, death has happened -- then time goes very, very, very slowly. </div>
<div id="t3_96" class="t s1_96">Just the other night Meera came. Her husband died a few months before. She had come to </div>
<div id="t4_96" class="t s1_96">see me after the death, and I had told her don't be worried, the wound will heal. It will </div>
<div id="t5_96" class="t s1_96">take a little time, almost three months. But those three months were just an average </div>
<div id="t6_96" class="t s1_96">because it will depend on the person. Now she came last night again and she said, "Now </div>
<div id="t7_96" class="t s1_96">five months have passed and the pain is still there. Of course it is less, but it is still there, </div>
<div id="t8_96" class="t s1_96">it has not gone; and you had said that within three months it will go." I know. Sometimes </div>
<div id="t9_96" class="t s1_96">it will take one year, sometimes it will take six months, sometimes it may not even take </div>
<div id="ta_96" class="t s1_96">three months, three days will do. It is not chronological; it is psychological. It depends on </div>
<div id="tb_96" class="t s1_96">you, on the relationship, what type of relationship existed between you and your husband. </div>
<div id="tc_96" class="t s1_96">And I know the relationship was not good. That's why the wound will heal and it will </div>
<div id="td_96" class="t s1_96">take a long time. This will look paradoxical, but this is how it is. If you have loved a man </div>
<div id="te_96" class="t s1_96">and he dies, you will feel sad, but you will recover -- soon. There will be no wound. You </div>
<div id="tf_96" class="t s1_96">loved the man; nothing is incomplete. But between Meera and her husband the </div>
<div id="tg_96" class="t s1_96">relationship was not good; for years they were almost separate. She wanted to love but </div>
<div id="th_96" class="t s1_96">could not love. She wanted to be with him but could not be. Now the husband is gone, </div>
<div id="ti_96" class="t s1_96">and all her hope to be with him is gone with him. She hankered, she desired, she wanted, </div>
<div id="tj_96" class="t s1_96">and it couldn't happen. Now the man is gone; now there is no possibility. Now her </div>
<div id="tk_96" class="t s1_96">aloneness is sealed, now there is no way to love this man. He was alive, she could not </div>
<div id="tl_96" class="t s1_96">love, there were problems between them; now the man is gone, so there is no possibility. </div>
<div id="tm_96" class="t s1_96">Now this wound is going to heal very slowly -- very, very slowly. And even when it is </div>
<div id="tn_96" class="t s1_96">healed there will remain a certain sadness around it forever. </div>
<div id="to_96" class="t s1_96">Anything incomplete is very difficult to drop. Complete things ripen and fall on their own </div>
<div id="tp_96" class="t s1_96">accord. When a fruit is ripe it falls. Of course the tree feels for a few seconds something </div>
<div id="tq_96" class="t s1_96">is missing, and then it forgets. Finished, because ripe fruits have to fall. Everybody has to </div>
<div id="tr_96" class="t s1_96">die. You loved while the man was alive -- and you loved tremendously and totally. You </div>
<div id="ts_96" class="t s1_96">are almost fulfilled; you cannot ask for more. As it was, it was already too much. You are </div>
<div id="tt_96" class="t s1_96">grateful that God gave you that much time. He could have taken the man a little earlier, </div>
<div id="tu_96" class="t s1_96">but he gave you enough time, and you loved and you loved. In love even a single moment </div>
<div id="tv_96" class="t s1_96">becomes eternity. You are so happy time stops. A small life becomes very, very intimate. </div>
<div id="tw_96" class="t s1_96">But that has not happened, so I can understand Meera's misery. </div>
<div id="tx_96" class="t s1_96">But she has to face it and understand it. It is not only a question of the death of the </div>
<div id="ty_96" class="t s1_96">husband. That is not such a big problem. Husbands die, wives die; that is not a big </div>
<div id="tz_96" class="t s1_96">problem, that is natural. The problem is that love could not happen. It remained a dream, </div>
<div id="t10_96" class="t s1_96">a desire, and now it is going to remain unfulfilled. You cannot find that man again, so </div>
<div id="t11_96" class="t s1_96">that chapter cannot be completed. This incompletion will function as a wound. That's </div>
<div id="t12_96" class="t s1_96">why it has taken a longer time. It will take a little longer still. </div>
<div id="t13_96" class="t s1_96">Psychological time is your inner time; and we live in the chronological time altogether, </div>
<div id="t14_96" class="t s1_96">the Greenwich time -- it is not personal. Psychological time is personal, and each has his </div>
<div id="t15_96" class="t s1_96">own. If you are happy, your sense of time slows down. If you are unhappy time </div>
<div id="t16_96" class="t s1_96">lengthens. If you are deep in meditation time stops. In fact in the East we have been </div>
<div id="t17_96" class="t s1_96">measuring states of mind through time. If time stops completely, then the state is of bliss. </div>
<div id="t18_96" class="t s1_96">If time slows down very much, then the state of misery. </div>
<div id="t19_96" class="t s1_96">In Christianity it is said that hell is eternal. Bertrand Russell has written a book, WHY I </div>
<div id="t1a_96" class="t s1_96">AM NOT A CHRISTIAN, in which he gives many arguments why he is not a Christian. </div>
