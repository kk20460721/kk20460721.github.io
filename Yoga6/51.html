<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">You cannot even invite a friend. You cannot even invite your beloved in your </div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">dreams. You have to be alone there. Why are dreams thought to be unreal? </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">Because they are private. You cannot call anybody else to become a witness to </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">your dreams, that is impossible. </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">I have heard that one Pharaoh of Egypt, who was a little eccentric, as kings are </div>

<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">ministers in his dream. He was very angry. The next day he had an order </div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s1_51">proclaimed all over the kingdom that nobody is allowed to enter in his dreams. </div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">This is trespassing; and if somebody is found trespassing, entering in his dreams, </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">he will be immediately killed. And many persons were killed later on because </div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">they entered in his dreams. </div>

<div id="th_51" class="t s1_51">I can see. I cannot ask you to come and become a witness. That's why in the </div>
