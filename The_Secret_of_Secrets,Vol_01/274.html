<div id="t1_274" class="t s1_274">CHAPTER 16. IN THE LAKE OF THE VOID</div>
<div id="t2_274" class="t s2_274">betray the Master very easily. Judas was the closest disciple of Jesus, the most intelligent, educated</div>
<div id="t3_274" class="t s2_274">disciple – more intelligent, more educated than anybody else. In fact, more educated than Jesus</div>
<div id="t4_274" class="t s2_274">himself. He was the most sophisticated one. And, of course, he was hoping that he would be the</div>
<div id="t5_274" class="t s2_274">second: that after Jesus was gone, he would be the leader. He was next to Jesus, and naturally</div>
<div id="t6_274" class="t s2_274">a deep jealousy and ego started arising in him – why couldn’t he be the ﬁrst? How long had he to</div>
<div id="t7_274" class="t s2_274">wait? And he knew more; he was more articulate than Jesus – Jesus was uneducated. Naturally, he</div>
<div id="t8_274" class="t s2_274">must have started thinking in these terms. And the conﬂict arose. He must have been very egoistic.</div>
<div id="t9_274" class="t s2_274">And it is not that it has happened only once, it has happened many times. It happened with Mahavira;</div>
<div id="ta_274" class="t s2_274">his own son-in-law betrayed him. He was his disciple and then left with ﬁve hundred other disciples.</div>
<div id="tb_274" class="t s2_274">Buddha’s own cousin-brother, Devadatta, betrayed him. He tried to murder Buddha, poison him.</div>
<div id="tc_274" class="t s2_274">Why? – because Devadatta was always thinking that he was as good as Buddha, ’So why is Buddha</div>
<div id="td_274" class="t s2_274">respected so much, and why not me? We have grown up together, we have been educated by the</div>
<div id="te_274" class="t s2_274">same teachers, we are both from the same family, the same royal family, why has he become the</div>
<div id="tf_274" class="t s2_274">enlightened one and I am still a disciple?’ He wanted to declare himself also an enlightened one. It</div>
<div id="tg_274" class="t s2_274">was ambition, it was jealousy, it was ego.</div>
<div id="th_274" class="t s2_274">And the same was the case with Jung and Adler and a few others. Freud is a revolution. Freud</div>
<div id="ti_274" class="t s2_274">is a milestone in the history of human consciousness, a great transforming force – not himself</div>
<div id="tj_274" class="t s2_274">enlightened like Buddha or Mahavira or Jesus, but a great revolutionary as far as thinking is</div>
<div id="tk_274" class="t s2_274">concerned, and he has opened a door which makes many things possible. Without Freud it would</div>
<div id="tl_274" class="t s2_274">not have been possible for Tantra to be understood by the West. Without Freud the Western man</div>
<div id="tm_274" class="t s2_274">would have lived with Victorian puritanism, with Victorian pseudoness, hypocrisy. Freud opened the</div>
<div id="tn_274" class="t s2_274">doors for man to be more real, to be more authentic, to be more honest and true.</div>
<div id="to_274" class="t s2_274">Jung and Adler are just offshoots. Jung was second to Freud. Freud himself had chosen him as</div>
<div id="tp_274" class="t s2_274">his successor – that’s why I say he is almost like a Judas. But Freud missed. In the very choice he</div>
<div id="tq_274" class="t s2_274">missed. He himself was not enlightened; he must have chosen the most egoistic because the most</div>
<div id="tr_274" class="t s2_274">egoistic is the most active. Jung was the most egoistic. You can look at the old pictures of him with</div>
<div id="ts_274" class="t s2_274">Freud and with the other disciples. Jung seems to be the most egoistic. Even in pictures he cannot</div>
<div id="tt_274" class="t s2_274">hide it; it is impossible to hide – it is written all over his face.</div>
<div id="tu_274" class="t s2_274">Freud must have chosen him because he was articulate, talented, active, tremendously active. He</div>
<div id="tv_274" class="t s2_274">was able to philosophize, speculate, argue. But all those qualities were such that sooner or later</div>
<div id="tw_274" class="t s2_274">Jung became aware that he could become a master in his own right, he could start a new school of</div>
<div id="tx_274" class="t s2_274">psychology in his own right. Why should he bother to play second ﬁddle? He could be the ﬁrst, the</div>
<div id="ty_274" class="t s2_274">foremost. He started his own school.</div>
<div id="tz_274" class="t s2_274">His school is just a reaction, a reaction to Freud.</div>
<div id="t10_274" class="t s2_274">And his understanding never went very deep,</div>
<div id="t11_274" class="t s2_274">although he was groping in the right direction. But, I repeat, it was groping. He was not conscious of</div>
<div id="t12_274" class="t s2_274">it, he was just moving as far away from Freud as possible. Freud had a very scientiﬁc attitude. Jung</div>
<div id="t13_274" class="t s2_274">started moving into the world of art – just to be away from Freud. By accident he started moving</div>
<div id="t14_274" class="t s2_274">in the right direction. Freud was very mathematical, Jung started becoming poetic. Freud was very</div>
<div id="t15_274" class="t s2_274">factual,Jung started becoming more and more mythological. This was because of reaction. He had</div>
<div id="t16_274" class="t s2_274">to prove himself separate, utterly separate from Freud. He had to drop all kind of links with Freud.</div>
<div id="t17_274" class="t s2_274">He had to become his polar opposite, unknowingly, unconsciously.</div>
<div id="t18_274" class="t s2_274">But, in a way, it was good. It was good in the sense that he stumbled upon a few facts which Freud</div>
<div id="t19_274" class="t s2_274">The Secret of Secrets, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t1a_274" class="t s2_274">274</div>
<div id="t1b_274" class="t s3_274">Osho</div>
