<div id="t1_169" class="t s1_169">THROUGH ALL REALMS, WHILE SENTIENT BEINGS EACH OBTAINED</div>
<div id="t2_169" class="t s1_169">BENEFITS ACCORDING TO THEIR KIND. IT IS LIKE: "ONE GUST OF THE EAST</div>
<div id="t3_169" class="t s1_169">WIND,.. The quotation is from Gautam Buddha but so beautiful and so poetic ... "ONE GUST</div>
<div id="t4_169" class="t s1_169">OF THE EAST WIND, AND THE MYRIAD GRASSES ALL BEND DOWN."</div>
<div id="t5_169" class="t s1_169">Just when I come in and I see you bending down I remember the statement of Gautam</div>
<div id="t6_169" class="t s1_169">Buddha: "ONE GUST OF THE EAST WIND, AND ALL THE GRASSES BEND DOWN."</div>
<div id="t7_169" class="t s1_169">A man of enlightenment is nothing but a gust of the east wind. Just his being present is</div>
<div id="t8_169" class="t s1_169">enough for those who are capable of some intelligence, who are not prejudiced, who are open</div>
<div id="t9_169" class="t s1_169">and available like the open sky, and who are as innocent as the trees, as the grasses ... it is</div>
<div id="ta_169" class="t s1_169">irresistible not to bow down. You are not stone statues. But there are idiots in the world ...</div>
<div id="tb_169" class="t s1_169">Just a few days ago there were seventy people from THE TIMES OF INDIA group of</div>
<div id="tc_169" class="t s1_169">papers. This is the biggest organization of papers, the biggest network, in India -- and the</div>
<div id="td_169" class="t s1_169">oldest. The owners were all here except for one person, the owner himself, who has been in</div>
<div id="te_169" class="t s1_169">love with me for a long time, since when he was a small child and I used to stay in their house</div>
<div id="tf_169" class="t s1_169">in Calcutta.</div>
<div id="tg_169" class="t s1_169">He wanted to become a sannyasin -- he had been here in the ashram before for a few days</div>
<div id="th_169" class="t s1_169">to meditate, but his father is very much against me. For two reasons his father is against me.</div>
<div id="ti_169" class="t s1_169">First, that boy is his only son, and they are one of the topmost super-rich people in India. He is</div>
<div id="tj_169" class="t s1_169">afraid that his son becomes a sannyasin, then who is going to take over his great empire? And</div>
<div id="tk_169" class="t s1_169">the fear that he may start helping the movement with his money ... And secondly he was angry</div>
<div id="tl_169" class="t s1_169">with me, although we had not even quarreled or harmed each other. He was so afraid of me</div>
<div id="tm_169" class="t s1_169">that when I used to stay in their house -- because his wife has always been interested in me --</div>
<div id="tn_169" class="t s1_169">he would go out of town immediately. Until I left their house he would not come home again.</div>
<div id="to_169" class="t s1_169">Just a casual encounter and there may be some trouble ...</div>
<div id="tp_169" class="t s1_169">The second reason for his antagonism towards me was that his wife had asked me, "When</div>
<div id="tq_169" class="t s1_169">a wife ceases to love the husband, is it right to sleep with him?"</div>
<div id="tr_169" class="t s1_169">I said, "That is prostitution! One has to be very sincere about it. If you don't love him, you</div>
<div id="ts_169" class="t s1_169">have to say it. Don't try to pretend -- at least in matters like love."</div>
<div id="tt_169" class="t s1_169">Then she asked me, "If the wife loves somebody else ...?"</div>
<div id="tu_169" class="t s1_169">I said, "Love is the highest law, and you should not be dominated by any lower law of</div>
<div id="tv_169" class="t s1_169">morality, of society. When you are following the highest law, nothing goes wrong."</div>
<div id="tw_169" class="t s1_169">She was asking these questions not just out of curiosity or for somebody else; she was</div>
<div id="tx_169" class="t s1_169">asking for herself. The husband was angry that I had supported his wife, and he was worried --</div>
<div id="ty_169" class="t s1_169">the wife is already impressed with me, the son is impressed and the daughter is impressed.</div>
<div id="tz_169" class="t s1_169">So he prevented the son, made it clear that, "If you become a sannyasin I will disown you.</div>
<div id="t10_169" class="t s1_169">With my money you cannot help a movement that I don't like, a man who has been disturbing</div>
<div id="t11_169" class="t s1_169">our old tradition, our religion, our morality and who is corrupting the mind of the youth." Now</div>
<div id="t12_169" class="t s1_169">the son has become the director of THE TIMES OF INDIA group of papers, and the daughter</div>
<div id="t13_169" class="t s1_169">also -- associate director.</div>
<div id="t14_169" class="t s1_169">So they were here, the mother was here, and seventy people from the staff. They insisted</div>
<div id="t15_169" class="t s1_169">that they wanted their questions to be answered. I agreed, because of a long relationship with</div>
<div id="t16_169" class="t s1_169">their family. But when I came in I was surprised, those seventy persons were sitting like stone</div>
<div id="t17_169" class="t s1_169">statues. They could not even answer my greeting, with folded hands. I was initiating the</div>
<div id="t18_169" class="t s1_169">Chapter 13 - Nothingness</div>
<div id="t19_169" class="t s1_169">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1a_169" class="t s1_169">169</div>
