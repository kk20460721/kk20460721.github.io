<div id="t1_166" class="t s1_166">CHAPTER 15. THE IMPOSSIBLE IS ONLY AN IDEA OF THE MIND</div>
<div id="t2_166" class="t s2_166">All lines of communication are completely blocked, but what old people are doing – condemning the</div>
<div id="t3_166" class="t s2_166">new generation – is wrong. I can see the reason why things have changed. The new generation</div>
<div id="t4_166" class="t s2_166">is not responsible. It is not their crime. It is simply a totally different set of circumstances. And the</div>
<div id="t5_166" class="t s2_166">older generation should show a little more understanding, a little more clarity, a little more readiness</div>
<div id="t6_166" class="t s2_166">to listen to the new generation, because they are the future. In the past, the past used to rule the</div>
<div id="t7_166" class="t s2_166">future. Now things are otherwise: the future is going to rule over everything.</div>
<div id="t8_166" class="t s2_166">I have been a teacher and I have been attending conferences of professors of the universities. And</div>
<div id="t9_166" class="t s2_166">the whole problem to them was: how to create discipline, how to create respect? The students were</div>
<div id="ta_166" class="t s2_166">getting out of hand, no discipline, no respect. I was the only exception. Finally they started dropping</div>
<div id="tb_166" class="t s2_166">me from their conferences, because I said to them, ”The whole responsibility is yours.”</div>
<div id="tc_166" class="t s2_166">In the past there were children married before they were ten. Sometimes children were even married</div>
<div id="td_166" class="t s2_166">when they were still in their mother’s womb.</div>
<div id="te_166" class="t s2_166">Just two friends will decide that, ”As our wives are</div>
<div id="tf_166" class="t s2_166">pregnant, if one gives birth to a boy and the other gives birth to a girl, then the marriage is settled,</div>
<div id="tg_166" class="t s2_166">promised.” The question of asking the boy and the girl does not arise at all. They are not even born</div>
<div id="th_166" class="t s2_166">yet. They are not even certain yet whether both may be girls, both may be boys. But if one is a boy</div>
<div id="ti_166" class="t s2_166">and another is a girl, the marriage is settled.</div>
<div id="tj_166" class="t s2_166">And people kept their word, their promises. My own mother was married when she was seven years</div>
<div id="tk_166" class="t s2_166">old. And her parents had to tie her to a pillar inside the house when the marriage party was coming</div>
<div id="tl_166" class="t s2_166">and there were many ﬁreworks. And at the reception there was music and dance. And everybody</div>
<div id="tm_166" class="t s2_166">was out of the house, and my mother reminds me still that, ”I could not understand why only I was left</div>
<div id="tn_166" class="t s2_166">inside the house and tied! They wouldn’t let me go out.” She had no understanding what marriage</div>
<div id="to_166" class="t s2_166">was. She wanted to see, like any child, everything beautiful that was happening outside – the whole</div>
<div id="tp_166" class="t s2_166">village had gathered, and she was crying.</div>
<div id="tq_166" class="t s2_166">My father was not more than ten years old, and he had no understanding of what was happening. I</div>
<div id="tr_166" class="t s2_166">used to ask him, ”What was the most signiﬁcant thing that you enjoyed in your wedding?”</div>
<div id="ts_166" class="t s2_166">He said, ”Riding on the horse.” Naturally, for the ﬁrst time he was dressed like a king, with a knife</div>
<div id="tt_166" class="t s2_166">hanging by his side, and he was sitting on the horse, and everybody was walking around. He enjoyed</div>
<div id="tu_166" class="t s2_166">it tremendously. That was the most important thing that he enjoyed in his wedding.</div>
<div id="tv_166" class="t s2_166">A honeymoon was out of the question. Where will you send a ten-year-old boy and a seven-year-old</div>
<div id="tw_166" class="t s2_166">girl for a honeymoon? So in India the honeymoon never used to exist, and in the past, nowhere else</div>
<div id="tx_166" class="t s2_166">in the world either.</div>
<div id="ty_166" class="t s2_166">And when my father was ten years old and my mother was seven years old, my father’s mother died.</div>
<div id="tz_166" class="t s2_166">After the marriage, perhaps one or two years afterwards, the whole responsibility fell on my mother,</div>
<div id="t10_166" class="t s2_166">who was only nine years old. Two small daughters my father’s mother had left, and two small boys.</div>
<div id="t11_166" class="t s2_166">So four children, and the responsibility on a nine-year-old girl and a twelve-year-old son.</div>
<div id="t12_166" class="t s2_166">My grandfather never liked to live in the city where he had his shop. He loved the countryside. He</div>
<div id="t13_166" class="t s2_166">had his own beautiful horse. And when his wife died he was absolutely free. You will not believe</div>
<div id="t14_166" class="t s2_166">it, but in his time – and it is not long ago – the government used to give land to people for free.</div>
<div id="t15_166" class="t s2_166">Because there was so much land, and there were not so many people to cultivate it.</div>
<div id="t16_166" class="t s2_166">Sat Chit Anand</div>
<div id="t17_166" class="t s2_166">166</div>
<div id="t18_166" class="t s3_166">Osho</div>
