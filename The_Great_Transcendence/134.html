<div id="t1_134" class="t s1_134">CHAPTER 8. THE WORLD IS A SCHOOL</div>
<div id="t2_134" class="t s2_134">Your so-called sadhus and sannyasins do all sort of austerities and renunciations just to satisfy their</div>
<div id="t3_134" class="t s2_134">egos. They have not attained any heaven; it is nothing else but ego gratiﬁcation. To enjoy their ego</div>
<div id="t4_134" class="t s2_134">trip it is necessary for them to indulge in things which are just opposite to you. Whatever you do,</div>
<div id="t5_134" class="t s2_134">they will do the opposite. And you are very impressed by these things – you think that they have</div>
<div id="t6_134" class="t s2_134">done miracles. You are idiotic, but they are more idiotic than you. You are standing on your feet</div>
<div id="t7_134" class="t s2_134">and they are standing on their heads, and they say that they are doing shirshasan, the headstand.</div>
<div id="t8_134" class="t s2_134">Man is meant to walk on his feet, otherwise God would have made arrangements for him to walk on</div>
<div id="t9_134" class="t s2_134">his head. There is no need to stand on your head, but the one who is doing it can certainly look</div>
<div id="ta_134" class="t s2_134">down upon you thinking that he is doing something wonderful, something great, and that you are</div>
<div id="tb_134" class="t s2_134">standing on your feet like ignorant fools. And the fact is that those persons who have egos are highly</div>
<div id="tc_134" class="t s2_134">impressed by the exhibition of such a type of ego and they also start doing the yoga postures.</div>
<div id="td_134" class="t s2_134">Now you are asking, ”How to remove the complex by sadhana?” I do not see any complex in you</div>
<div id="te_134" class="t s2_134">which has to be removed. You are just as you should be – just forget the illusion of complex. The day</div>
<div id="tf_134" class="t s2_134">you give up this illusion of a complex you will be surprised to realize that you were always without it</div>
<div id="tg_134" class="t s2_134">and you wasted time under this illusion.</div>
<div id="th_134" class="t s2_134">When Buddha became enlightened the ﬁrst sentence he said was, ”Oh Lord, the maker of the</div>
<div id="ti_134" class="t s2_134">houses of desire. Now you will not have to make any more houses for me, because I have caught</div>
<div id="tj_134" class="t s2_134">the source of desire and the source of desire is imagination. I have understood that this was all the</div>
<div id="tk_134" class="t s2_134">web of my imagination. But now I have found the original source – the imagination! Now that journey</div>
<div id="tl_134" class="t s2_134">of desires has stopped.”</div>
<div id="tm_134" class="t s2_134">Your complex is in your imagination. Your desire is also in your imagination. Your world is also in</div>
<div id="tn_134" class="t s2_134">your imagination. Truth is always as it was. Even now it is the same, even tomorrow it will be the</div>
<div id="to_134" class="t s2_134">same. The day you drop this web of imagination you will realize that you missed a lot of joy in vain.</div>
<div id="tp_134" class="t s2_134">But there are hypochondriacs – you must also know some of them – who go on creating disease</div>
<div id="tq_134" class="t s2_134">after disease. They are always running to doctors. Sometimes they are running to the allopathic</div>
<div id="tr_134" class="t s2_134">doctor, sometimes to the homeopath, sometimes to the naturopath and sometimes to the ayurved.</div>
<div id="ts_134" class="t s2_134">They are never at rest, they are always running to different places for treatment, and everywhere</div>
<div id="tt_134" class="t s2_134">they are told that they do not have any disease. But they get very upset to hear this and they say,</div>
<div id="tu_134" class="t s2_134">”We are suffering so much from these diseases, and you say we have no disease!” They can be</div>
<div id="tv_134" class="t s2_134">satisﬁed only if they are told that they are suffering from a very serious and dangerous disease –</div>
<div id="tw_134" class="t s2_134">”You are the ﬁrst one to get it, and such a rare disease.”</div>
<div id="tx_134" class="t s2_134">I have heard about an old woman who was always complaining about being ill, but nobody believed</div>
<div id="ty_134" class="t s2_134">her because actually she was not ill. And if the doctor treated her for one particular disease she</div>
<div id="tz_134" class="t s2_134">would start complaining about others – either she had a headache or her hands and feet ached or</div>
<div id="t10_134" class="t s2_134">her whole body ached. Certainly, there is no end to imaginary diseases. At last she died, but before</div>
<div id="t11_134" class="t s2_134">dying she told the people that the inscription on her grave should be, ”Now you must believe that I</div>
<div id="t12_134" class="t s2_134">was ill.” Now she has died, so people must believe that she died because of her disease.</div>
<div id="t13_134" class="t s2_134">Once a mentally unbalanced man was brought to me. He was a healthy young man but he was</div>
<div id="t14_134" class="t s2_134">suffering from the idea that two ﬂies had entered his body through his nose while he was sleeping.</div>
<div id="t15_134" class="t s2_134">Now they go on buzzing inside him and because of them he cannot eat, he cannot sleep, he feels</div>
<div id="t16_134" class="t s2_134">uncomfortable all the time. All sorts of treatments had been given to him but they had no effect on</div>
<div id="t17_134" class="t s2_134">The Great Transcendence</div>
<div id="t18_134" class="t s2_134">134</div>
