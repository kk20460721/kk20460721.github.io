<div id="t8_42" class="t s1_42">you will be repaid, rewarded. And of course one has to pay for everything. The desire is </div>

<div id="tn_42" class="t s1_42">continuously, and it had never happened like that. It was simply rare, unique. All the </div>
<div id="to_42" class="t s1_42">three passengers were such great snorers. </div>
<div id="tp_42" class="t s1_42">First the one on the lower berth started, and then the second started responding to him, </div>
<div id="tq_42" class="t s1_42">almost answering. It was like a duet. I was surprised. And then the third started and he </div>
<div id="tr_42" class="t s1_42">was something... those two were nothing, just learners, beginners. And they all snored </div>
<div id="ts_42" class="t s1_42">in such a way as if they were answering each other. It was a great discussion. I could </div>
<div id="tt_42" class="t s1_42">not sleep for one or two hours. I waited, and there was no way. </div>
<div id="tu_42" class="t s1_42">Then I started acting -- snoring so loudly, fully awake, that all the three started asking </div>
<div id="tv_42" class="t s1_42">me, "Please, you are snoring too loudly." </div>
<div id="tw_42" class="t s1_42">I said, "Yes, I know it, because I am not asleep. Unless you all three stop, I am going to </div>
<div id="tx_42" class="t s1_42">make this night a hell for you!" </div>
<div id="ty_42" class="t s1_42">But the way they were snoring was something worth witnessing, almost like answering </div>
<div id="tz_42" class="t s1_42">each other. Great messages were being passed, and they followed the general format of </div>
<div id="t10_42" class="t s1_42">a dialogue: when one was snoring the other two were silent. Then the second would </div>
<div id="t11_42" class="t s1_42">start and the other two would listen -- and then the third would start, and the </div>
<div id="t12_42" class="t s1_42">remaining two would be silent. They knew how to converse. </div>
<div id="t13_42" class="t s1_42">You can understand people who are asleep more easily because they use the same </div>
