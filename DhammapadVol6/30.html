<div id="t1_30" class="t s1_30">God loves the world. It is his creation. To deny it is to deny him. If you deny the </div>
<div id="t2_30" class="t s1_30">painting, you have denied the painter. If you condemn the poetry, you have </div>
<div id="t3_30" class="t s1_30">condemned the poet. If you reject the dance, you have rejected the dancer. And this </div>
<div id="t4_30" class="t s1_30">stupid logic has been going on for centuries: accept God, praise God, and deny life! And </div>
<div id="t5_30" class="t s1_30">these same people went on saying again and again that God created the world. Then </div>
<div id="t6_30" class="t s1_30">why did he create the world? So that you can renounce it? So that you can reject it? So </div>
<div id="t7_30" class="t s1_30">that you can condemn it and become great saints? </div>
<div id="t8_30" class="t s1_30">God created the world as an opportunity to grow. Growth needs many many </div>
<div id="t9_30" class="t s1_30">opportunities, challenges. </div>
<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">I have heard a story: </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">A farmer, an old farmer, mature, seasoned, one day was very very angry with God -- </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">and he was a great devotee. He said to God in his morning prayer, "I have to tell it as it </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">is -- enough is enough! You don't understand even the ABC of agriculture! When the </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">rains are needed there are no rains; when the rains are not needed you go on pouring </div>
<div id="tf_30" class="t s1_30">them. What nonsense is this? If you don't understand agriculture you can ask me -- I </div>
<div id="tg_30" class="t s1_30">have devoted my whole life to it. Give me one chance: the coming season, let ME decide </div>
<div id="th_30" class="t s1_30">and see what happens." </div>
<div id="ti_30" class="t s1_30">It is an ancient story. In those days people had such trust that they could talk directly to </div>
<div id="tj_30" class="t s1_30">God, and their trust was such that the answer was bound to happen. </div>
<div id="tk_30" class="t s1_30">God said, "Okay, this season you decide!" </div>
<div id="tl_30" class="t s1_30">So the farmer decided, and he was very happy because whenever he wanted sun there </div>
<div id="tm_30" class="t s1_30">was sun, whenever he wanted rain there was rain, whenever he wanted clouds there </div>
<div id="tn_30" class="t s1_30">were clouds. And he avoided all dangers, all the dangers that could become destructive </div>
<div id="to_30" class="t s1_30">to his crops; he simply rejected them -- no strong winds, no possibility of any </div>
<div id="tp_30" class="t s1_30">destruction to his crops. And his wheat started growing higher than anybody had ever </div>
<div id="tq_30" class="t s1_30">seen; it was going above man's height. And he was very happy. He thought, "Now I </div>
<div id="tr_30" class="t s1_30">will show him!" </div>
<div id="ts_30" class="t s1_30">And then the crop was cut and he was very puzzled. There was no wheat at all -- just </div>
<div id="tt_30" class="t s1_30">empty husks with no wheat in them. What happened? Such big plants -- plants big </div>
<div id="tu_30" class="t s1_30">enough to have given wheat four times bigger than ordinary wheat -- but there was no </div>
<div id="tv_30" class="t s1_30">wheat at all. </div>
<div id="tw_30" class="t s1_30">And suddenly he heard laughter from the clouds. God laughed and he said, "Now what </div>
<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">do you say?" </div>
<div id="ty_30" class="t s1_30">The farmer said, "I am puzzled, because there was no possibility of destruction and all </div>
<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">that was helpful was provided. And the plants were going so well, and the crop was so </div>
<div id="t10_30" class="t s1_30">green and so beautiful! What happened to my wheat?" </div>
<div id="t11_30" class="t s1_30">God said, "Because there was no danger -- you avoided all dangers -- it was impossible </div>
<div id="t12_30" class="t s1_30">for the wheat to grow. It needs challenges." </div>
