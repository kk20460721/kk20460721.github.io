<div id="t2_128" class="t s1_128">but not knowing, not awakening. When Gurdjieff was there it was totally </div>
<div id="t3_128" class="t s1_128">different -- a Master was there. He could have brought you out of your </div>
<div id="t4_128" class="t s1_128">imprisonment. </div>
<div id="t5_128" class="t s1_128">The first thing is to seek a Master who can help you. If it is impossible to find a </div>
<div id="t6_128" class="t s1_128">Master, then make a group and a group effort. Alone is the last possibility. These </div>
<div id="t7_128" class="t s1_128">are the three ways: alone you work, with a group you work, or with a Master </div>
<div id="t8_128" class="t s1_128">you work. The best is with a Master, the second best is with a group, the third is </div>
<div id="t9_128" class="t s1_128">alone. Even people who have attained to the ultimate alone have been working </div>
<div id="ta_128" class="t s1_128">through many lives with Masters and groups. So don't be deceived by the </div>
<div id="tb_128" class="t s1_128">appearance. </div>
<div id="tc_128" class="t s1_128">Even Krishnamurti goes on saying that alone you can attain. But why does he </div>
<div id="td_128" class="t s1_128">insist on this, that alone you can attain? This is because his method is an indirect </div>
<div id="te_128" class="t s1_128">method. He will not allow you to know that he is helping, and he will not say to </div>
<div id="tf_128" class="t s1_128">you, 'Surrender to me.' There is so much ego in the West, and he has been </div>
<div id="tg_128" class="t s1_128">working the whole time in the West. The ego is so much that he cannot say, </div>
<div id="th_128" class="t s1_128">'Surrender to me,' as Krishna said to Arjuna -- 'Leave everything and come and </div>
<div id="ti_128" class="t s1_128">surrender to me.' Arjuna was of a different world, the East, which knew how to </div>
<div id="tj_128" class="t s1_128">surrender, which knew the ugliness of the ego and the beauty of surrender. </div>
<div id="tk_128" class="t s1_128">Krishna could say this without any ego on his part. The assertion seems to be </div>
<div id="tl_128" class="t s1_128">very egoistic:'Come and surrender to me.' But Krishna could say it naturally, and </div>
<div id="tm_128" class="t s1_128">Arjuna never raised the question, 'Why do you say this? Why should I surrender </div>
<div id="tn_128" class="t s1_128">to you? Who are you?' In the East, surrender was accepted as a known path. </div>
<div id="to_128" class="t s1_128">Everybody knew, was raised in the very knowledge that finally, one has to </div>
<div id="tp_128" class="t s1_128">surrender to a Master. It was simple, it fitted. </div>
<div id="tq_128" class="t s1_128">Krishnamurti worked in the West. He himself was raised by Masters. In a very, </div>
<div id="tr_128" class="t s1_128">very esoteric way, he was helped by the Masters. Masters who were in the body </div>
<div id="ts_128" class="t s1_128">and Masters who were not in the body all helped him, they helped him to flower. </div>
<div id="tt_128" class="t s1_128">But then he worked in the West and he became aware, as anybody will become, </div>
<div id="tu_128" class="t s1_128">that the West is not ready to surrender. So he cannot say like Krishna, 'Come and </div>
<div id="tv_128" class="t s1_128">surrender to me.' For the Western ego, the best way is that you can attain on your </div>
<div id="tw_128" class="t s1_128">own. This is a device: no need to surrender to a Master. This is the base to attract </div>
<div id="tx_128" class="t s1_128">you: no need to surrender, no need to drop your ego, you be yourself. This is a </div>
<div id="ty_128" class="t s1_128">device and people got trapped in that device. They thought that there was no </div>
<div id="tz_128" class="t s1_128">need to surrender, that they could be themselves, that there was no need to learn </div>
<div id="t10_128" class="t s1_128">from the other, only one's own effort is needed. Continuously, for years they </div>
<div id="t11_128" class="t s1_128">have been going to Krishnamurti. For what? </div>
<div id="t12_128" class="t s1_128">-- to learn? If you can be alone then </div>
<div id="t13_128" class="t s1_128">why go to Krishnamurti? Once you have heard that he says, 'Alone you can </div>
<div id="t14_128" class="t s1_128">attain,' you should be finished with him. But you have not been finished with </div>
<div id="t15_128" class="t s1_128">him. In fact, unknowingly you have become a follower. Without your knowledge </div>
<div id="t16_128" class="t s1_128">you have been trapped. Deep down, the surrender has happened. He is saving </div>
<div id="t17_128" class="t s1_128">your surface ego to kill you deep down. His way is indirect. </div>
