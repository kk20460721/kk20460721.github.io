<div id="t2_231" class="t s1_231">....</div>
<div id="t3_231" class="t s1_231">He would be surrounded by the </div>
<div id="t4_231" class="t s1_231">whole country which believed that Gautam Buddha cannot be wrong. And in </div>
<div id="t5_231" class="t s1_231">actual fact, for six years after leaving his palace, Gautam Buddha did everything, </div>
<div id="t6_231" class="t s1_231">and all the teachers finally felt that he was a far greater soul than they themselves </div>
<div id="t7_231" class="t s1_231">were. And they said to him, "Forgive us. All that we knew, we have told you. </div>
<div id="t8_231" class="t s1_231">More than that is beyond our capacity. But we will suggest a greater teacher to </div>
<div id="t9_231" class="t s1_231">you." </div>
<div id="ta_231" class="t s1_231">For six years he went from one teacher to another teacher, and finally, the </div>
<div id="tb_231" class="t s1_231">greatest teacher of those days said to him, "You are wasting your time. No </div>
<div id="tc_231" class="t s1_231">teacher can help you. It is time enough that you should be on your own </div>
<div id="td_231" class="t s1_231">....</div>
<div id="te_231" class="t s1_231">Just </div>
<div id="tf_231" class="t s1_231">watch your mind. I don't have any other teaching for you." </div>
<div id="tg_231" class="t s1_231">Tired of those six years of continuous discipline </div>
<div id="th_231" class="t s1_231">....</div>
<div id="ti_231" class="t s1_231">It was a full moon night. He </div>
<div id="tj_231" class="t s1_231">had been was refused by the teacher and told, "Just watch your mind. There is no </div>
<div id="tk_231" class="t s1_231">discipline for you; those disciplines are for mediocre minds. They are </div>
<div id="tl_231" class="t s1_231">compromises, according to everybody's capacity -- a certain ritual to console him </div>
<div id="tm_231" class="t s1_231">that he is doing some work for enlightenment. Nothing will satisfy you unless </div>
<div id="tn_231" class="t s1_231">enlightenment happens." </div>
<div id="to_231" class="t s1_231">So he went away. A full moon night -- he had left the teacher just a few days </div>
<div id="tp_231" class="t s1_231">before. And he was sitting under the tree by the side of Niranjana in Bihar. In </div>
<div id="tq_231" class="t s1_231">India even trees are worshiped -- and I don't see anything wrong in it, because a </div>
<div id="tr_231" class="t s1_231">tree is also a living being and they are very nice people. They don't do any harm </div>
<div id="ts_231" class="t s1_231">to anybody. A woman had been a worshiper of that Bodhi tree. And she had told </div>
<div id="tt_231" class="t s1_231">the God of the tree that if she became pregnant -- because for years she had not </div>
<div id="tu_231" class="t s1_231">been getting pregnant -- if she became pregnant she would bring sweets, fruits </div>
<div id="tv_231" class="t s1_231">and flowers as a present to the god of the tree. </div>
<div id="tw_231" class="t s1_231">And on the full moon night, she came. She had become pregnant and when she </div>
<div id="tx_231" class="t s1_231">became absolutely certain and the physicians had said, "You are pregnant," she </div>
<div id="ty_231" class="t s1_231">brought delicious food, sweets, flowers. Her name was Sujata. It is a significant </div>
<div id="tz_231" class="t s1_231">name in the history of Gautam Buddha. </div>
<div id="t10_231" class="t s1_231">And he was hungry, because he had been fasting for months -- very hungry. But </div>
<div id="t11_231" class="t s1_231">he was a beautiful man, a prince, and because of the hunger he had become </div>
<div id="t12_231" class="t s1_231">almost pale. And in the full moon night, he looked as if he were the god of the </div>
<div id="t13_231" class="t s1_231">tree who had come out. </div>
<div id="t14_231" class="t s1_231">The woman could not believe it -- she was a villager, and she really thought that </div>
<div id="t15_231" class="t s1_231">the god of the tree had come out to receive her presents. She fell to his feet and </div>
<div id="t16_231" class="t s1_231">offered him all that she had brought. </div>
<div id="t17_231" class="t s1_231">This was the first time in those six years that he had taken a full meal. And that </div>
<div id="t18_231" class="t s1_231">too, in the night. It is not allowed for ascetics to eat at night, but now he was no </div>
<div id="t19_231" class="t s1_231">longer an ascetic. </div>
<div id="t1a_231" class="t s1_231">When the teacher had said, "All that you have to do is to watch," he dropped all </div>
<div id="t1b_231" class="t s1_231">disciplines, all asceticism. He had renounced his kingdom; now he renounced his </div>
<div id="t1c_231" class="t s1_231">renunciation too. For the first time he was perfectly relaxed. He ate well, and </div>
