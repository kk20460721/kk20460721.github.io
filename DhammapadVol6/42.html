<div id="ta_42" class="t s1_42">The whole humanity has been reduced to a state of neurosis; it is schizophrenia. </div>
<div id="tb_42" class="t s1_42">Everybody is split. And your so-called religious people are responsible for this great </div>

<div id="td_42" class="t s1_42">a divided, split personality. That's why it is so difficult to trust man: one moment he </div>

<div id="tp_42" class="t s1_42">In Russia there was a cult, a Christian cult, whose fundamental ritual was to cut off </div>

<div id="tr_42" class="t s1_42">breasts, the men would cut off their genital organs. And each year there was a </div>
<div id="ts_42" class="t s1_42">particular day when they would gather by the thousands, and it would be done in mass </div>

<div id="tw_42" class="t s1_42">Now there was a problem for the cult: how to increase their numbers. So they would </div>
