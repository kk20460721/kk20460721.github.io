<div id="t3_93" class="t s1_93">In the beginning it looks impossible. How? Because for centuries we have been </div>
<div id="t4_93" class="t s1_93">taught about one idea of power, and that is that of conflict, friction. We know </div>
<div id="t5_93" class="t s1_93">only one power and that is of fight. We know only one power, and that is of no, </div>

<div id="tk_93" class="t s1_93">You just try it sometimes. You have watched it -- the same phenomenon </div>

<div id="tn_93" class="t s1_93">going to the office, perfectly healthy and okay. The whole night he was in the </div>

<div id="t13_93" class="t s1_93">will be hospitalized. The children fall in accord. When they fall they are not </div>
<div id="t14_93" class="t s1_93">resisting, they are not going against the fall, they are not trying to protect </div>
<div id="t15_93" class="t s1_93">themselves. They don't go stiff. In fact, they fall in a very relaxed way. </div>
<div id="t16_93" class="t s1_93">Aikido, t'ai chi, or what Jesus calls meekness, what Buddha calls meekness, </div>
