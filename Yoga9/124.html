<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">unnecessary effort. </div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">But still I am not against anything. If you feel good, you have to decide it. I don't call it a </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">sin, and I am not saying that if you are homosexuals you are going to be thrown into hell. </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">All nonsense. If you are homosexual you will miss something, the feeling when yin meets </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">yang, the feeling where negative meets positive, night meets day. You will miss </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">something. Not that you will be thrown in hell, but you will miss something of heaven in </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">your life. </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">But still you have to decide. I am not giving you a commandment. </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">In fact the religious commandments have created the situation in which homosexuality </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">was born for the first time. This you will be surprised to know, that religions are the </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">cause of homosexuality in the world, because they insisted that men monks should live in </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">one monastery, women nuns should live in another monastery, and they should not meet. </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">Buddhists, Jains, Christians, all forced thousands of men into one herd and thousands of </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">women into another herd, and broke all the bridges between the two. They were the first </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">breeding grounds of homosexuality. They have created the situation because love is such </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">a deep desire that if you don't allow the natural outlet it becomes perverted. It finds ways </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">and means somehow to express itself. </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">In the army, people become homosexual easily. In boys' boarding houses and girls' </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">boarding houses people turn homosexual easily. If homosexuality is to disappear from the </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">world, then all segregation between man and woman should disappear. Hostels should be </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">for both the sexes together. And the army should not be only of men; women should be </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">allowed there. And clubs should not be only of boys; that is dangerous. And monasteries </div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s1_124">should be bisexual; otherwise homosexuality is natural. </div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">But it is a perversion, a disease.When I say "disease" I don't condemn it. I call it "disease" </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">with compassion. When somebody is suffering from tuberculosis, we don't condemn him. </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">We help him to get out of it. So when people come to me and confess that they are </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">homosexuals, I say don't be worried. I am here. I will bring you out of it. </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">Sex continues to be important to the very end of life -- if you are not alert, if you are not </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">transforming it. And to die sexual is an ugly death. One should come to a point when sex </div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">has been dropped far back. </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">Three very ancient members of the Army and Navy Club were discussing the subject of </div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">embarrassing moments over brandy and cigars. </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">The first two related incidents in their lives which they looked back on with shame; and </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">when it came to the turn of the third old codger, he told of how he had been caught out </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">peeping through the keyhole of the maid's bedroom. </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">"Ah yes," said one of the others with a chuckle. "We certainly got up to some pranks in </div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">our younger days." </div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">"Younger days, nothing!" said the third old boy. "This was last night." </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">But this is ugly. An old man should become again like a small child. Because when sex </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">disappears, all desires disappear. When sex disappears, the interest in the other </div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s1_124">disappears. Sex is the link with the society, with the world, with matter.When sex </div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s1_124">disappears, suddenly you start floating like a white cloud. You are uprooted; your roots </div>
<div id="t18_124" class="t s1_124">are no longer here in this world. </div>
