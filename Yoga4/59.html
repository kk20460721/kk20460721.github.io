<div id="t3_59" class="t s1_59">I have heard about a Jewish mystic, Josiah. He was dying and somebody asked, </div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">'Josiah, pray to Moses, and ask him to help you.' Josiah said, 'Forget about Moses. </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">Because when I am </div>

<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">that He will be waiting for.' </div>
