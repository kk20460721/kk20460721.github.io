<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">missed THE DHAMMAPADA; these beautiful sutras would have been missed. The </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">world would have been far poorer. The whole credit goes to those anonymous gods </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">who persuaded Buddha! </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">They pondered over the matter for hours; they found a way. They came back and they </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">said, "We agree with you, but only on one point we cannot agree. And that point is that </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">we understand that only one person will understand out of ten thousand, so you need </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">not bother about that one person; he will find himself sooner or later. It is only a </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">question of time, and time does not matter because existence is eternal. So what does it </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">matter, how does it matter, whether one achieves today and somebody else achieves </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? All those who have become awakened are </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">contemporaries; it does not make much difference at all." </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">That's why I say I am a contemporary to Buddha, a contemporary to Jesus, a </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">contemporary to Zarathustra, a contemporary to Lao Tzu. Once you know, you become </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">contemporary to all the knowers. All small time gaps simply disappear, they are so tiny. </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">Twenty-five hundred years make no difference at all. </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">That's why in the East we have not bothered much about time. Nobody knows when </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">Krishna was born. We could have also created a calendar in the name of Krishna -- </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">before Krishna, after Krishna -- we could have made a history. And Krishna certainly </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">preceded Jesus by at least three thousand years, so his calendar would have been five </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">thousand years old by now. But we have never bothered about it. Nobody knows when </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">the founder of Jainism, Adinatha, was born or when he died. He must have preceded </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">even Krishna by at least five thousand years. If we had a calendar then, his calendar </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">would by now have been at least ten thousand years old. I am saying "at least," because </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">Jainas say that he is far older. According to them he is almost ninety thousand years </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">ancient; it is possible. </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">But we have not created history, we have not written history, for the simple reason that </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">the people who are worth writing about go beyond time; for them time becomes </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">irrelevant. And the people who are not worth writing about, only they make much </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">noise in the world of time. Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">Ayatollah Khomeiniac, these people make much noise in the world of time. A Buddha, </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">a Krishna, a Jesus, a Zarathustra simply make no trace in time; they disappear without </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">leaving a trace, as if they are not part of history, or they are part of a totally different </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">kind of history which is nontemporal. </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">The gods argued with Buddha. They said, "We agree about that one person: he will find </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">it whether you tell him or not, he is so intelligent; if he can understand you </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">immediately, then he will find it by himself. And we also agree about the others, that </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">thousands will not understand you at all; they will, on the contrary, misunderstand </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">you. But they are already misunderstanding, what more misunderstanding can there </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">be? So you need not be worried about that point. They are already in confusion, you </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">cannot confuse them any more." </div>
