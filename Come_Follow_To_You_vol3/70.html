<div id="t2_70" class="t s1_70">MULTITUDE, BECAUSE THEY TOOK HIM FOR A PROPHET. </div>
<div id="t3_70" class="t s1_70">Now not only have they understood the parable, but the people who were </div>
<div id="t4_70" class="t s1_70">listening there, they have also understood it. It was so clear. Now it is difficult to </div>
<div id="t5_70" class="t s1_70">lay hands on Jesus. They had tried in every way to stop Jesus. They had wanted </div>
<div id="t6_70" class="t s1_70">to throw him into prison; they had wanted to kill him. They did whatsoever they </div>
<div id="t7_70" class="t s1_70">could, but they were always afraid of the multitude, of the crowd, of the </div>
<div id="t8_70" class="t s1_70">ordinary people -- for these are more sensitive; they can see things more clearly; </div>
<div id="t9_70" class="t s1_70">their eyes are not so clouded as the eyes of pundits and scholars, the knowers. </div>
<div id="ta_70" class="t s1_70">They had to wait for the right moment. They crucified him in the end, but they </div>
<div id="tb_70" class="t s1_70">had to wait for the right moment. And the right moment came, when they could </div>
<div id="tc_70" class="t s1_70">persuade the political power that this man was not talking religion, that this man </div>
<div id="td_70" class="t s1_70">was not a rebel -- this man was a revolutionary. They persuaded the political </div>
<div id="te_70" class="t s1_70">powers: "This man is not talking about the kingdom of God -- that is just a </div>
<div id="tf_70" class="t s1_70">strategy. This man is talking about this kingdom on the earth. This man is not </div>
<div id="tg_70" class="t s1_70">trying to lead people towards God; this man is trying to possess power; the </div>
<div id="th_70" class="t s1_70">kingdom of this earth, for himself He is against the government." </div>
<div id="ti_70" class="t s1_70">When they could persuade the government, only then</div>
<div id="tj_70" class="t s1_70">....</div>
<div id="tk_70" class="t s1_70">And remember, there is </div>
<div id="tl_70" class="t s1_70">always a conspiracy between the priests and the political leaders. They have </div>
<div id="tm_70" class="t s1_70">always been in conspiracy; they help each other. Whenever the politician needs </div>
<div id="tn_70" class="t s1_70">his position sanctified by religion, the priest comes to help. He says, "The king is </div>
<div id="to_70" class="t s1_70">no ordinary human being. He is an incarnation of God." He says, "He is made </div>
<div id="tp_70" class="t s1_70">king by God himself. His authority is not in himself but in God; he's just a </div>
<div id="tq_70" class="t s1_70">representative of God on earth." </div>
<div id="tr_70" class="t s1_70">That's how the priests help the king, the political power, and give him an aura of </div>
<div id="ts_70" class="t s1_70">religion and divineness; that's how kings have existed up to now. </div>
<div id="tt_70" class="t s1_70">And so the priest is in difficulty from the mystics, and both the king and the </div>
<div id="tu_70" class="t s1_70">priest are in difficulty from the mystics, because the mystic is a rebel. A mystic is </div>
<div id="tv_70" class="t s1_70">a rebellion. His very being is so free that he would like to liberate everybody else. </div>
<div id="tw_70" class="t s1_70">His message is liberation, freedom -- total, absolute freedom. The king is afraid; </div>
<div id="tx_70" class="t s1_70">the priests help. The priest is afraid; the king helps. </div>
<div id="ty_70" class="t s1_70">The priests and the political power both joined together to kill this innocent man </div>
<div id="tz_70" class="t s1_70">who had no power at all; or, his power was not of this world -- his power was </div>
<div id="t10_70" class="t s1_70">that of a meek and humble man; his power was that of a realized man. The </div>
<div id="t11_70" class="t s1_70">power is not violent. His power is that of love, what Lao Tzu calls 'the man of </div>
<div id="t12_70" class="t s1_70">tao'. He is powerful, because he is powerless. He is supremely high, because he </div>
<div id="t13_70" class="t s1_70">lives at the lowest point. He's at the peak, because he lives in the darkest valley. </div>
<div id="t14_70" class="t s1_70">He's great, because hc does not claim greatness. The power of the meek, the </div>
<div id="t15_70" class="t s1_70">power of the humble, the power of the egoless, the power of one who is not... </div>
<div id="t16_70" class="t s1_70">then the power of God enters. Then he becomes the vehicle for the whole. </div>
<div id="t17_70" class="t s1_70">The last thing: be alert, because in each of you these three possibilities are all </div>
<div id="t18_70" class="t s1_70">hidden. You can be a priest if you say a false yes and you can also be a scholar </div>
