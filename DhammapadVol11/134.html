<div id="t3_134" class="t s1_134">buttons are in different places. </div>
<div id="t4_134" class="t s1_134">A Polack was driving his Volkswagen, when suddenly it stopped for some reason. He </div>

<div id="t7_134" class="t s1_134">Just then another Polack stopped by his side. He said, "Is there some trouble?" </div>

<div id="td_134" class="t s1_134">same engine with the same buttons, maybe a little bit different here and there, just a </div>
<div id="te_134" class="t s1_134">little change. Anybody can find... just a little groping and you can find anybody else's </div>

<div id="tl_134" class="t s1_134">EVIL FOR EVIL. He understands humanity so deeply. By understanding himself he has </div>
