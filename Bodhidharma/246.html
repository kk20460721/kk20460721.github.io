<div id="t1_246" class="t s1_246">WORLD IS CHARITY. By renouncing and abandoning the world that is </div>
<div id="t2_246" class="t s1_246">available to the eyes ...the only way is to be blind! Otherwise, how can you </div>
<div id="t3_246" class="t s1_246">abandon it? You can go to the mountains but the visual world will be there. You </div>
<div id="t4_246" class="t s1_246">can go in a dark cave but darkness is also visual. You see it. And in fact, even </div>
<div id="t5_246" class="t s1_246">blindness will not help unless you are born blind because a man who is born </div>
<div id="t6_246" class="t s1_246">blind cannot even see dreams. He has no idea of anything. </div>
<div id="t7_246" class="t s1_246">You may never have thought about it. Do you think a blind man can see a </div>
<div id="t8_246" class="t s1_246">railway train in his dream, or a starry night in his dream, or a beautiful woman </div>
<div id="t9_246" class="t s1_246">in his dream, or a roseflower in his dream? Impossible, because he has never </div>
<div id="ta_246" class="t s1_246">seen these things. Dreams are only reflections. What you have seen in actual life, </div>
<div id="tb_246" class="t s1_246">dreams can reflect. </div>
<div id="tc_246" class="t s1_246">The most surprising thing is that almost everybody thinks that a blind man lives </div>
<div id="td_246" class="t s1_246">in darkness. And that is wrong, because darkness is also a visual phenomenon, </div>
<div id="te_246" class="t s1_246">you have to see it. The blind man has no eyes. He cannot even see darkness; light </div>
<div id="tf_246" class="t s1_246">is far away. If he can see darkness, then you cannot prevent him from seeing </div>
<div id="tg_246" class="t s1_246">light. And if he can see things in dreams, he is not blind. The born blind see </div>
<div id="th_246" class="t s1_246">nothing, just as the born deaf hear nothing. </div>
<div id="ti_246" class="t s1_246">But what can you do? You have eyes. How can you abandon the visual world? </div>
<div id="tj_246" class="t s1_246">There was in India a poet, Surdas, who has been worshiped by Hindus as a great </div>
<div id="tk_246" class="t s1_246">saint. Surdas saw a beautiful woman -- he had gone to beg, not aware of who </div>
<div id="tl_246" class="t s1_246">was inside the house. He knocked on the door and a beautiful woman opened </div>
<div id="tm_246" class="t s1_246">the door. And suddenly a desire, a fancy for her arose in his being. It was </div>
<div id="tn_246" class="t s1_246">natural; it was not wrong. If you can enjoy a beautiful flower, why can't you </div>
<div id="to_246" class="t s1_246">enjoy a beautiful face? But religions are very much against all pleasures. It seems </div>
<div id="tp_246" class="t s1_246">all religions have been founded by masochists. Torture yourself! The more you </div>
<div id="tq_246" class="t s1_246">torture yourself, the more you become spiritual. </div>
<div id="tr_246" class="t s1_246">Surdas became very much guilty -- and he had done nothing; just the face was so </div>
<div id="ts_246" class="t s1_246">beautiful that it was natural a great appreciation arose in him. But it was against </div>
<div id="tt_246" class="t s1_246">the religious precepts. He destroyed both his eyes and he became blind. And </div>
<div id="tu_246" class="t s1_246">because of this blindness, he has been worshiped for centuries as a great saint. </div>
<div id="tv_246" class="t s1_246">But do you think by destroying his eyes, he would have stopped dreaming? Just </div>
<div id="tw_246" class="t s1_246">the opposite -- then he would dream more and more of that beautiful face. The </div>
<div id="tx_246" class="t s1_246">face that was beautiful would become more beautiful, more fancy, in his dreams. </div>
<div id="ty_246" class="t s1_246">And this is the meaning of charity? </div>
<div id="tz_246" class="t s1_246">Charity simply means an unconditional sharing. It has nothing to do with the </div>
<div id="t10_246" class="t s1_246">eyes and nothing to do with the visual world and its abandonment. It simply </div>
<div id="t11_246" class="t s1_246">means you have something; you should enjoy to share it. Don't be a miser. Don't </div>
<div id="t12_246" class="t s1_246">hold on to it because this whole life is going to end one day and you will not be </div>
<div id="t13_246" class="t s1_246">able to take anything with you. So while you are alive, why not share as much as </div>
<div id="t14_246" class="t s1_246">you can? Things which can be taken away any moment ...it is better that you </div>
<div id="t15_246" class="t s1_246">share them. And it is a great joy to share. The man who learns the art of sharing </div>
<div id="t16_246" class="t s1_246">is the richest man in the world. He may be poor, but his inner being has a quality </div>
<div id="t17_246" class="t s1_246">of richness that even emperors may feel jealous of. </div>
