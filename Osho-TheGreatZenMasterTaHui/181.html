<div id="t3_181" class="t s1_181">He calls this kind of question -- whether a dog has buddha-nature or not -- A COMMON</div>
<div id="t4_181" class="t s1_181">DISEASE OF BEGINNERS ENTERING THE PATH. It is natural human curiosity. But at</div>
<div id="t5_181" class="t s1_181">least somebody has entered the path. Such questions don't mean anything to those who have</div>
<div id="t6_181" class="t s1_181">not entered the path at all. It is not a disease; it is simply a curiosity.</div>
<div id="t7_181" class="t s1_181">If all living beings are intrinsically as capable of awakening as human, it simply makes</div>
<div id="t8_181" class="t s1_181">existence truly communist. As far as I am concerned, I think communism is right only when it</div>
<div id="t9_181" class="t s1_181">is concerned with the ultimate nature of beings. Only in that ultimate stage is there equality.</div>
<div id="ta_181" class="t s1_181">Before that, communism is a utopia and is never going to be fulfilled.</div>
<div id="tb_181" class="t s1_181">Only two buddhas are equal, but ignorant people cannot be equal. Ignorant people are</div>
<div id="tc_181" class="t s1_181">psychologically unequal; hence the whole idea of Karl Marx and his followers that man is</div>
<div id="td_181" class="t s1_181">equal is psychologically wrong.</div>
<div id="te_181" class="t s1_181">No two men are equal. They have all the differences that you can conceive, and to force</div>
<div id="tf_181" class="t s1_181">them into equality you will have to destroy democracy, you will have to destroy freedom, you</div>

<div id="th_181" class="t s1_181">their dignity of being human, their very pride. It is a very strange kind of equality. Everybody</div>
<div id="ti_181" class="t s1_181">is bulldozed, and everybody becomes equal!</div>
<div id="tj_181" class="t s1_181">There was one king in Greece who was a little cuckoo. He had made a beautiful golden</div>
<div id="tk_181" class="t s1_181">bed in a special guesthouse, a great palace. Only a few guests ever stayed in his guesthouse,</div>
<div id="tl_181" class="t s1_181">and they never came out alive because the trouble with the king was that the guest had to fit</div>
<div id="tm_181" class="t s1_181">with the bed. If he was a little long, then his legs or his head had to be cut to size. Or if he was</div>
<div id="tn_181" class="t s1_181">a little short, then traction -- he had to be pulled from both ends; the king had four wrestlers</div>
<div id="to_181" class="t s1_181">practicing traction. But anyway he was going to be killed. In traction his head would be pulled</div>
<div id="tp_181" class="t s1_181">out, because they were pulling his head to make him the size of the bed, or his legs may be</div>
<div id="tq_181" class="t s1_181">pulled out.</div>

<div id="ts_181" class="t s1_181">made for them, not that they are made for man. His bed was not made for man, every guest</div>
<div id="tt_181" class="t s1_181">has to fit with the bed. As the rumor reached to other friends, other kings, nobody accepted his</div>
<div id="tu_181" class="t s1_181">invitation. He was continuously inviting guests, but nobody was ready to come because</div>
<div id="tv_181" class="t s1_181">anybody who ever went never came back again: what happened to the guests? In fact the king</div>
<div id="tw_181" class="t s1_181">was practicing a sort of communism, making everybody of equal size. And that's what has</div>
<div id="tx_181" class="t s1_181">happened in the Soviet Union for seventy years.</div>
<div id="ty_181" class="t s1_181">Just seventy years ago, before the revolution, the Soviet Union was one of the giant</div>
<div id="tz_181" class="t s1_181">countries; it had given birth to a great line of geniuses. In seventy years they have not been</div>
<div id="t10_181" class="t s1_181">able to create a single genius of the quality of Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov,</div>
<div id="t11_181" class="t s1_181">Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, not a single man in seventy years. All these five men existed</div>
<div id="t12_181" class="t s1_181">before the revolution, and Maxim Gorky even remained alive after the revolution for a few</div>
<div id="t13_181" class="t s1_181">years.</div>

<div id="t17_181" class="t s1_181">Russians. Still those five from the rest of the world will not be really comparable to the</div>
<div id="t18_181" class="t s1_181">greatness of the Russian novelists. What happened?</div>
<div id="t19_181" class="t s1_181">Chapter 14 - Clarity</div>
