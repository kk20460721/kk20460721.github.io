<div id="t2_99" class="t s2_99">dark valley, in your unconsciousness. If I talk about my experience, absolutely inconsiderate of you,</div>
<div id="t3_99" class="t s2_99">I am right, but I am not useful to you.</div>
<div id="t4_99" class="t s2_99">An enlightened person is never wrong, but he can be useful or he can be useless.</div>
<div id="t5_99" class="t s2_99">J. Krishnamurti is useless! He is perfectly right; about that there is no question, because I know the</div>
<div id="t6_99" class="t s2_99">peak and what he is saying is certainly true – from the vision of the peak. Those who have arrived,</div>
<div id="t7_99" class="t s2_99">for them the journey becomes almost a dream phenomenon. For those who have not arrived the</div>
<div id="t8_99" class="t s2_99">journey is real, the goal is just a dream. They are living in two different worlds. When you are talking</div>
<div id="t9_99" class="t s2_99">to a madman you have to consider him; if you don’t consider him you cannot help him.</div>
<div id="ta_99" class="t s2_99">Once a madman was brought to me.</div>
<div id="tb_99" class="t s2_99">He had this crazy idea that one afternoon when he was</div>
<div id="tc_99" class="t s2_99">sleeping, a ﬂy has entered his mouth. And because he used to sleep with open mouth, nobody can</div>
<div id="td_99" class="t s2_99">deny the possibility. And since then he was very much disturbed because the ﬂy was roaming inside</div>
<div id="te_99" class="t s2_99">him, jumping inside him, moving in his belly, going to his bladder, circulating in his bloodstream,</div>
<div id="tf_99" class="t s2_99">sometimes in his head, sometimes in his feet. And of course he could not do anything because he</div>
<div id="tg_99" class="t s2_99">was continuously occupied, obsessed with the ﬂy.</div>
<div id="th_99" class="t s2_99">He was taken to the psychoanalysts and they said, ”This is just in your mind – there is no ﬂy! And</div>
<div id="ti_99" class="t s2_99">no ﬂy can move in your bloodstream, there is no possibility. Even if a ﬂy has entered it must have</div>
<div id="tj_99" class="t s2_99">died! And now six months have passed; it cannot be alive inside you.”</div>
<div id="tk_99" class="t s2_99">He listened, but he could not believe it because his experience was far more solid. He was taken</div>
<div id="tl_99" class="t s2_99">to the doctors and everybody examined him and they did everything, but ﬁnally they will say, ”It is</div>
<div id="tm_99" class="t s2_99">just a mental thing. You are imagining.” He will listen what they were saying, but he could not trust</div>
<div id="tn_99" class="t s2_99">because his experience was far more certain than their words.</div>
<div id="to_99" class="t s2_99">His family brought him to me as a last resort. The man was looking very tired because he was being</div>
<div id="tp_99" class="t s2_99">taken to one person, then to another, then all kinds of physicians – allopaths and homeopaths and</div>
<div id="tq_99" class="t s2_99">naturopaths – and he was really tired. In the ﬁrst place the ﬂy was tiring him, and now all these</div>
<div id="tr_99" class="t s2_99">”pathies”, medicines. And everybody was insulting him – that was his feeling, that they were saying</div>
<div id="ts_99" class="t s2_99">that he was just imagining. Is he a fool or he is mad, that he will imagine such a thing? They were</div>
<div id="tt_99" class="t s2_99">all humiliating him – that was his feeling.</div>
<div id="tu_99" class="t s2_99">I looked at the man and I said, ”It is so clear that the ﬂy is inside!”</div>
<div id="tv_99" class="t s2_99">For a moment he was puzzled. He could not believe me, because nobody has said that to him –</div>
<div id="tw_99" class="t s2_99">because nobody has considered him. And they ALL were right and I was wrong – there was no ﬂy,</div>
<div id="tx_99" class="t s2_99">but the madman has to be considered.</div>
<div id="ty_99" class="t s2_99">And I said, ”All those fools are just wasting your time; you should have come ﬁrst here. It is such a</div>
<div id="tz_99" class="t s2_99">simple thing to bring the ﬂy out; there is no need to bother. Medicines won’t help – you are not ill.</div>
<div id="t10_99" class="t s2_99">Psycholanalysis will not help – you are not crazy.”</div>
<div id="t11_99" class="t s2_99">And immediately he was a changed man! He looked at his wife and said, ”Now what do you say?</div>
<div id="t12_99" class="t s2_99">This is the right man,” he said, ”who really knows. And all those fools were trying to convince me</div>
<div id="t13_99" class="t s2_99">that there is no ﬂy. It is there!”</div>
<div id="t14_99" class="t s2_99">I Am That</div>
<div id="t15_99" class="t s2_99">99</div>
<div id="t16_99" class="t s3_99">Osho</div>
