<div id="t2_68" class="t s1_68">necessary. A small child asks the mother, "Can I go outside and play?" and </div>
<div id="t3_68" class="t s1_68">immediately she says, "No." He was not demanding anything -- just a little </div>
<div id="t4_68" class="t s1_68">sunlight; just with the flowers a little bit, running after the butterflies. He was not </div>
<div id="t5_68" class="t s1_68">asking much, and it costs nothing. The sun is available, free; the butterflies are </div>
<div id="t6_68" class="t s1_68">waiting, because if nobody chases them they don't feel good; and the flowers are </div>
<div id="t7_68" class="t s1_68">there -- somebody should come and smell them; they would like to share their </div>
<div id="t8_68" class="t s1_68">happiness with somebody. </div>
<div id="t9_68" class="t s1_68">And the child asks, "Can I go outside?" And the mother says, "No." And the </div>
<div id="ta_68" class="t s1_68">mother has not even pondered over it, not even for a single moment. No comes </div>
<div id="tb_68" class="t s1_68">easy, as if it is always there, ready. You just say anything and she says no. And </div>
<div id="tc_68" class="t s1_68">she knows well that the child will go out, because he will insist again and again; </div>
<div id="td_68" class="t s1_68">two, three times he will ask, and the fourth time she will say, "Yes, you go out. </div>
<div id="te_68" class="t s1_68">Don't bother me so much." And she knows, and the child knows, but still the no </div>
<div id="tf_68" class="t s1_68">comes. The yes doesn't seem easy. </div>
<div id="tg_68" class="t s1_68">The servant asks for his pay. You can give him it right now but you say, </div>

<div id="tm_68" class="t s1_68">who will say no? </div>
<div id="tn_68" class="t s1_68">Look at the policeman standing on the crossroads, no written on his face. Look at </div>
<div id="to_68" class="t s1_68">people's faces; this is the way to judge who is religious and who is not. If the face </div>
<div id="tp_68" class="t s1_68">says no the man is irreligious, though he may be in the temple praying. If the </div>

<div id="ts_68" class="t s1_68">Yes has to be earned; one has to grow towards it. It's the most beautiful </div>

<div id="tx_68" class="t s1_68">positive attitude, and that's how you have been living. </div>
<div id="ty_68" class="t s1_68">I have heard a story about a Hassid mystic. His name is Rabbi Mossey. He was </div>
<div id="tz_68" class="t s1_68">very poor in the eyes of others. Himself, he was an emperor, tremendously rich, </div>
<div id="t10_68" class="t s1_68">infinitely rich, but his richness was of the within. </div>
<div id="t11_68" class="t s1_68">A beggar came one day as he was sitting with his disciples, and he gave him his </div>
<div id="t12_68" class="t s1_68">last coin. One disciple objected. And the objection was also meaningful, because </div>
<div id="t13_68" class="t s1_68">the man to whom he gave the coin was a drunkard, who would immediately go </div>
<div id="t14_68" class="t s1_68">to the pub. So the disciple said two things: "First, you don't have enough to eat </div>
