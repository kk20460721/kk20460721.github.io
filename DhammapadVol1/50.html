<div id="t2_50" class="t s1_50">treasure is such that it can disappear any moment, how can you avoid the feeling of </div>
<div id="t3_50" class="t s1_50">immense urgency? You will have to shout from the tops of the houses. </div>
<div id="t4_50" class="t s1_50">And the response that you will get is absolutely certain and fixed. The more you would </div>
<div id="t5_50" class="t s1_50">like people to come to me, the more they will escape -- from you, from the very idea of </div>
<div id="t6_50" class="t s1_50">coming to me. And the only way to escape is to ridicule you, to laugh at you, to call you </div>
<div id="t7_50" class="t s1_50">mad. That is their way of defending themselves. If they listen to you understandingly, if </div>
<div id="t8_50" class="t s1_50">they allow you to overwhelm their being, to overflow into their being, to flood their </div>
<div id="t9_50" class="t s1_50">being, then they will also find themselves in the same grip. And it will be very difficult </div>
<div id="ta_50" class="t s1_50">for them to avoid. </div>
<div id="tb_50" class="t s1_50">Hence, from the very beginning they will ridicule you, criticize you, oppose you, laugh </div>
<div id="tc_50" class="t s1_50">at you. They will do everything possible to create the feeling in you that you are wrong. </div>
<div id="td_50" class="t s1_50">But they failed. They could not create that feeling in you. The more they ridiculed you, </div>
<div id="te_50" class="t s1_50">the more they laughed, the more they criticized, the more you tried to convince them. </div>
<div id="tf_50" class="t s1_50">And you have been objectively successful -- you have convinced thousands of people. </div>
<div id="tg_50" class="t s1_50">Since your going to Holland, many many Dutch people have arrived, and more are </div>
<div id="th_50" class="t s1_50">arriving, and more will go on arriving. You have created a great stir. You have touched </div>
<div id="ti_50" class="t s1_50">many people's hearts. And it has been a great experience for your inner growth too. </div>
<div id="tj_50" class="t s1_50">The impact that you created has not got into your head yet; it has not made you more of </div>
<div id="tk_50" class="t s1_50">an egoist. In fact, it has made you more humble. It may not have been exactly wu-wei, </div>
<div id="tl_50" class="t s1_50">but it was very close. And I was not expecting it to be absolutely wu-wei, but it has been </div>
<div id="tm_50" class="t s1_50">more than I was expecting. </div>
<div id="tn_50" class="t s1_50">I was a little bit afraid, Amrito, that you might go mad. The urgency was such, your </div>
<div id="to_50" class="t s1_50">ecstasy was such, you were so passionately in love with me, that I was afraid deep </div>
<div id="tp_50" class="t s1_50">down. I was sending you with all kinds of apprehensions. But you survived the test. </div>
<div id="tq_50" class="t s1_50">You have come back. The turmoil that was created around you because of your talking </div>
<div id="tr_50" class="t s1_50">about me -- in the newspapers, on the radio, the TV -- the way you talked, it gave the </div>
<div id="ts_50" class="t s1_50">sense of your immense love, it gave the sense that you have found the home. </div>
<div id="tt_50" class="t s1_50">Many have been convinced. And many who have not been convinced have also started </div>
<div id="tu_50" class="t s1_50">thinking about it. And even those who have ridiculed you and have opposed you are </div>
<div id="tv_50" class="t s1_50">impressed; otherwise who cares? Why should you oppose somebody if you are not </div>
<div id="tw_50" class="t s1_50">impressed? Why should you ridicule and laugh if you are simply alert that he is mad? </div>
<div id="tx_50" class="t s1_50">Nobody laughs at a madman, nobody ridicules a madman. It is enough to know that he </div>
<div id="ty_50" class="t s1_50">is mad and everything is finished! </div>
<div id="tz_50" class="t s1_50">You have created a chain which will go on. And I would like many of my sannyasins to </div>
<div id="t10_50" class="t s1_50">be so excited, to feel the urgency, to go to their countries and spread the word. And you </div>
<div id="t11_50" class="t s1_50">will have to shout from the tops of the houses. </div>
<div id="t12_50" class="t s1_50">And whenever you are in love you look mad -- you are mad. Love is madness...but far </div>
<div id="t13_50" class="t s1_50">higher than the so-called, mediocre, mundane sanity. And love is blindness, but a </div>
<div id="t14_50" class="t s1_50">blindness that is capable of seeing the invisible. </div>
<div id="t15_50" class="t s1_50">Love is not part of the ordinary world that we have created. We have expelled love </div>
<div id="t16_50" class="t s1_50">from it. So whenever you are in love -- and to be in love with a master, to be in love </div>
