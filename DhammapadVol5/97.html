<div id="t5_97" class="t s1_97">coming closer to me. It takes time, but the most sensitive people are bound to become </div>
<div id="t6_97" class="t s1_97">part of my buddhafield. </div>
<div id="t7_97" class="t s1_97">And Indians suffer from an inferiority complex because for one thousand years they </div>
<div id="t8_97" class="t s1_97">have been slaves. </div>
<div id="t9_97" class="t s1_97">Rabindranath was never praised in India -- condemned, criticized as much as possible </div>
<div id="ta_97" class="t s1_97">because he was a very life-affirmative person. He even had the courage to criticize </div>
<div id="tb_97" class="t s1_97">Buddha in his own way. He was against the whole negative tradition of India. </div>
<div id="tc_97" class="t s1_97">In one of his poems he says: </div>
<div id="td_97" class="t s1_97">After twelve years Buddha comes back home -- he has become enlightened. He has </div>
<div id="te_97" class="t s1_97">thousands of followers; naturally he remembers his wife, his child, his old father, and </div>
<div id="tf_97" class="t s1_97">he wants to help them. He wants to share what he has attained, so he comes back to his </div>

<div id="th_97" class="t s1_97">very angry. </div>
<div id="ti_97" class="t s1_97">For twelve years she has been accumulating anger, but an Indian wife, even if she is </div>
<div id="tj_97" class="t s1_97">angry, cannot show her anger to her husband, at least not in those days. But in a very </div>
<div id="tk_97" class="t s1_97">vicarious way... she asks one question of Buddha. It is not an historical thing, it is a </div>
<div id="tl_97" class="t s1_97">poem by Rabindranath Tagore, his own invention but it shows his attitude and </div>
<div id="tm_97" class="t s1_97">approach. </div>
<div id="tn_97" class="t s1_97">Yashodhara asks Buddha, "Just one question I have to ask you: for twelve years I have </div>

<div id="tp_97" class="t s1_97">become enlightened living in the world, in the house with me? Just one question I want </div>

<div id="ts_97" class="t s1_97">more than the search for truth?" </div>
<div id="tt_97" class="t s1_97">And Rabindranath says Buddha bows down his head and stands silently, says nothing. </div>
<div id="tu_97" class="t s1_97">But that says everything -- now Buddha knows it could have happened in the house </div>
<div id="tv_97" class="t s1_97">too. There was no need to desert the wife and the child and the old father and the </div>

<div id="tx_97" class="t s1_97">enlightenment has nothing to do with the mountains and the forests; it can happen </div>
<div id="ty_97" class="t s1_97">anywhere. </div>
<div id="tz_97" class="t s1_97">Rabindranath in another of his poems says, "I don't want NOT to be born again. I pray </div>
