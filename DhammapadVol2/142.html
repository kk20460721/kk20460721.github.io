<div id="t2_142" class="t s1_142">those six years. And if you read Buddhist scriptures you will find that it seems as if it is </div>
<div id="t3_142" class="t s1_142">because of those six years of austerities that he attained enlightenment. It is not so. It is </div>
<div id="t4_142" class="t s1_142">not by those six years of austerities that he attained enlightenment; he attained </div>
<div id="t5_142" class="t s1_142">enlightenment the day he dropped all those austerities. It was by DROPPING them that </div>
<div id="t6_142" class="t s1_142">he attained enlightenment, not by or through them. </div>
<div id="t7_142" class="t s1_142">But if you read the scriptures, particularly those written in India, you will be given a </div>
<div id="t8_142" class="t s1_142">totally false impression. They make it appear as if Buddha has not contributed anything </div>

<div id="td_142" class="t s1_142">have made Buddha look like. That is a falsification. Buddha does not represent the old. </div>

<div id="ti_142" class="t s1_142">Although Buddha dropped asceticism, he did not talk much against it; he could not, </div>
<div id="tj_142" class="t s1_142">because he had to communicate with people who were full of the ancient lore and the </div>
