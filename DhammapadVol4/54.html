<div id="t1_54" class="t s1_54">one who cannot hear, who is deaf; talking to a person who is suffering from fever and </div>
<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">whose taste is lost about "sweet." The taste of sweetness is meaningless; he has lost all </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">taste. But a little bit is possible because he used to taste before; he can remember. </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">But you cannot even remember when you used to taste God; you have completely </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">forgotten the taste. Maybe in your mother's womb there was some experience similar -- </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">maybe not exactly the same, but similar. </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">I cannot tell you what it feels like, but I can show you the way. I can push you into the </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">abyss... that is the only possibility. You can also taste it, and then you will become as </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">dumb as I am, you will become as dumb as all the buddhas have been. </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">Just try to see the point of translating. </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">Rabindranath was given the Nobel Prize for his book GITANJALI. He had written it in </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">his own mother tongue, Bengali. It has a different beauty in Bengali. Bengali has a </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">music to it; it is one of the most beautiful languages in the world. It has a certain flavor </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">of the heart. Its very constitution is poetic, it is MADE of poetry, the language itself. </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">Hence GITANJALI in its original form is an altogether different experience. </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">Rabindranath himself translated it into English, but he felt very miserable. For years he </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">tried. He knew English perfectly well, but he could see the difference -- the difference </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">was vast. While the original was somewhere on Everest, the translation was just on the </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">plains; the difference was vast. In translation something was lost, something which was </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">really precious. </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">He asked a very famous Englishman, C.F. Andrews, to help him. Andrews was </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">enchanted with the beauty of the book, because he knew nothing of the original. That's </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">why you are enchanted with the words of buddhas, because you don't know anything </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">of the original. If you knew anything of the original then the words of the buddhas </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">would look just rubbish compared to the original; compared to those virgin peaks of the </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">Himalayas the words will look mundane, of the marketplace. They ARE of the </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">marketplace, they are meant for the marketplace. </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">Andrews was enchanted. Rabindranath said, "But I have shown you the book to help </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">me." </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">Andrews suggested only four corrections; they were grammatical. Each language has its </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">own grammar. He said, "These four words you change; they are a little bit </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">grammatically wrong." </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">Rabindranath immediately changed those words. Then he went to England. In a poets' </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">gathering -- a great English poet, Yeats, had called a gathering of the poets, the critics, </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">and the people who love poetry, to listen to Rabindranath's GITANJALI -- </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">Rabindranath read the poetry. They were all fascinated; it was something superb, </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">something rarely known in the West, because it has the same quality as the Upanishads. </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">If you have read Kahlil Gibran... it has the same quality. </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">But Yeats stood up and said, "Everything is perfectly right except that in four places </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">something is wrong." </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">Those were exactly the four words that were suggested by C.F. Andrews. </div>
