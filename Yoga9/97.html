<div id="t1_97" class="t s1_97">One of the arguments is this, "I cannot believe that hell can be eternal because </div>
<div id="t2_97" class="t s1_97">whatsoever the sins, they are limited. You cannot do unlimited sins. So for limited sins </div>
<div id="t3_97" class="t s1_97">unlimited punishment -- it is unjust." The argument is simple. Nobody can argue against </div>
<div id="t4_97" class="t s1_97">Bertrand Russell; he is saying a simple fact. He himself says, "If I am punished for all the </div>
<div id="t5_97" class="t s1_97">sins that I have committed in my whole life, then not more than four years' imprisonment. </div>
<div id="t6_97" class="t s1_97">And even if those sins are included that I have not committed but only thought, then at </div>
<div id="t7_97" class="t s1_97">the most eight years, or a little margin more, ten years. But infinite, eternal hell?" Then </div>
<div id="t8_97" class="t s1_97">God seems to be too revengeful, does not look divine, does not look godly, looks like a </div>
<div id="t9_97" class="t s1_97">very horrible, devilish force. </div>
<div id="ta_97" class="t s1_97">Because you loved a woman who was not your wife, now you will suffer -- eternally. </div>
<div id="tb_97" class="t s1_97">This is too much. You have not committed such a great sin. It is human to fall in love, </div>
<div id="tc_97" class="t s1_97">and when one falls in love it is difficult to decide whether or not to fall in love with a </div>
<div id="td_97" class="t s1_97">woman who is not anybody else's wife. Hmm ?... love is almost blind. It possesses you. </div>
<div id="te_97" class="t s1_97">Yes, Bertrand Russell seems to be right, his argument seems to be valid; but I say the </div>
<div id="tf_97" class="t s1_97">argument is not valid. He has missed the whole point. And no Christian theologian has </div>
<div id="tg_97" class="t s1_97">answered him on that point yet. They cannot answer because they have also forgotten. </div>
<div id="th_97" class="t s1_97">They go on talking about theories, but they have forgotten realities. When Jesus says hell </div>
<div id="ti_97" class="t s1_97">is eternal, he means psychological time, not chronological time. Yes, if he means </div>
<div id="tj_97" class="t s1_97">chronological time, then it is absolutely absurd, to throw a man in eternal hell. He means </div>
<div id="tk_97" class="t s1_97">psychological time, He means that one moment in hell will look like eternity. It will slow </div>
<div id="tl_97" class="t s1_97">down so much because you will be in such anguish and pain that even a single moment </div>
<div id="tm_97" class="t s1_97">will look like eternity. You will feel it is not going to end anytime, it is not going to end. </div>
<div id="tn_97" class="t s1_97">You will feel it continues, continues, continues. </div>
<div id="to_97" class="t s1_97">It does not say anything about time; it says something about your feeling when you are in </div>
<div id="tp_97" class="t s1_97">deep pain, anguish. And of course hell is the ultimate in pain. And Jesus is perfectly right, </div>
<div id="tq_97" class="t s1_97">Bertrand Russell wrong, but Bertrand Russell misunderstood it because Jesus has not said </div>
<div id="tr_97" class="t s1_97">exactly "psychological" time. He says "eternity" because in those days the language was </div>
<div id="ts_97" class="t s1_97">understood. There was no need to make such qualifications. </div>
<div id="tt_97" class="t s1_97">The psychological time is personal. You have yours, your wife has hers, your son his; and </div>
<div id="tu_97" class="t s1_97">all are different. That is one of the causes of conflict in the world. You are honking; and </div>
<div id="tv_97" class="t s1_97">the wife says from the window, "I am coming," and she goes on standing before the </div>
<div id="tw_97" class="t s1_97">mirror and you go on honking that "It is time and we will miss the train," and she gets </div>
<div id="tx_97" class="t s1_97">angry, and you get angry. What is happening? Every husband is annoyed when he is </div>
<div id="ty_97" class="t s1_97">sitting in the driver's seat and honking the horn and the wife is still getting ready, still </div>
<div id="tz_97" class="t s1_97">getting ready. She is still choosing the sari. Now trains don't bother about which sari you </div>
<div id="t10_97" class="t s1_97">arc wearing. They leave on time. The husband is puzzled too much, what is going on. </div>
<div id="t11_97" class="t s1_97">Two different psychological times are in conflict. </div>
<div id="t12_97" class="t s1_97">Man has moved to chronological time; the woman still lives in the psychological time. As </div>
<div id="t13_97" class="t s1_97">far as I sec, women use wristwatches, but they are ornamental. I don't see that they really </div>
<div id="t14_97" class="t s1_97">use them, particularly not in India. I have come across a few women who don't know how </div>
<div id="t15_97" class="t s1_97">to tell time, and they have wristwatches, beautiful gold watches -- they can afford them. </div>
<div id="t16_97" class="t s1_97">The child lives in a totally different world. The child has his own psychological time, </div>
<div id="t17_97" class="t s1_97">completely unhurried, almost in a dream. He cannot understand you, you cannot </div>
<div id="t18_97" class="t s1_97">understand him. You are far apart; there is no way to bridge. When an old man is talking </div>
<div id="t19_97" class="t s1_97">to a child, he is talking from another planet it never reaches the child. The child cannot </div>
