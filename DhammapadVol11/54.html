<div id="t1_54" class="t s1_54">method and a few parts of another method. One can make as many methods as </div>
<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">possible, but the fundamental methods are one hundred and eight. </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">The mala has one hundred and eight beads and a locket with a picture of somebody... </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">nobody knows who he is. Somebody anonymous, somebody who is more a nobody </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">than a somebody; a man who has died long ago as a separate entity, who does not exist </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">anymore as an 'I' but is only an open space. That is where you have to reach, that is </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">where you have to arrive. That is your ultimate home. </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">The mala is not a cross. Christianity worships death and that is where it has gone </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">wrong. It has lost the joy of life, the laughter, the humor. It has lost contact with Jesus. It </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">goes on worshipping the crucified Jesus, but it is not capable of worshipping the alive </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">Jesus. </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">And my effort here is to help you to worship life, to live so joyously, with such humor, </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">that your life becomes a dance. I don't want you to become sad and serious -- sincere of </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">course, but serious, never. I would like you to go deeper into existence. Dance with the </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">flowers! Have dialogues with the stars! Look into people's eyes and love and don't hold </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">back. The only unspiritual people are those who are holding back, who are living in a </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">miserly way, who are living only partially, fragmentarily, who are not integrated. </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">And don't live an accidental life; let there be a thread running through it. The Sanskrit </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">word for thread is SUTRA. That's why these great sayings of Buddha, Patanjali, </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">Krishna, Mahavira are called sutras: these are threads. If you understand them your life </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">will not remain just a heap, an accidental heap. You will not be just driftwood at the </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">mercy of unconscious forces. Your life will become a conscious movement, your life will </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">become an art. It will have a sense of direction, and each act will be connected with </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">every other act of your life. You will not be accidental. If you are accidental you will be </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">only a noise; if you are not accidental you can become music. </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">The mala represents music, it represents harmony. It shows that you have found the </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">sutra, the thread that makes your life one whole, one piece. Life is beautiful when it is </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">one piece; life is ugly when it is fragmentary -- when you are just a crowd and when the </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">crowd is always fighting within you, when there is always a civil war. </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">Of course, the cross has influenced humanity very much, because millions of people </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">find meaning in the cross -- because it fits with their lives. Their lives are almost on the </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">cross: they are living in agony, they have never tasted what ecstasy is. </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">It is not an accident that Krishna's message has not reached millions. Just the other day I </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">was telling you that Zarathustra has not reached millions for the simple reason that he </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">loved life. Jesus has reached millions not because of himself but because of an accident </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">in his life. It is because of the Jews and the Romans: if they had not crucified him, if they </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">had tolerated him, he would have died by himself and then nobody would have heard </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">anything about him. All these churches and thousands of monks and nuns would not </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">have been seen at all -- they gathered around the cross. The cross became significant </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">because it synchronizes with something in their life. Their life is of suffering and the </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">cross represents it. They are also on the cross. Their whole life is agony, their whole life </div>
<div id="t16_54" class="t s1_54">is hell. </div>
