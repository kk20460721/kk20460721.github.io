<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">CHAPTER 10. IGNORANCE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY</div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s2_91">to tell the congregation that he had forgotten his glasses – they were eager to listen to him – so he</div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s2_91">decided to make do without the glasses and started speaking, glancing at his paper. Functioning</div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s2_91">as he did from memory, mistakes were bound to occur, because he had left his memory aid behind.</div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s2_91">Nothing he said was the imparting of true knowledge; wisdom can speak without the help of eyes,</div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s2_91">without need of spectacles. All he ever said was drawn from his crammed memory. But today the</div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s2_91">means to look into his memory was left at home.</div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s2_91">Talking about one of Jesus’ miracles he made a mistake. Jesus was in a forest with four thousand</div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s2_91">followers, and had with him only seven loaves of bread. With these he not only fed all, but the seven</div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s2_91">loaves were not eaten. There were four thousand followers but the priest made a slip and recounted</div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s2_91">that there were seven followers and four thousand loaves, and that after Jesus had fed all, the bread</div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s2_91">still remained. This, he said, was the miracle.</div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s2_91">As usually happens in a temple or a church, most of the people were dozing and paid no attention</div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s2_91">to the error; only those who were awake heard it. Even so, having left their reasoning faculties at</div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s2_91">home, as people do who go to church, they were unresponsive. They merely heard the words. Only</div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s2_91">one person became alert and thought, ”What kind of miracle is this? – only seven people and four</div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s2_91">thousand loaves?” He got up and asked, ”Sir, is this a miracle? Anybody can do that!”</div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s2_91">On hearing this, the priest was enraged. He had no idea that he had made a mistake, so he was all</div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s2_91">anger and exasperation. He asked, ”What do you mean, anybody can do it? You are blaspheming</div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s2_91">against Jesus.”</div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s2_91">The man replied, ”Why, I myself can do it!”</div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s2_91">The priest was puzzled and asked the congregation about what he had said. Someone replied, ”You</div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s2_91">made a mistake. You said the opposite of what you meant; you said there were four thousand loaves</div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s2_91">and seven followers. This feat can be accomplished by anybody, there is no miracle in it.”</div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s2_91">The priest was very troubled by this incident.</div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s2_91">He was by repute a wise man, so he was much</div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s2_91">agitated and resolved to put his challenger in his place. The next Sunday he came fully prepared.</div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s2_91">During his sermon he raised the matter of the miracle again. ”Once Jesus went to a forest,” he said.</div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s2_91">”Listen properly! He had four thousand followers and only seven loaves of bread with him, and he</div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s2_91">fed everybody. All were fed to their hearts’ content and yet the bread was not consumed.” Then he</div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s2_91">looked at the man who had put him into difﬁculty the Sunday before, and asked him, ”Dear friend,</div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s2_91">can you now perform such a miracle?”</div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s2_91">The man stood up and replied, ”Yes, I can.”</div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s2_91">The priest was very nervous and asked, ”How can you do it?”</div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s2_91">The man replied, ”I can do it from the stock that was left over from last time!”</div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s2_91">Shifting of words here and there, punning of words, memorizing words – the scriptures are all a</div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s2_91">great joke. There is not much meaning in such things. It is a great folly to try to correct others, and</div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s2_91">it is sheer vanity to try never to admit our mistakes. That poor priest could not even say, ”There</div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s2_91">was an error in my statement.” It was a triﬂe, and he could have simply asked their pardon. But our</div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s2_91">The Heartbeat of the Absolute</div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s2_91">91</div>
