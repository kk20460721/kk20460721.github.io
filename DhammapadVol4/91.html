<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">People are conventional, conformist, traditional. And to me religion is rebellion -- </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">rebellion against all conventions, against all conformities, against all traditions. Religion </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">is never a tradition, can never be a tradition. Science can be a tradition but religion </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">never. </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">Science is really a tradition. Withdraw Newton -- for a moment think as though Newton </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">was never born -- then there can be no Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein is possible only if </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">Newton happens first. Science is a tradition, it is a continuum. Withdraw one brick and </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">the whole edifice falls. </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">But I am possible without there ever being a Christ. I am possible not because there has </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">been a Mahavira or a Patanjali, not because there has been a Buddha or a Confucius or </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">Lao Tzu. Religion is not a continuum; it is an individual phenomenon, it is an </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">individual flowering. You can become awakened even if you are not aware of anybody </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">ever becoming awakened before. You are not related with the past in the same way as </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">science is related. </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">That's why scientific truths, once discovered, become the property of everybody else. </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">Albert Einstein worked hard for thirteen years to discover the theory of relativity; now </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">you can read all about it within hours -- you need not discover it again. Edison worked </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">for years, at least for three years, to discover the first electric light bulb; now you can go </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">on producing electric light bulbs -- you don't need Edisons to produce them. Ordinary </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">laborers knowing nothing of electricity can do the job -- they ARE doing it. </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">But religious truths are totally different: you have to discover them again and again. </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">What Buddha discovered does not become universal property. It dies with him, it </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">disappears with him; it is an individual flavor. That is the beauty of religion: that it </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">never becomes a commodity in the marketplace. Hence science can be taught in the </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">schools, colleges, universities; religion cannot be taught. Religion cannot be taught at </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">all; you cannot be informed about religion. You have to discover it on your own. </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">Yes, you can get the inspiration, but inspiration is not information. You can be inspired </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">by the presence of a buddha, you can become afire. You can attain to a burning longing </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">to be like a buddha, but you will have to discover everything on your own. And you </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">will not be able to give it to your children as a heritage. All that you can give, all that </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">you can impart, is an intense longing for truth, that's all -- but not truth itself. </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">Hence it is very difficult for the masses to understand what I am saying. It was difficult </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">when Buddha was here, it was difficult when Jesus was here -- it will be difficult always </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">because the masses live according to the past. They are fed, continuously brought up, in </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">traditional ways. They have been told what is right, what is wrong; they have been told </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">whether God exists or not, and they have learned all these things. And they have </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">accumulated so much information that their minds are full of knowledge; they think </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">they already know. </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">So when anybody comes and brings a new dispensation into the world, when anybody </div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s1_91">brings a new revelation, when anybody becomes available to God, becomes a vehicle of </div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">God, the people are disturbed, their prejudices are shattered. Their old conceptions are </div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s1_91">not strengthened -- on the contrary, they start feeling, "If this man is right then we have </div>
