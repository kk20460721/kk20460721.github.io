<div id="t1_120" class="t s1_120">Jesus and Moses were playing golf. When they came to a two-hundred-yard water </div>
<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">hazard. Jesus took out a five iron club. Moses warned him that two hundred yards were </div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">too far for a five-iron, but Jesus insisted, "If Arnold Palmer can make it with a five-iron, </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">so can I!" </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">He hit the ball and it landed in the middle of the lake. </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">"Will you get the ball for me, Moses?" asked Jesus. </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">"Just this once," he replied, walked over, raised his club, and parted the water. Then he </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">walked out and brought the ball back to Jesus. </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">Again Jesus took a five-iron and again Moses warned, "If you don't make it, I'm not </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">going to get it for you!" </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">Jesus reassured him, "If Arnold Palmer can do it, surely I can do it!" </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">Again he swung the five-iron and again the ball fell in the water. This time Jesus walked </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">out on the water, reached down, and was picking up the ball when the next foursome </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">came up to the tee where Moses was standing. The leader of the group asked Moses, </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">"Who does he think he is, Jesus Christ?" </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">"No," replied Moses, "he thinks he is Arnold Palmer!" </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">Govind, you just be Govind the Buddha. There is no need for you to be Gautama the </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">Buddha. Gautama was beautiful, but once it is beautiful -- twice it is too much. And </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">what is the point? What will your contribution to existence be if you are Gautama the </div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">Buddha? No contribution. Gautama has done it, he has done what a Gautama can do. </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">You cannot improve upon it. </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">You do something that YOU can do and no Gautama can ever do. God has great hopes </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">for you: he hopes you will contribute something to existence. He never loses hope, that's </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">why he goes on creating people. Although people go on deceiving, people go on </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">misusing the opportunity, people go on wasting time, but still God goes on hoping. </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">With each child a new hope is born in the world. You have to contribute something that </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">only you can do and nobody else can do, hence YOU have to do it. Forget this whole </div>
<div id="ts_120" class="t s1_120">idea of being Gautama the Buddha -- just be yourself. </div>
<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">And that's exactly what Buddha has taught, that's exactly his essential message. His last </div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">words to his disciples were: APPA DEEPO BHAVA -- be a light unto yourself. </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">When he was dying, naturally thousands of disciples had gathered and they started </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">crying and weeping. The master was leaving, it was natural, and the master had lived </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">with them for forty-two years and they had loved the man, they had loved his vibe. He </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">was one of the most beautiful men who has ever walked on the earth. Not only was he </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">spiritually beautiful, physically he was also one of the most beautiful men. About Jesus </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">that cannot be said. He was spiritually beautiful, but the ancient scriptures say that </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">physically he was not beautiful. He was only four feet five inches and, moreover, a </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">hunchback. Buddha was one of the most beautiful expressions physically too, really a </div>
<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">lotus flower. And they had all loved him. They had renounced everything and risked </div>
<div id="t14_120" class="t s1_120">everything for this man and now he was leaving. They started crying. One can </div>
<div id="t15_120" class="t s1_120">understand their crying and their weeping and their tears. </div>
