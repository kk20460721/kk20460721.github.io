<div id="t2_29" class="t s1_29">you will not think that you are doing anything. Love is not a duty. In love, work </div>
<div id="t3_29" class="t s1_29">becomes worship. </div>
<div id="t4_29" class="t s1_29">You work in the ashram. The whole quality of the work, and your attitude, will </div>
<div id="t5_29" class="t s1_29">be different if you love me. If you don't love me, of course it is work. Then your </div>
<div id="t6_29" class="t s1_29">mind will hanker for praise. Then in many ways you will try to avoid the work -- </div>
<div id="t7_29" class="t s1_29">as many of you are doing! You go on finding ways and means: how to avoid it, </div>
<div id="t8_29" class="t s1_29">how not to do it. </div>
<div id="t9_29" class="t s1_29">I never avoid, because I love you. The more I can do. the better I feel. But you </div>
<div id="ta_29" class="t s1_29">avoid -- as if work is something that you are dragging: a burden. If work is a </div>
<div id="tb_29" class="t s1_29">burden, only then it looks like work. </div>
<div id="tc_29" class="t s1_29">If work comes out of love, it becomes worship. Then there is no need for any </div>
<div id="td_29" class="t s1_29">other meditation. It is enough. The work itself becomes the meditation. You are </div>
<div id="te_29" class="t s1_29">so deeply in it that the mind stops. </div>
<div id="tf_29" class="t s1_29">Energy needs work otherwise the energy will become restlessness. Energy needs </div>
<div id="tg_29" class="t s1_29">expression, energy needs to be creative. Otherwise the same energy, coiled up </div>
<div id="th_29" class="t s1_29">within you, will become diseased, an illness. You have energy. The energy has to </div>
<div id="ti_29" class="t s1_29">be creative. There is no happiness except in creativity. </div>
<div id="tj_29" class="t s1_29">But creativity is work, with love. A painter paints. He is not working; he is </div>
<div id="tk_29" class="t s1_29">loving. He is completely absorbed in it -- the doer is not there. A singer sings or a </div>
<div id="tl_29" class="t s1_29">dancer dances. If the dancer is just a professional then it is work. Then he will be </div>
<div id="tm_29" class="t s1_29">tired. But if a dancer really loves dancing, then the more he moves into it, the </div>
<div id="tn_29" class="t s1_29">more energy he gets to move further on. </div>
<div id="to_29" class="t s1_29">It is said about Nijinsky -- one of the greatest dancers that has ever walked on </div>
<div id="tp_29" class="t s1_29">earth -- that even scientists were surprised: they couldn't believe his jumping. </div>
<div id="tq_29" class="t s1_29">When he would dance he would take jumps that were so big they were against </div>
<div id="tr_29" class="t s1_29">gravitation. They were not possible: one cannot jump that much. And the way he </div>
<div id="ts_29" class="t s1_29">would jump -- so gracefully! And when he would be coming down he would </div>
<div id="tt_29" class="t s1_29">come like a dove -- so slowly, as if gravitation was not functioning. Many times </div>
<div id="tu_29" class="t s1_29">Nijinsky was asked, "What is the secret?" </div>
<div id="tv_29" class="t s1_29">He said, "I don't know. Except that I love dancing." And once he said, "When you </div>
<div id="tw_29" class="t s1_29">love dancing, then you don't function under the law of gravitation. You function </div>
<div id="tx_29" class="t s1_29">under the law of grace." </div>
<div id="ty_29" class="t s1_29">That is the difference between Moses and Jesus. Moses brings the law of </div>
<div id="tz_29" class="t s1_29">gravitation into the world -- all those Ten Commandments are laws, just like </div>
<div id="t10_29" class="t s1_29">gravitation -- and Jesus brings the law of grace, which is not a law at all. </div>
<div id="t11_29" class="t s1_29">When you love deeply, you function in a totally different dimension. If you </div>
<div id="t12_29" class="t s1_29">loved me, this question would not have arisen. You would not think of it as </div>
<div id="t13_29" class="t s1_29">work. </div>
<div id="t14_29" class="t s1_29">Watch a mother -- how much she does for the child. But if you ask her, she will </div>
<div id="t15_29" class="t s1_29">say, "I have not been doing anything. In fact many more things were needed to </div>
<div id="t16_29" class="t s1_29">be done and I have not done them. I always feel that my child has not received as </div>
<div id="t17_29" class="t s1_29">much care as was needed." Then go to the secretary of a club or an institute and </div>
