<div id="t3_46" class="t s1_46">stuck. The mind will ask for more. </div>
<div id="t4_46" class="t s1_46">The mind lives through more, and the more cannot be fulfilled; that is impossible. IT </div>
<div id="t5_46" class="t s1_46">ENDS IN TEARS. Every desire ends in frustration, because every expectation is the </div>
<div id="t6_46" class="t s1_46">beginning of frustration. Why does every desire end in frustration? There are only two </div>
<div id="t7_46" class="t s1_46">alternatives: either you achieve your object of desire or you don't achieve it, but in both </div>
<div id="t8_46" class="t s1_46">cases it will end in tears. If you achieve it you will see the utter futility of it all. </div>
<div id="t9_46" class="t s1_46">The rich man sees the futility of his riches -- how much he has labored, and how much </div>
<div id="ta_46" class="t s1_46">he has worked for it! And now, whatsoever he has attained is absolutely useless, it </div>
<div id="tb_46" class="t s1_46">fulfills nothing. You can have two houses or three houses, one in the city, one in the </div>
<div id="tc_46" class="t s1_46">hills, one on the seashore, but you are the same person, as empty as before. You can live </div>
<div id="td_46" class="t s1_46">in a palace, but how can you change your inner meaninglessness? You will be as </div>
<div id="te_46" class="t s1_46">meaningless in a palace as you are in a hut. </div>
<div id="tf_46" class="t s1_46">In fact, you will be more meaningless in a palace, because while you are in a hut you </div>
<div id="tg_46" class="t s1_46">can still hope that one day when you have managed to get into a palace, everything will </div>
<div id="th_46" class="t s1_46">be okay. You can hope, but the man who IS in the palace, he has no hope, he feels </div>
<div id="ti_46" class="t s1_46">utterly hopeless. And he cannot say it to others either, because that will be stupid of </div>

<div id="tk_46" class="t s1_46">....</div>
<div id="tl_46" class="t s1_46">Just think of Alexander the Great: he devoted his whole life to conquering the world. </div>
<div id="tm_46" class="t s1_46">And when he had conquered it, if he had said to the world that "It was useless. I wasted </div>
<div id="tn_46" class="t s1_46">my time and my life," people would have thought he was stupid. Could he not see it </div>
<div id="to_46" class="t s1_46">before? </div>
<div id="tp_46" class="t s1_46">There is an ancient story in India: </div>
<div id="tq_46" class="t s1_46">A henpecked husband asked somebody, "What to do? My wife is so dominating." </div>
<div id="tr_46" class="t s1_46">The friend suggested, "You should not have allowed it from the very beginning, but </div>
<div id="ts_46" class="t s1_46">now it is difficult. Still it is not too late. Today you get drunk so that you can have </div>
<div id="tt_46" class="t s1_46">courage. Then go and shout and knock on the door and enter into the house and throw </div>
<div id="tu_46" class="t s1_46">things and let her feel that you are a man. And beat her, give her a good beating! Settle </div>
<div id="tv_46" class="t s1_46">it once and for all." </div>
<div id="tw_46" class="t s1_46">So the man got drunk, although he was afraid that, "These things seem to be impossible </div>
<div id="tx_46" class="t s1_46">-- I cannot do it. But maybe the drink will help." </div>
<div id="ty_46" class="t s1_46">He drank and he felt really great, puffed up, but as he approached the house, slowly </div>
<div id="tz_46" class="t s1_46">slowly he became sober; the effect of the alcohol was disappearing. The fear was </div>
<div id="t10_46" class="t s1_46">arising, but he kept himself courageous by repeating, "The man is a wise man, and at </div>
<div id="t11_46" class="t s1_46">least if I can do it once it will be finished forever. And it is worth doing it." </div>
<div id="t12_46" class="t s1_46">So he knocked on the door, shouted, entered inside, started throwing things. </div>
<div id="t13_46" class="t s1_46">His wife was very angry. She was so angry she cut off the nose of the man with a knife. </div>
<div id="t14_46" class="t s1_46">Now without a nose it was very difficult to live in the town, so the man escaped from </div>
<div id="t15_46" class="t s1_46">the town in the night -- that same night he escaped. But wherever he would go, people </div>
<div id="t16_46" class="t s1_46">would ask, "What happened to your nose?" </div>
