<div id="t3_105" class="t s1_105">pendulum you will know something about your mind. When the pendulum is </div>
<div id="t4_105" class="t s1_105">moving towards the left, visibly it is going to the left, but invisibly it is gaining </div>
<div id="t5_105" class="t s1_105">momentum to go to the right. When the eyes say that the pendulum is going to </div>
<div id="t6_105" class="t s1_105">the left, that very movement towards the left creates the momentum, the energy, </div>
<div id="t7_105" class="t s1_105">for the pendulum to go to the right again. When it is going to the right it is again </div>
<div id="t8_105" class="t s1_105">earning energy, gaining energy to go to the left. </div>

<div id="tc_105" class="t s1_105">gaining energy to feel happy. This is how the momentum continues. </div>
<div id="td_105" class="t s1_105">I have heard that when India became independent in 1947, there was a beautiful </div>
<div id="te_105" class="t s1_105">elephant in Delhi. Before independence the elephant was used in wedding </div>
<div id="tf_105" class="t s1_105">processions and other things like that, but after the independence even political </div>
<div id="tg_105" class="t s1_105">parties started using the elephant in their rallies, processions, protests. The </div>
<div id="th_105" class="t s1_105">elephant had something like a flaw. The legs on his left side were a little shorter, </div>
<div id="ti_105" class="t s1_105">so when the elephant walked he would lean towards the left. </div>
<div id="tj_105" class="t s1_105">Communists were very happy, socialists were very happy -- the elephant was </div>
<div id="tk_105" class="t s1_105">leftist. So they paid money to the owner to borrow the elephant; and they </div>
<div id="tl_105" class="t s1_105">clapped, and their followers threw flowers on the elephant. Really, this is how an </div>
<div id="tm_105" class="t s1_105">elephant should be -- leftist. Of course, it was very difficult for the elephant to </div>
<div id="tn_105" class="t s1_105">walk, but who bothers about the elephant? It was difficult because two legs were </div>
<div id="to_105" class="t s1_105">small, and the whole burden was falling on the left legs. An elephant has much </div>
<div id="tp_105" class="t s1_105">weight; it was difficult. Tons of weight have to be carried. But flowers, garlands... </div>
<div id="tq_105" class="t s1_105">and he was received, and photographs were published in newspapers: that this is </div>
<div id="tr_105" class="t s1_105">a communist elephant. </div>
<div id="ts_105" class="t s1_105">Seeing that, that communists and socialists and other leftists have a beautiful </div>

<div id="tu_105" class="t s1_105">borrowed the same elephant -- not knowing that the elephant is a leftist elephant. </div>
<div id="tv_105" class="t s1_105">When the elephant went with the rightists they were very angry. This elephant </div>
<div id="tw_105" class="t s1_105">was against them: he should lean towards the right. They started throwing old </div>
<div id="tx_105" class="t s1_105">shoes, tomatoes, banana peels, and all rotten things. In short, they gave him a </div>
<div id="ty_105" class="t s1_105">VIP treatment. They were very angry. They were angry at the owner also, and </div>
<div id="tz_105" class="t s1_105">they told the owner, "Next time we take it, you make arrangements." </div>

<div id="t11_105" class="t s1_105">was his only earning. So he made big shoes. Then whenever it w as a rightist </div>
<div id="t12_105" class="t s1_105">procession he would put on the big shoes, and the animal would lean towards </div>
<div id="t13_105" class="t s1_105">the right; and whenever it was a leftist procession, he would remove the shoes. </div>
<div id="t14_105" class="t s1_105">Nobody bothered about the elephant. One day the elephant fell, just in </div>
<div id="t15_105" class="t s1_105">Connaught Place, because it was too much to carry that big load with shoes. And </div>
<div id="t16_105" class="t s1_105">it was so uncomfortable -- it was not an asan. It was really uncomfortable. He fell </div>
<div id="t17_105" class="t s1_105">and died. </div>
