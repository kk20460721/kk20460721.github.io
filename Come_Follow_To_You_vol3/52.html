<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">deeper ways to say things. Sometimes to remain silent is the only way to speak. </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">I have heard, that in one museum in Europe, there is a piano on which Wagner </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">used to play. A woman came there to see it, and she was just a learner, just </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">knowing only the ABC of it. She immediately started playing on the piano. The </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">guide was shocked, but he was a very polite man, so he remained silent. After a </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">few strokes, the woman said that many great musicians must have come to the </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">museum to see this piano of Wagner, and they all must have played on it. </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">The guide said, "Madam, you are the first. Great musicians come here. They </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">stand absolutely silent. And I have heard them say,'We are not worthy even to </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">touch it'. They remain in silence; they don't utter a single word. The moment they </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">see this, the master's piano, it is as if they become dumb. They don't touch it. </div>
<div id="ts_52" class="t s1_52">They say,'We are not worthy of it.' In their deep silence, they say something. </div>
<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">When you love a woman, in deep silence much is said. When somebody comes </div>

<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">not in deep rapport with it; otherwise the chattering would stop. If he starts </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">saying something about it, that shows that he is trying to show his knowledge </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">about paintings. Otherwise, before a great painting one becomes silent; one has </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">nothing to say. Language is lost; one becomes dumb. The mind stops. </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">When you love a person, you share; you don't ask for recognition. If you ask </div>

<div id="t14_52" class="t s1_52">then it has tremendous beauty. That is the difference between great art and </div>
<div id="t15_52" class="t s1_52">mediocre art, and that is the difference between Eastern art and Western art. </div>
