<div id="t1_29" class="t s1_29">horsemen in front of his carriage and behind the carriage there were also </div>
<div id="t2_29" class="t s1_29">horsemen, and a golden parasol was held over the head of the king. </div>
<div id="t3_29" class="t s1_29">And when the rich man saw this, he was vexed that no golden parasol was held </div>
<div id="t4_29" class="t s1_29">over his own head and he was not content. He sighed and cried, 'I wish to be a </div>
<div id="t5_29" class="t s1_29">king.' And the angel came again and he said, 'You are what you have said.' </div>
<div id="t6_29" class="t s1_29">And he was king and many horsemen rode in front of his carriage, and there </div>
<div id="t7_29" class="t s1_29">were also horsemen behind his carriage and a golden parasol was held over his </div>
<div id="t8_29" class="t s1_29">head, and the sun shone hot rays and scorched the earth so that the grass shoots </div>
<div id="t9_29" class="t s1_29">withered. And the king complained that the sun burned his face and that it </div>
<div id="ta_29" class="t s1_29">excelled him in power and he was not content. He sighed and cried, 'I wish to be </div>
<div id="tb_29" class="t s1_29">the sun.' And the angel came and he said, 'You are what you have said.' </div>
<div id="tc_29" class="t s1_29">And he was the sun and he directed his rays upward and down, to the right and </div>
<div id="td_29" class="t s1_29">to the left -- everywhere -- and he scorched the grass shoots on earth, and the </div>
<div id="te_29" class="t s1_29">countenances of kings who were on earth. </div>
<div id="tf_29" class="t s1_29">And a cloud placed itself between him and the earth, and the rays of the sun </div>
<div id="tg_29" class="t s1_29">bounced back from it and he grew wrathful that his power was resisted. He </div>
<div id="th_29" class="t s1_29">complained that the cloud excelled him in power and he was not content. He </div>
<div id="ti_29" class="t s1_29">wished to be the cloud, which was so powerful, and the angel came and he said, </div>
<div id="tj_29" class="t s1_29">'You are what you have said.' </div>
<div id="tk_29" class="t s1_29">And he became a cloud and placed himself between the sun and the earth and </div>
<div id="tl_29" class="t s1_29">caught the rays so that the grass grew green. The cloud rained large drops on the </div>
<div id="tm_29" class="t s1_29">earth causing the rivers to swell and floods to carry the houses away, and he </div>
<div id="tn_29" class="t s1_29">destroyed the fields with much water. He fell upon a rock which did not yield, </div>
<div id="to_29" class="t s1_29">and he splashed in great streams, but the rock did not yield, and he grew </div>
<div id="tp_29" class="t s1_29">wrathful because the rock was not yielding to his power, and the power of his </div>
<div id="tq_29" class="t s1_29">streams was in vain and he was not content. </div>
<div id="tr_29" class="t s1_29">He cried, 'That rock has been given power which excells mine. I wish to be the </div>
<div id="ts_29" class="t s1_29">rock.' And the angel came and he was the rock, he did become the rock, and did </div>
<div id="tt_29" class="t s1_29">not move when the sun shone nor when it rained. </div>
<div id="tu_29" class="t s1_29">And then there was a man with a pick and with a chisel and with a heavy </div>
<div id="tv_29" class="t s1_29">hammer, and he hewed stones out of the rock and the rock said, 'How can it be </div>
<div id="tw_29" class="t s1_29">that this man has power that excells mine and hews stones out of my lap?' and he </div>
<div id="tx_29" class="t s1_29">was not content. </div>
<div id="ty_29" class="t s1_29">He cried, 'I am weaker than he. I wish to be that man.' And the angel came from </div>
<div id="tz_29" class="t s1_29">heaven, saying, 'You are what you have said.' </div>
<div id="t10_29" class="t s1_29">And he was a stone-cutter again. And he hewed stones from the rock with hard </div>
<div id="t11_29" class="t s1_29">labour, and he laboured very hard for small wages -- and he was content. </div>
<div id="t12_29" class="t s1_29">I don't agree with the conclusion. That is the only disagreement with the story; </div>
<div id="t13_29" class="t s1_29">otherwise the story is beautiful. I don't agree with the conclusion. Because I </div>
<div id="t14_29" class="t s1_29">know people -- they cannot be so easily content. The wheel is complete. The story </div>
<div id="t15_29" class="t s1_29">in a way has come to a natural end, but the real stories in life don't come to any </div>
<div id="t16_29" class="t s1_29">natural end. The wheel again starts moving. </div>
