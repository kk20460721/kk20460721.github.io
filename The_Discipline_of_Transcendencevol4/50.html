<div id="t2_50" class="t s1_50">one meal every day; Srona would take only two meals every week. The </div>
<div id="t3_50" class="t s1_50">BHIKKHUS would walk, move from one town to another; then they would walk </div>
<div id="t4_50" class="t s1_50">on the road. But this Srona would never walk on the path. He would walk in the </div>
<div id="t5_50" class="t s1_50">forest, would get hurt. His feet would start bleeding; there were wounds. </div>
<div id="t6_50" class="t s1_50">Buddha's BHIKKHUS were very tranquil people, silent people -- because the </div>
<div id="t7_50" class="t s1_50">whole teaching is to remain in the middle. They were never indulgent and they </div>
<div id="t8_50" class="t s1_50">were never ascetic, but this Srona became a great ascetic. When everybody </div>
<div id="t9_50" class="t s1_50">would be sitting under the trees, he would stand in the hot sun. He had a </div>
<div id="ta_50" class="t s1_50">beautiful body, he was a beautiful young man. He became dark, black, and </div>
<div id="tb_50" class="t s1_50">within a few months it was impossible to recognize him. When people from his </div>
<div id="tc_50" class="t s1_50">capital would come they would be surprised; he had changed so much. He had </div>
<div id="td_50" class="t s1_50">become lean and thin, his eyes had lost luster, his face had lost all grace; he had </div>
<div id="te_50" class="t s1_50">started becoming ugly. And he was always ill, because the body has a limit of </div>
<div id="tf_50" class="t s1_50">tolerance to certain things. But he was not worried; in fact, he was enjoying it. </div>
<div id="tg_50" class="t s1_50">And all the monks started feeling that he was some great soul. Everybody started </div>
<div id="th_50" class="t s1_50">feeling that he was superior to them. Now a new ego was arising in Srona. </div>
<div id="ti_50" class="t s1_50">This sutra is about Srona. </div>
<div id="tj_50" class="t s1_50">ONE NIGHT A MONK WAS RECITING A SUTRA BEQUEATHED BY </div>
<div id="tk_50" class="t s1_50">KASHYAPABUDDHA. HIS TONE WAS SO MOURNFUL AND HIS VOICE SO </div>
<div id="tl_50" class="t s1_50">FAINTING, AS IF HE WERE GOING OUT OF EXISTENCE. </div>
<div id="tm_50" class="t s1_50">Of course he must have become very sad, he must have become very low and </div>
<div id="tn_50" class="t s1_50">depressed, he must have lost all joy. He was torturing himself. He must have </div>
<div id="to_50" class="t s1_50">been a little masochistic. He was destroying himself and enjoying the violence. </div>
<div id="tp_50" class="t s1_50">He must have become very serious, a long-face; he must have become very </div>
<div id="tq_50" class="t s1_50">deeply ill, all well-being disappeared. He was not a flowering. In fact, the tree </div>
<div id="tr_50" class="t s1_50">was dying. </div>
<div id="ts_50" class="t s1_50">He was reciting this sutra given by Kashyapabuddha. When you recite a sutra </div>
<div id="tt_50" class="t s1_50">you have to recite it in joy -- otherwise it is meaningless. When you pray, if you </div>
<div id="tu_50" class="t s1_50">cannot pray joyfully, it is meaningless -- don't waste your time. Because your </div>
<div id="tv_50" class="t s1_50">prayer never reaches God unless it rides on the horse of joy. Unless you can </div>
<div id="tw_50" class="t s1_50">celebrate, your prayer is never heard. Only through celebration does it reach to </div>
