<div id="tc_178" class="t s1_178">other it is lost. </div>
<div id="td_178" class="t s1_178">There is a story about Bayazid, a Sufi mystic. </div>
<div id="te_178" class="t s1_178">He was passing through a cemetery and he came upon a heap of skulls. Out of </div>
<div id="tf_178" class="t s1_178">curiosity he took one skull. He had always been of the thought that all skulls are </div>
<div id="tg_178" class="t s1_178">almost the same, but they were not the same. There were a few skulls whose ears </div>
<div id="th_178" class="t s1_178">were joined together; there was a passage. There were a few skulls whose ears </div>
<div id="ti_178" class="t s1_178">were not joined together; there was a barrier between the two. There were a few </div>
<div id="tj_178" class="t s1_178">skulls both of whose ears were joined to the heart but not joined together; there </div>
<div id="tk_178" class="t s1_178">was a passage running to the heart. </div>
<div id="tl_178" class="t s1_178">He was very surprised. He prayed and asked God, "What is the matter? What are </div>
<div id="tm_178" class="t s1_178">you trying to reveal to me?" And it is said that he heard a voice. God said, "There </div>
<div id="tn_178" class="t s1_178">are three types of people: one, who hear through one ear; it never reaches </div>
<div id="to_178" class="t s1_178">anywhere -- in fact they don't hear, just the sound vibrates and disappears. There </div>
<div id="tp_178" class="t s1_178">is another type, who hear, but only momentarily -- they hear through one ear, </div>
<div id="tq_178" class="t s1_178">and through the other ear it is lost into the world again. There are a few souls, of </div>
<div id="tr_178" class="t s1_178">course, who hear through the ears and it reaches to the heart." </div>
<div id="ts_178" class="t s1_178">And God said, "Bayazid, I have brought you to this heap of skulls just to help </div>
<div id="tt_178" class="t s1_178">you remember it when you are talking to people. Talk only to those who take </div>
<div id="tu_178" class="t s1_178">whatsoever you say to their hearts -- otherwise don't waste your energy, and </div>
<div id="tv_178" class="t s1_178">don't waste your time. Your life is precious: you have a message to deliver." </div>
<div id="tw_178" class="t s1_178">One day I also understood -- not by going to a cemetery and coming across a </div>
<div id="tx_178" class="t s1_178">heap, but by looking into alive people. There are three types; Bayazid is right. </div>
<div id="ty_178" class="t s1_178">The story may be true or not; that is irrelevant. I looked into thousands of people, </div>
<div id="tz_178" class="t s1_178">and I found that only a very few are there who will take the seed to the heart, </div>
<div id="t10_178" class="t s1_178">who will become soil to it, who will absorb it. And others are just curiosity-</div>
<div id="t11_178" class="t s1_178">mongers, just entertaining themselves. Maybe the entertainment is religious, but </div>
<div id="t12_178" class="t s1_178">it is meaningless. </div>
<div id="t13_178" class="t s1_178">So here I don't exist for the masses. Let it be known once and forever: I am not </div>
<div id="t14_178" class="t s1_178">interested in the crowd, I am interested only in individuals. And you have to </div>
<div id="t15_178" class="t s1_178">show your mettle. </div>
