<div id="t2_97" class="t s1_97">cannot give you that for which you have not asked; they cannot give you that for </div>
<div id="t3_97" class="t s1_97">which you are not ready. They can only give you that for which you have come. </div>
<div id="t4_97" class="t s1_97">It depends on you who Jesus will prove to you to be. He is a response, he reflects </div>
<div id="t5_97" class="t s1_97">you. Remember this. Because of this, many complexities have arisen. Many </div>
<div id="t6_97" class="t s1_97">people will give you different reports. They all are true -- and no one is totally </div>
<div id="t7_97" class="t s1_97">true. They all talk only of facets, parts of Jesus that have been revealed to them. </div>
<div id="t8_97" class="t s1_97">Hence so many stories</div>
<div id="t9_97" class="t s1_97">....</div>
<div id="ta_97" class="t s1_97">Buddha died and immediately there was great turmoil amongst his followers. </div>
<div id="tb_97" class="t s1_97">The sangha divided into many parts. The community could not remain one </div>
<div id="tc_97" class="t s1_97">because there were different reports -- as if Buddha was not one man but many. </div>
<div id="td_97" class="t s1_97">He was one, absolutely one, but he reflected so many people that they knew him </div>
<div id="te_97" class="t s1_97">in different ways -- according to their capacity, according to their receptivity, </div>
<div id="tf_97" class="t s1_97">according to their readiness. They all said different things. Not only different, but </div>
<div id="tg_97" class="t s1_97">quite contradictory to each other. The community had to divide. </div>
<div id="th_97" class="t s1_97">The same happened with Mahavir: the community had to divide. The same </div>
<div id="ti_97" class="t s1_97">happened with Jesus: the community could not remain one. And the reason is: </div>
<div id="tj_97" class="t s1_97">Jesus is different to different people. He has to be, he is just a pure mirror. You </div>
<div id="tk_97" class="t s1_97">come and he reveals your face to yourself. He exists so that you can realize </div>
<div id="tl_97" class="t s1_97">yourself, He has no other idea to force upon you, He has no idea at all, he is </div>
<div id="tm_97" class="t s1_97">simply a helper. If you come to him in search of knowledge, he will reveal that to </div>
<div id="tn_97" class="t s1_97">you. If you come to him in search of love, you will be benefitted by his </div>
<div id="to_97" class="t s1_97">compassion and love. If you come to him as a sinner, he will give you salvation. </div>
<div id="tp_97" class="t s1_97">But it depends on you; he echoes you. </div>
<div id="tq_97" class="t s1_97">This has to be understood. Then these sutras will be very simple. </div>
<div id="tr_97" class="t s1_97">AND THE DISCIPLES CAME, AND SAID UNTO HIM, WHY SPEAKEST THOU </div>
<div id="ts_97" class="t s1_97">UNTO THEM IN PARABLES? </div>
<div id="tt_97" class="t s1_97">The disciples were noticing that whenever he talks to the masses, he always talks </div>
<div id="tu_97" class="t s1_97">in parables. Whenever he talks to them in privacy, he talks differently. </div>
<div id="tv_97" class="t s1_97">It has to be so. A disciple is different. A disciple is one who has committed his </div>
<div id="tw_97" class="t s1_97">a]l. He's not just a follower. A follower is one who is impressed and still </div>
<div id="tx_97" class="t s1_97">hesitating. And the ordinary masses are neither followers nor disciples. They </div>
<div id="ty_97" class="t s1_97">may be curious to know who this man is, they may be intrigued by this man, </div>
<div id="tz_97" class="t s1_97">they may be amused by this man -- a few of them may become followers later on </div>
<div id="t10_97" class="t s1_97">and a few of the followers may become disciples later on -- but the masses are </div>
<div id="t11_97" class="t s1_97">still not related to him. </div>
<div id="t12_97" class="t s1_97">They have come to him as curiosity seekers, just by the way. Somebody has told </div>
<div id="t13_97" class="t s1_97">them, "Here comes Jesus. A great man, the son of God," and they got interested. </div>
<div id="t14_97" class="t s1_97">They may lose interest again, they may go on their paths and forget everything </div>
<div id="t15_97" class="t s1_97">about him -- or. at the most, he may remain a beautiful memory -- but he will not </div>
<div id="t16_97" class="t s1_97">be a transformation to them. </div>
