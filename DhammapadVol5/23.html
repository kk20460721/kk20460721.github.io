<div id="t1_23" class="t s1_23">because he would never answer clearly whether God exists or not. On the contrary, he </div>
<div id="t2_23" class="t s1_23">would divert the question into something else; he might start talking about something </div>
<div id="t3_23" class="t s1_23">else. And his impact and his magnetism were such that you would forget all about what </div>
<div id="t4_23" class="t s1_23">you had come to ask him; you would remember only later on that he deceived you. You </div>
<div id="t5_23" class="t s1_23">had asked about God and he didn't say a single word about it. </div>
<div id="t6_23" class="t s1_23">Many thought, "He does not believe in God and that's why he keeps silent about God, </div>
<div id="t7_23" class="t s1_23">because he is afraid that if he says no then religious people will leave him." Many </div>
<div id="t8_23" class="t s1_23">thought, "He knows God is, but he does not say so because he does not want the </div>
<div id="t9_23" class="t s1_23">atheists to leave him." And many thought, "Because he knows nothing, he is utterly </div>
<div id="ta_23" class="t s1_23">ignorant, that's why he remains silent about the most fundamental question." But they </div>
<div id="tb_23" class="t s1_23">were all wrong. </div>
<div id="tc_23" class="t s1_23">He was silent because God means something which is transcendental; yes is irrelevant </div>
<div id="td_23" class="t s1_23">as much as no is irrelevant. Nothing can be said about God; to be silent about him is the </div>
<div id="te_23" class="t s1_23">only right answer. He was REALLY answering. Very few, rare people understood him. </div>
<div id="tf_23" class="t s1_23">Once a man came. He touched Buddha's feet and asked him, "Does God exist?" -- the </div>
<div id="tg_23" class="t s1_23">perennial question. </div>
<div id="th_23" class="t s1_23">Buddha said -- that was always his way, it will show you his method -- he said, "When I </div>
<div id="ti_23" class="t s1_23">was young I used to love horses very much." Now, the man is asking about God, and he </div>
<div id="tj_23" class="t s1_23">starts talking about horses! But he was a sweet talker... the man became interested in </div>
<div id="tk_23" class="t s1_23">horses, and Buddha said, "I came across four kinds of horses. One is the most stupid </div>
<div id="tl_23" class="t s1_23">and stubborn kind: you beat the horse, still he would not budge. Many people are like </div>
<div id="tm_23" class="t s1_23">that. The second kind is: you beat him and he would move, but he would move only if </div>
<div id="tn_23" class="t s1_23">you beat him, if you whip him. Many people are like that. And the third kind you need </div>
<div id="to_23" class="t s1_23">not beat -- you simply show him the whip and that's enough; if he knows you have the </div>
<div id="tp_23" class="t s1_23">whip in your hand, that's enough. And I have also come across very rare horses: even </div>
<div id="tq_23" class="t s1_23">the whip is not needed -- just the shadow of the whip is enough." </div>
<div id="tr_23" class="t s1_23">And then he closed his eyes and sat silently. The man also closed his eyes and sat in </div>
<div id="ts_23" class="t s1_23">silence with Buddha. </div>
<div id="tt_23" class="t s1_23">Buddha's chief disciple, Ananda, was present; he was watching the whole thing. He </div>
<div id="tu_23" class="t s1_23">could see that the man had asked about God, and Ananda was also curious about what </div>
<div id="tv_23" class="t s1_23">Buddha was going to say -- and he started talking about horses! Ananda was not happy </div>
<div id="tw_23" class="t s1_23">about it: "This is no way, this is devious, this is cheating the person. He is asking about </div>
<div id="tx_23" class="t s1_23">God and you talk about horses!" He made it a point, "When this man is gone I am going </div>
<div id="ty_23" class="t s1_23">to ask. This is too much! If he talks about God, at least you can talk about meditation, </div>
<div id="tz_23" class="t s1_23">but not about horses! If you don't want to talk about God, talk about meditation, talk </div>
<div id="t10_23" class="t s1_23">about silence, but something relevant. Talk about desirelessness, or at least you can say, </div>
<div id="t11_23" class="t s1_23">'God is indefinable. Nothing can be said about God, but I can show you the way so you </div>
<div id="t12_23" class="t s1_23">can also experience it.' That would be right, compassionate. But what kind of a joke is </div>
<div id="t13_23" class="t s1_23">this -- you talk about horses?" </div>
<div id="t14_23" class="t s1_23">But more than that, he was puzzled when Buddha closed his eyes and the man also </div>
<div id="t15_23" class="t s1_23">followed. And there was such great silence, so solid, so substantial, almost tangible; you </div>
<div id="t16_23" class="t s1_23">could have touched it, you could have felt the texture of it. Ananda was not a very silent </div>
