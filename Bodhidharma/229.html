<div id="t2_229" class="t s1_229">reading late into the night, finding new arguments, and the next day he simply </div>
<div id="t3_229" class="t s1_229">refutes them. He is working harder than me. Of course he is young and it is very </div>
<div id="t4_229" class="t s1_229">humiliating to get defeated every day. I resign. I will not come to the college </div>
<div id="t5_229" class="t s1_229">again if you don't expel him." And he left for his home. </div>
<div id="t6_229" class="t s1_229">The principal called me. He knew me. I had brought so many trophies and so </div>
<div id="t7_229" class="t s1_229">many cups from all over the country, from all the universities, for debating, for </div>
<div id="t8_229" class="t s1_229">eloquence competitions ... He was very happy that I had made his college </div>
<div id="t9_229" class="t s1_229">famous nationwide. </div>
<div id="ta_229" class="t s1_229">He said, "I'm in a difficulty. Why are you irritating that old man? He is our oldest </div>
<div id="tb_229" class="t s1_229">professor, well educated; he has two Ph.D.'s, has been conferred D.Litt. recently </div>
<div id="tc_229" class="t s1_229">by the university. He is a well-known scholar and we cannot lose him." </div>
<div id="td_229" class="t s1_229">I said, "You can keep him, but you are being unfair and unjust because I have not </div>
<div id="te_229" class="t s1_229">done anything harmful to him. He is the professor of logic and if a professor of </div>
<div id="tf_229" class="t s1_229">logic cannot argue with a student, then who is going to argue? The whole subject </div>
<div id="tg_229" class="t s1_229">of logic is argument and sharpening of arguments, and I'm really doing my work </div>
<div id="th_229" class="t s1_229">as every student should do. The students are behaving like dodos; they don't </div>
<div id="ti_229" class="t s1_229">bother about the subject. They have other interests -- somebody has a girlfriend, </div>
<div id="tj_229" class="t s1_229">somebody has an interest in the movies -- there are a thousand and one things in </div>
<div id="tk_229" class="t s1_229">the world. And they study only at the end of the year. </div>
<div id="tl_229" class="t s1_229">"And now, because questions have become stereotyped, the same questions are </div>
<div id="tm_229" class="t s1_229">being repeated every year. Just read four years' question papers and that is </div>
<div id="tn_229" class="t s1_229">enough -- prepare for twenty questions and you are going to find five questions </div>
<div id="to_229" class="t s1_229">from those twenty in your examination. There is no need to bother about the </div>
<div id="tp_229" class="t s1_229">whole course because professors are lazy. Even to find a new question is difficult </div>
<div id="tq_229" class="t s1_229">for them, so they just look at four or five year-old examinations questions and </div>
<div id="tr_229" class="t s1_229">find questions -- maybe they rephrase them. That is their whole work. </div>
<div id="ts_229" class="t s1_229">"And in the market now examination keys -- which are a very profitable business </div>
<div id="tt_229" class="t s1_229">-- have appeared. Some retired professor knows perfectly well what is going to </div>
<div id="tu_229" class="t s1_229">come up in the examination. He takes ten years of questions in his book and </div>
<div id="tv_229" class="t s1_229">gives the answers to each point. You just purchase a key book. There is no need </div>
<div id="tw_229" class="t s1_229">to go into the originals because that is a difficult task. </div>
<div id="tx_229" class="t s1_229">"And if you give the answers, nobody bothers whether you know it or whether </div>
<div id="ty_229" class="t s1_229">you have crammed it. Those keys are made by retired professors in such a way </div>
<div id="tz_229" class="t s1_229">that the answer is very small and can be crammed, so no intelligence is needed. </div>
<div id="t10_229" class="t s1_229">"I was trying ...because I have not come to the college just to sit there. I am not </div>
<div id="t11_229" class="t s1_229">interested in degrees -- my interest is to sharpen my intelligence." </div>
<div id="t12_229" class="t s1_229">The principal said, "I can understand you, but still I will have to expel you. It is </div>
<div id="t13_229" class="t s1_229">unjust and I am feeling guilty because I cannot let that professor leave. Without </div>
<div id="t14_229" class="t s1_229">him, our whole logic department will collapse. He is the most senior professor </div>
<div id="t15_229" class="t s1_229">and he's a very stubborn man. If he has said that he will not come unless you are </div>
<div id="t16_229" class="t s1_229">expelled, he will not come. But knowing the injustice ...you have not been doing </div>
<div id="t17_229" class="t s1_229">anything harmful, you just don't have a teacher of a real caliber and genius. </div>
