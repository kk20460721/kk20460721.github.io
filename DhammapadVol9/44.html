<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">only one thing has happened to me which has made all the difference. I have become </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">aware and you are unaware. You are carrying the truth in you as much as I am. I am </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">aware of it; you are not aware of it. </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">"But remember, whether you know the truth or you don't know, it makes no difference </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">to the truth. The truth remains true. Knowing or not knowing does not make any </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">difference. Truth is truth. It is behind you," Buddha says, "it is in front of me. I have </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">turned in; I have taken the hundred-eighty-degree turn, that's all. It is not much to brag </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">about. You can do it." </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">This is again very special about Buddha. He never claims that he is unique; hence he is </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">of more help to humanity than anybody else. Because he says: I was just like you</div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">....</div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">MY </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">MIND USED TO WANDER WHEREVER PLEASURE OR DESIRE OR LUST LED IT. </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">He does not deny that there was lust in him from the very beginning. He does not deny </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">that there was desire, he does not say that he was born pure. He simply says, "I was as </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">much after pleasure -- I was as much full of desire as you are, and I was as much full of </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">lust as you are. So nothing is wrong in lust, in desire, in pleasure; if anything is wrong it </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">is in your unawareness. Be aware; and lust disappears, and desire disappears and the </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">constant greed for pleasure disappears." </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">When you become aware, you are so at ease, so full of bliss, who bothers about </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">pleasure? When you have diamonds who cares about pebbles? When you have </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">inexhaustible sources of inner bliss who goes on begging for small pleasures, ugly </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">pleasures? -- they simply disappear. </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">Buddha says: BUT NOW I HAVE IT TAMED, I have disciplined my mind, I have </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">meditated, I have gone into the functioning of the mind, I have seen it through and </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">through. Now I have become the master. Seeing it I have become the master. Knowing </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">it I have become the master. Understanding makes you the master. Now I GUIDE IT, </div>

<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">feel guilty for your anger, don't feel guilty for your lust. All that you need to do is </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">become aware of your greed, become aware of your lust, become aware of your desire, </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">and see the miracle happen. Just as you bring light in the room and darkness </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">disappears, exactly like that, precisely like that, as you bring awareness in all desire, all </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">greed, all anger, all lust simply disappears as if it has never been there. Don't try to </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">escape, don't try to renounce, because if you renounce you are simply renouncing the </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">opportunity. </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">A man escapes from his wife, goes to the Himalayas or moves to a monastery</div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">....</div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">There </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">are monasteries where no woman has been ever allowed in; there are monasteries </div>
<div id="t16_44" class="t s1_44">where once you go in, you are not allowed to go out again your whole life. Now, this is </div>
<div id="t17_44" class="t s1_44">not a transformation, this is simply escaping from the opportunity. </div>
<div id="t18_44" class="t s1_44">Dick brought Sally to his bed. "What would you like to do?" he asked. </div>
<div id="t19_44" class="t s1_44">"I would like to see today's newspaper," she said. </div>
