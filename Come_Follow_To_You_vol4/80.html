<div id="t1_80" class="t s1_80">And remember, this is the case with you, and with everybody. You can miss a </div>
<div id="t2_80" class="t s1_80">meditation just because in the morning you are feeling a little too lazy and too </div>
<div id="t3_80" class="t s1_80">sleepy. And who knows? -- that meditation could have been a conversion. </div>
<div id="t4_80" class="t s1_80">Nobody knows. You may have missed something, and you will never become </div>
<div id="t5_80" class="t s1_80">aware that you missed. Your sleep is really deep. You live an almost unconscious </div>
<div id="t6_80" class="t s1_80">life. </div>
<div id="t7_80" class="t s1_80">I will tell you one story I was reading. </div>
<div id="t8_80" class="t s1_80">A lion was captured and placed in a large yard surrounded by a high fence. He </div>
<div id="t9_80" class="t s1_80">soon became acquainted with the social life of the other lions who had been there </div>
<div id="ta_80" class="t s1_80">a long time. The lions had divided themselves into several clubs: political, </div>
<div id="tb_80" class="t s1_80">religious, and others, each with its own activities, philosophies, dogmas, </div>
<div id="tc_80" class="t s1_80">scriptures, ideologies. One group met regularly to hate and slander the captors, </div>
<div id="td_80" class="t s1_80">that was their whole activity -- as if just by hating and slandering the captors </div>
<div id="te_80" class="t s1_80">something was going to happen. Another group met to sing sentimentally about </div>
<div id="tf_80" class="t s1_80">a future jungle having no fences. They must have been utopian, imaginary </div>
<div id="tg_80" class="t s1_80">people who live in fantasy. They depicted a future jungle with no fences, in </div>
<div id="th_80" class="t s1_80">beautiful colors, and they sang about it in as beautiful poetry as possible. They </div>
<div id="ti_80" class="t s1_80">must have been very romantic, utopian, imaginary people. And a third group </div>
<div id="tj_80" class="t s1_80">met to secretly plan violence against the other groups, to plot violence against </div>
<div id="tk_80" class="t s1_80">the other groups. Those were the conspirators; they were not so much against the </div>
<div id="tl_80" class="t s1_80">captors as they were against the other groups of lions. </div>
<div id="tm_80" class="t s1_80">Each club tried to pressure the newcomer into joining, but something held him </div>
<div id="tn_80" class="t s1_80">back. His hesitation was caused by observing one particular lion who kept to </div>
<div id="to_80" class="t s1_80">himself, and who seemed always to be in deep thought and meditation. And this </div>
<div id="tp_80" class="t s1_80">lion who used to be alone, a loner, attracted the newcomer. He had some quality </div>
<div id="tq_80" class="t s1_80">of magnetism around him: a certain power, a certain magic. The newcomer shyly </div>
<div id="tr_80" class="t s1_80">approached the solitary lion and requested an explanation of his apartness. The </div>
<div id="ts_80" class="t s1_80">very apartness must have given him a quality of charisma, a glow around him. </div>
<div id="tt_80" class="t s1_80">Because people who live in crowds lose their individuality and their charisma; </div>
<div id="tu_80" class="t s1_80">people who live alone always gather around them an aura of authority, of </div>
<div id="tv_80" class="t s1_80">majesty. This loner looked like a king. He had something of the imperial in him. </div>
<div id="tw_80" class="t s1_80">'Join nothing!' replied the lion, the meditator.'These foolish creatures do </div>
<div id="tx_80" class="t s1_80">everything but the necessary. I am doing what is essential, so one day I will be </div>
<div id="ty_80" class="t s1_80">out of here. You are welcome to all the facts I have uncovered.' </div>
<div id="tz_80" class="t s1_80">'But what is this necessary thing that you are doing?' asked the newcomer. </div>
<div id="t10_80" class="t s1_80">'Listen carefully,' said the loner, the meditator lion.'I am studying the nature of </div>
<div id="t11_80" class="t s1_80">the fence. That is the only essential thing to do in life: to understand the nature of </div>
<div id="t12_80" class="t s1_80">the fence.' </div>
<div id="t13_80" class="t s1_80">Where is your fence? Where are the walls of your prison? -- in your sleep, in your </div>
<div id="t14_80" class="t s1_80">unconsciousness, in your behavior like a robot's. That's what Jesus was trying to </div>
<div id="t15_80" class="t s1_80">show his disciples that night:'If you can be alert, you will be free.' Awareness is </div>
<div id="t16_80" class="t s1_80">freedom, sleepiness is bondage. But even on that last night, the night of </div>
<div id="t17_80" class="t s1_80">departure -- and these disciples will repent for centuries, and in their repentance </div>
