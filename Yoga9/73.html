<div id="t2_73" class="t s1_73">man. I have heard dogs talking to each other. </div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s1_73">When it becomes difficult even to love animals, then people start loving things -- a house, </div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s1_73">a car, a bike. And they become much too romantic about these things. </div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s1_73">I have seen a man, he used to live just in front of my house. He loved his scooter so much </div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s1_73">that I have seen him cleaning his scooter in almost? romantic way -- as if he is cleaning </div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s1_73">his woman. Looking from this side and that, and feeling so happy. And he would never </div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s1_73">use it because it may get dirty. He would go on his old bike. I told him many times, </div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s1_73">"What are you doing? You have got a beautiful scooter.' He would say, "It is, but there is </div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s1_73">a possibility of rains coming. You see? Clouds are there." Or even it is too hot and his </div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s1_73">scooter may lose its shininess. No, I have never seen him using it. He simply cleans it, </div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s1_73">cares for it. The scooter is the beloved. </div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s1_73">This is a degradation of human consciousness. The more attached you become, the more </div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s1_73">degraded you become; the less the attachment, the higher you rise, soar. </div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s1_73">And there comes a moment Patanjali is talking about when spiritual powers happen to </div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s1_73">you. Remember, don't get attached to them, because they are really beautiful, very </div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s1_73">fulfilling. You would like to possess them. Many people become interested in yoga not </div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s1_73">because of yoga, not because of kaivalya, liberation, but only because of vibhutis, </div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s1_73">siddhis. They study yoga, they go to the Masters -- they want to do miracles. </div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s1_73">"By being nonattached to even these powers, the seed of bondage is destroyed." This is </div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s1_73">the last possibility of getting caught in bondage again. If you can cross this, the seed is </div>

<div id="tq_73" class="t s1_73">But one has to be alert on each step. The mind is cunning. And you may be thinking, </div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s1_73">"Yes, when miracles come I am not going to be attached to them." Think again. You will </div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s1_73">find in yourself somewhere a desire working, "Let them come, then we will see. First kt </div>

<div id="tu_73" class="t s1_73">Just to be liberated, free? What is the point in it? </div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s1_73">People come to me and they say, "What are we going to get out of meditation?" I say, </div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s1_73">"More meditation." They say, "But what is the point? Peace? Peace is okay, but what real </div>

<div id="ty_73" class="t s1_73">Peace doesn't look like a goal. Power -- something that you can do with, something </div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s1_73">through which you can prove. </div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s1_73">I have heard an anecdote, a very beautiful one. </div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s1_73">"Tell me, where do you Catholics get all the money to build cathedrals?" asked a rabbi to </div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s1_73">his friend. </div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s1_73">"Well, Abe, you see, we Catholics have a system called Confession. Whenever anybody </div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s1_73">does something wrong, he comes to church, confesses his sin, puts a little in the kitty, and </div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s1_73">is forgiven; and in this way we can collect large amounts of cash." </div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s1_73">"Really, what a wonderful system. Maybe we could adopt it for use in our synagogue. </div>
<div id="t17_73" class="t s1_73">But let me go along with you tonight so I could get a for instance of how you work." </div>
<div id="t18_73" class="t s1_73">"Well, Abe, it is strictly forbidden for me, as a priest, to have you along, but seeing as </div>
<div id="t19_73" class="t s1_73">how you have been such a good friend all these years, I will permit it just this once." </div>
