<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">I can understand your difficulty, Sarjano. It is very difficult to keep silent when you </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">know the answer, but part of being a bodhisattva is to learn the art of being silent. Let </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">them ask again and again. Let them feel that your bliss is not just something crazy, that </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">your bliss is something real, authentic. Let them feel it of their own accord. Let them </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">come and knock at your doors again and again. </div>

<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">Many try, very few succeed. Whosoever attains truth is bound to have the temptation to </div>

<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">and he will be thought just crazy. Communication is a difficult art, and communicating </div>
