<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">intelligent, clever." </div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">Keshav Chandra Sen started feeling very embarrassed. A crowd had gathered seeing </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">that Keshav Chandra, a great philosopher, is going to Ramakrishna; many people had </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">come to listen, hearing that something is going to transpire there. Even they started </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">feeling that the whole journey had been futile. "This is a strange thing that is </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">happening!" </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">And Ramakrishna danced and laughed and he said, "Even if there had been any doubt </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">in my mind about God, you have destroyed it. How can there be such intelligence </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">without God? You are proof, Keshav Chandra -- I believe in you." </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">And Keshav Chandra has written in his memoirs, "Ramakrishna's laughter defeated me </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">-- defeated me forever. I forgot all arguments. It looked so foolish! And he had not </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">argued against me, he had not even said a single word against me. He simply kissed </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">me, hugged me, laughed, danced. He appreciated me as nobody has ever appreciated -- </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">and I was talking against him! He said, 'Keshav Chandra, your presence, such </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">intelligence, such genius, is enough proof that God is!' He said this to me," Keshav </div>

<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">Ramakrishna possible?" </div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">The uneducated Ramakrishna, the villager Ramakrishna, proved far more profound </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">than the very sophisticated, educated Keshav Chandra. What happened? Something </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">tremendously beautiful happened. Ramakrishna is really religious; he knows what </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">religion is, he knows what godliness is: to take life in a dancing way, to take life singing, </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">to accept life in all its manifoldness, without any judgment -- to love it for what it is. </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">A sannyasin means one who is not trying to solve the mystery of life but is diving deep </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">into the mystery itself. Living the mystery is sannyas, not solving the mystery. If you </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">start solving it you become serious. If you start living it you become more and more </div>

<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">qualitative difference. It is not initiation in the old sense, just as it is not a learning in the </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">old sense -- it is an unlearning, and so I can say it is UNinitiation. It will bring you out </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">of all your initiations, because if you have been to so many schools and sects and </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">ideologies, many things must be still hanging around inside you. You need a good </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">cleaning, you need a thorough cleaning, you need a good bath -- and sannyas will give </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">you a shower, it will cleanse your soul. It will give you back the innocence of a child, </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">the laughter of a child, the eyes full of wonder and awe. </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">Don't hesitate... take the jump. It is a jump, because you cannot come to it through </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">thinking. It is a jump because it is not a conclusion of your mind. To others it will look </div>
<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">like madness -- in fact all love is mad and all love is blind, at least to those who don't </div>
<div id="t14_120" class="t s1_120">know what love is. To UNlovers love is blind; to lovers love is the only possible eye </div>
