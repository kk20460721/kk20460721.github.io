<div id="t1_7" class="t s1_7">you assert so silently that even your mind will not be able to hear it. There, the </div>
<div id="t2_7" class="t s1_7">Word has to be carried. </div>
<div id="t3_7" class="t s1_7">IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD, </div>
<div id="t4_7" class="t s1_7">AND THE WORD WAS GOD. </div>
<div id="t5_7" class="t s1_7">There is no difference between God and His name. He has no name; He himself </div>
<div id="t6_7" class="t s1_7">is His name. His `is-ness' is His name; His existence is His name. A child is born. </div>
<div id="t7_7" class="t s1_7">What name does he have? -- no name. But he is. That `is-ness' is his name. Then, </div>
<div id="t8_7" class="t s1_7">for utilitarian purposes, we give a name to him and by and by he will forget his </div>
<div id="t9_7" class="t s1_7">`is-ness' and he will become identified with the name. If somebody insults the </div>
<div id="ta_7" class="t s1_7">name, he will be angry; if somebody praises the name, he will be very happy. </div>
<div id="tb_7" class="t s1_7">And the name never belonged to him! </div>
<div id="tc_7" class="t s1_7">God is the child, always the child, always the innocence of the world. He has no </div>
<div id="td_7" class="t s1_7">name. That is the meaning of this saying: AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD. </div>
<div id="te_7" class="t s1_7">`Is-ness', existence, being: AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD. His name is His </div>
<div id="tf_7" class="t s1_7">being. Don't repeat His name, move into His being -- that is the only way to </div>
<div id="tg_7" class="t s1_7">attain Him. In fact, forget about Him. Move into your own being and `is-ness', </div>
<div id="th_7" class="t s1_7">and you will attain to Him. </div>
<div id="ti_7" class="t s1_7">ALL THINGS WERE MADE BY HIM; AND WITHOUT HIM WAS NOT </div>
<div id="tj_7" class="t s1_7">ANYTHING MADE THAT WAS MADE. </div>
<div id="tk_7" class="t s1_7">God is creativity. To say that God is the Creator is already to falsify Him, but to </div>
<div id="tl_7" class="t s1_7">say, "God is creativity," will not be understandable. Then people will think: then </div>
<div id="tm_7" class="t s1_7">why use 'God'? </div>
<div id="tn_7" class="t s1_7">-- just `creativity' will do. We say, "God is the Creator," but </div>
<div id="to_7" class="t s1_7">because of this expression much nonsense arises. Then when did He create the </div>
<div id="tp_7" class="t s1_7">world? Then why didn't He create it before? Why couldn't He create it before, </div>
<div id="tq_7" class="t s1_7">why did He create it at the time He created it? Why has He created it the way it </div>
<div id="tr_7" class="t s1_7">is? Why can't He improve it? </div>
<div id="ts_7" class="t s1_7">So much misery, so much suffering in the world, and He is the Creator. Then </div>
<div id="tt_7" class="t s1_7">God becomes the culprit. Then we feel angry: if He is the Creator then He is </div>
<div id="tu_7" class="t s1_7">responsible for all. Why can't He change it? Then all sorts of problems arise, and </div>
<div id="tv_7" class="t s1_7">theologians go on answering these questions. </div>
<div id="tw_7" class="t s1_7">In the first place, they need not arise if you look at the thing directly. God is not </div>
<div id="tx_7" class="t s1_7">the Creator, He is creativity. Creativity is His being. He has always been creating; </div>
<div id="ty_7" class="t s1_7">He cannot be on a holiday from His creativity. That is not possible; you cannot </div>
<div id="tz_7" class="t s1_7">go on a holiday from your innermost nature -- no. Whatsoever you can leave is </div>
<div id="t10_7" class="t s1_7">not your nature; that which you CANNOT leave is your nature. </div>
<div id="t11_7" class="t s1_7">God's nature is creativity. He has always been creating. And there is no other </div>
<div id="t12_7" class="t s1_7">way: the only way the world can exist is how it exists. It is the only way. </div>
<div id="t13_7" class="t s1_7">Whatsoever you think or condemn or appreciate is meaningless. It is like going </div>
<div id="t14_7" class="t s1_7">to a rose and asking, "Why do you only have so many petals? A few more could </div>
<div id="t15_7" class="t s1_7">be there. What was wrong? " But if a few more were there, the same question </div>
<div id="t16_7" class="t s1_7">would have again been relevant. </div>
