<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">CHAPTER 7. BECOME A MIRROR</div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s2_64">I have heard: A Chinese man once went to the court of the emperor of Iran and said, ”I have come</div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s2_64">from China, and I am a very great artist. I can make paintings such as you have never seen before.”</div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s2_64">The emperor said, ”Then make them here. But remember, there is no shortage of painters in our</div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s2_64">court and I have seen very wonderful pictures.”</div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s2_64">The Chinese painter said, ”I am ready to meet any challenge.”</div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s2_64">The best among the court painters was selected to compete. Then the emperor warned his painter,</div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s2_64">”Use all your talent, do your very best. This is now a question of the prestige of the empire. See that</div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s2_64">you are not defeated by this foreigner.”</div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s2_64">They were given six months to complete their work.</div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s2_64">The Iranian painter began his work very</div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s2_64">seriously. With the help of ten to twenty co-workers he covered his whole wall with beautiful pictures.</div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s2_64">News of his paintings reached distant regions, and people came from afar to see his work. But a</div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s2_64">greater miracle than this was happening. The Chinese artist said, ”I need no implements or materials</div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s2_64">for my work, nor any paints either. I insist on one condition only – that the curtain covering my wall</div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s2_64">not be removed till the picture is ﬁnished.”</div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s2_64">Each morning he would go behind his curtain, and reappear in the evening quite exhausted, with</div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s2_64">drops of perspiration on his forehead. But it was a matter of great perplexity, mystery and wonder</div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s2_64">that he did not carry any brush or paints with him when he disappeared behind the curtain. Neither</div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s2_64">were there ever any traces of color on his hands, nor any spots of paint on his clothes, and he carried</div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s2_64">no brush in his hands. The emperor began to wonder whether he was crazy. How could there be</div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s2_64">any competition under such circumstances? But it was necessary to wait for six months to fulﬁll the</div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s2_64">condition.</div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s2_64">With great impatience everyone waited for the six months to pass.</div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s2_64">The news about the pictures</div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s2_64">of the Iranian painter reached far and wide, and along with this news, the word also spread about</div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s2_64">his crazy competitor who had entered the competition without any paints. You can’t imagine how</div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s2_64">eagerly the people waited for those six months to pass.</div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s2_64">After six months the emperor went to see the pictures. He was spellbound on seeing the pictures of</div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s2_64">the Iranian painter. He had seen many paintings in his life, but he had never seen paintings of such</div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s2_64">unsparing skill. Then he requested the Chinese painter to show his work. He removed the curtain</div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s2_64">covering his wall. On seeing it the emperor was very much puzzled. It was the same picture. The</div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s2_64">Chinese painter had created the same picture as the Iranian, but with one additional feature: it was</div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s2_64">not painted on the wall, but emerged from twenty feet deep inside the wall. The emperor asked,</div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s2_64">”How have you done this? What is this magic?”</div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s2_64">He replied, ”I have done no magic. But I am an expert in making mirrors, so I turned the wall into a</div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s2_64">mirror by rubbing it continuously for six months. The picture which you are looking at is that of the</div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s2_64">Iranian painter’s on the opposite wall. I simply turned the wall into a mirror.”</div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s2_64">He won the competition, because shimmering in the mirror the Iranian painting became inﬁnitely</div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s2_64">more profound than its original. The Iranian painting acquired great depth when seen in the mirror.</div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s2_64">It became a three-dimensional picture. The Iranian one was two-dimensional; it had no depth. The</div>
<div id="t16_64" class="t s2_64">The Heartbeat of the Absolute</div>
<div id="t17_64" class="t s2_64">64</div>
<div id="t18_64" class="t s3_64">Osho</div>
