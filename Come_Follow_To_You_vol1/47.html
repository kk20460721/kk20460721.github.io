<div id="t1_47" class="t s1_47">In the last days of his life, before he was beheaded, he sent a note to Jesus, just a </div>
<div id="t2_47" class="t s1_47">small note asking: "Are you really the one for whom we were waiting? " He </div>
<div id="t3_47" class="t s1_47">became suspicious because this man was saying something else, something </div>
<div id="t4_47" class="t s1_47">absolutely different. "Be humble," this man was saying. "Blessed are the humble </div>
<div id="t5_47" class="t s1_47">because they shall inherit the earth." John was not a humble man, he was really </div>
<div id="t6_47" class="t s1_47">very proud -- a very strong man, believing that he could bring revolution to the </div>
<div id="t7_47" class="t s1_47">whole world, almost mad with his strength -- and Jesus was saying, "Blessed are </div>
<div id="t8_47" class="t s1_47">the poor</div>
<div id="t9_47" class="t s1_47">....</div>
<div id="ta_47" class="t s1_47">" John must have thought: what nonsense is this man talking about? </div>
<div id="tb_47" class="t s1_47">Jesus was saying, "If somebody slaps you on one side of the face, give him the </div>
<div id="tc_47" class="t s1_47">other side also" -- absolutely unlike John. And Jesus was saying: "If somebody </div>
<div id="td_47" class="t s1_47">snatches your coat, give him your shirt also." How is this man going to bring </div>
<div id="te_47" class="t s1_47">revolution? These are not revolutionary teachings. </div>
<div id="tf_47" class="t s1_47">These are the ONLY revolutionary teachings. But John could not understand </div>
<div id="tg_47" class="t s1_47">them; he had his own idea of a revolution. He could have understood Lenin, he </div>
<div id="th_47" class="t s1_47">could have understood Trotsky, he could have understood Marx, but he could </div>
<div id="ti_47" class="t s1_47">not understand Jesus, his own disciple. The problem was of a totally different </div>
<div id="tj_47" class="t s1_47">kind of revolution. One revolution is social: it is brought by violence, aggression; </div>
<div id="tk_47" class="t s1_47">it is, in a way, forced. Another revolution is of the heart: it is not brought by </div>
<div id="tl_47" class="t s1_47">force, not even by discipline. It comes by spontaneity, it comes by understanding. </div>
<div id="tm_47" class="t s1_47">Jesus was bringing a totally new kind of revolution to the world. Nobody had </div>
<div id="tn_47" class="t s1_47">talked about that revolution before. That's why I say that Jesus is the turning </div>
<div id="to_47" class="t s1_47">point in the history of human consciousness -- even more than Buddha. There </div>
<div id="tp_47" class="t s1_47">had been many others like Buddha, talking along the same lines; he was not new. </div>
<div id="tq_47" class="t s1_47">He may have been the end of a long procession of Buddhas, but he was not the </div>
<div id="tr_47" class="t s1_47">first. </div>
<div id="ts_47" class="t s1_47">Jesus brought something totally new to the earth; he was the beginning of a new </div>
<div id="tt_47" class="t s1_47">line, of a new search, of a new inquiry. John could not understand. Lao Tzu, if he </div>
<div id="tu_47" class="t s1_47">had been there, would have understood -- but not John. John was a totally </div>
<div id="tv_47" class="t s1_47">different type of man. In his last days he was very worried that something had </div>
<div id="tw_47" class="t s1_47">gone wrong: "Has this disciple betrayed me or what? " He sent a note: "Are you </div>
<div id="tx_47" class="t s1_47">the one we were waiting for? " When you have a fixed idea of a certain thing, </div>
<div id="ty_47" class="t s1_47">that becomes a barrier to understanding. What to say of the others? -- even John </div>
<div id="tz_47" class="t s1_47">could not understand Jesus perfectly. </div>
<div id="t10_47" class="t s1_47">I have heard one story: There was a very rich merchant who used to go all </div>
<div id="t11_47" class="t s1_47">around the world to collect silk, spices, perfume. In these three things he was one </div>
<div id="t12_47" class="t s1_47">of the most perfect merchants: he knew where to get them at a low price, from </div>
<div id="t13_47" class="t s1_47">what markets of the world, and where to sell them and profit much. And he had </div>
<div id="t14_47" class="t s1_47">profited much. That was his only interest: to find out more and more about </div>
<div id="t15_47" class="t s1_47">perfumes and spices. </div>
<div id="t16_47" class="t s1_47">One day, passing through a town. somebody told him that a very wise man lived </div>
<div id="t17_47" class="t s1_47">there. "Whatsoever your inquiry, he is always helpful." </div>
