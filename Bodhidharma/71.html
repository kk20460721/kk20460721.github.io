<div id="t2_71" class="t s1_71">You have seen people die; have you ever seen yourself dying? And when you see </div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s1_71">somebody dying, are you really seeing somebody dying? All that you are seeing, </div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s1_71">and all that your medical science can see is that the man has stopped breathing, </div>
<div id="t5_71" class="t s1_71">that his pulse has disappeared, that his heart beats no more, and they declare </div>
<div id="t6_71" class="t s1_71">that he is dead. </div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s1_71">Just a few days ago, a man in the part of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan, for the </div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s1_71">third time deceived his friends, his colleagues, his family. At the age of one </div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s1_71">hundred and thirty-five, he died for the third time. People were very suspicious </div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s1_71">because two times before he had played the trick; he died. Diagnosed by the </div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s1_71">doctors as dead, certified as dead, he woke up, opened his eyes and started </div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s1_71">laughing. So when he died this time, people were very cautious. Doctors were </div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">very cautious, but there was every certainty of his death; there was no question. </div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">They said, "Perhaps before he may have deceived you, but this time he is </div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s1_71">certainly dead. As far as medical science can know, he fulfills every requirement </div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s1_71">of a dead man." And the moment the certificate was signed by three doctors, the </div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">man opened his eyes, started laughing and said, "Listen, next time when I am </div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s1_71">going to die, I am going to REALLY die. I just thought one time more </div>

<div id="tl_71" class="t s1_71">That part of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan has the longest living people in India </div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">and Pakistan. One hundred and twenty is very ordinary, normal. One hundred </div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">and fifty you can find; it is not so normal, but still there are hundreds of people </div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">who have passed one hundred and fifty. And there are a few rare cases who </div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s1_71">have reached one hundred and eighty years of age and they are still young; they </div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s1_71">are still working in their fields. </div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">And this man has been questioned by newspapers, by journalists from all over </div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">the world, because he is a rare man; three times certified dead and three times he </div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">has defied all medical knowledge, all medical science. And they asked, "What </div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s1_71">have you been doing? What happens?" </div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s1_71">He said, "Nothing -- because I am not my body. I know it; and I am not my </div>

<div id="tx_71" class="t s1_71">simply slip into the beyond. The heart stops, the pulse stops, the breathing stops, </div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s1_71">and you are all befooled. Then I slip back again into the body, the blood starts </div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s1_71">running again, the pulse starts working again and the heart starts beating again." </div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s1_71">He is a simple man, a farmer. He is not a yogi; he has never practiced anything. </div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s1_71">But just when he was a very young child, not more than seven or eight years old, </div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s1_71">he came in contact with a Sufi mystic who told him that death is an illusion. And </div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s1_71">he was so innocent that he accepted it. </div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s1_71">The Sufi mystic said to him, "There is a very simple way to slip out of your body. </div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s1_71">Just watch it from inside; watch the body and suddenly there will come more </div>
<div id="t16_71" class="t s1_71">and more distance between you and your body. Soon the body will be miles </div>
<div id="t17_71" class="t s1_71">away. Watch the mind and the same will happen with the mind. </div>
<div id="t18_71" class="t s1_71">"You simply remain a watcher and you will be able to slip out of the body, out of </div>
<div id="t19_71" class="t s1_71">the mind, out of this whole personality. And it is within your control to come </div>
