<div id="t4_132" class="t s1_132">become "simple" -- you can leave the house and clothes and become naked; but </div>
<div id="t5_132" class="t s1_132">in your nakedness there will be complexity, there cannot be simplicity. Simplicity </div>
<div id="t6_132" class="t s1_132">comes only as a shadow of contentment; then you can live in a palace and you </div>
<div id="t7_132" class="t s1_132">can be simple. Simplicity has nothing to do with what you have: simplicity has </div>
<div id="t8_132" class="t s1_132">something to do with the quality of the mind. </div>

<div id="tc_132" class="t s1_132">the creator? He will not be able. He is playing a game with himself: nobody else </div>
<div id="td_132" class="t s1_132">is deceived. </div>
<div id="te_132" class="t s1_132">Austerity is simplicity: to live a simple life. What is a simple life? It is like that of </div>
<div id="tf_132" class="t s1_132">a child -- you enjoy everything, but you don't cling. </div>
<div id="tg_132" class="t s1_132">It happened: One of the greatest saints of India was Kabir. He had a son; his </div>
<div id="th_132" class="t s1_132">name was Kamal. He was an even greater man than the father, but nobody </div>
<div id="ti_132" class="t s1_132">knows about Kamal much because he was really a very, very rare being. Many </div>
<div id="tj_132" class="t s1_132">disciples were there, and much competition, as it happens with disciples. And </div>
<div id="tk_132" class="t s1_132">many people were against Kamal living with Kabir because, they said, "This man </div>
<div id="tl_132" class="t s1_132">is blameworthy." People would bring many gifts, donations, money, diamonds </div>
<div id="tm_132" class="t s1_132">to Kabir's feet -- he would never take them. And Kamal would be sitting outside, </div>
<div id="tn_132" class="t s1_132">and when they would come back, if they offered, he would take them. So people </div>
<div id="to_132" class="t s1_132">said. "Your son is greedy." </div>
<div id="tp_132" class="t s1_132">Kabir knew him well, that he was not greedy at all; he was a very simple man. </div>
<div id="tq_132" class="t s1_132">That's why he used to call him Kamal. Kamal means "a miracle." He was a man </div>
<div id="tr_132" class="t s1_132">who was really a miracle, and it has to be so: bound to Kabir he had to be a </div>
<div id="ts_132" class="t s1_132">miracle-man. But he was really simple -- just like a child. Sometimes he would </div>
<div id="tt_132" class="t s1_132">even ask: somebody's gift has been refused, Kabir has refused it -- someone has </div>
<div id="tu_132" class="t s1_132">brought diamonds to give him and Kabir has refused them -- and the man will be </div>
<div id="tv_132" class="t s1_132">taking them away and Kamal will say. "Beautiful stones. Where are you taking </div>
<div id="tw_132" class="t s1_132">them? Bring them to me. If my father cannot accept, I can accept." </div>
<div id="tx_132" class="t s1_132">This was bad. So, finally, disciples persuaded Kabir, against his wishes, and </div>
<div id="ty_132" class="t s1_132">Kabir said, "Okay, if you think... then I will throw him out." </div>
<div id="tz_132" class="t s1_132">Kamal was thrown out. He didn't say anything; he simply accepted: a man of </div>
<div id="t10_132" class="t s1_132">contentment. He did not even argue that people who are complaining against </div>
<div id="t11_132" class="t s1_132">him are wrong. no. There is no argument in such a man. He simply left, he made </div>
<div id="t12_132" class="t s1_132">a small hut just alongside of Kabir, and started living there. Thousands of people </div>
<div id="t13_132" class="t s1_132">would come to Kabir, and nobody would come to Kamal, because he was not </div>
<div id="t14_132" class="t s1_132">known at all; and this was known all over. that Kabir has thrown him out, so this </div>
<div id="t15_132" class="t s1_132">was enough condemnation. </div>
<div id="t16_132" class="t s1_132">The king of Kashi, who was a devotee of Kabir, once came. and he asked, "Where </div>
<div id="t17_132" class="t s1_132">is Kamal?" Kabir had to tell the story. The king said, "But I have never felt that </div>
