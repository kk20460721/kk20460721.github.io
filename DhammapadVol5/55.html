<div id="t1_55" class="t s1_55">And you say, "In my own life I have been blessed with encountering a few rare and </div>
<div id="t2_55" class="t s1_55">wise psychiatrists, psychologists -- one of whom led me to you." </div>
<div id="t3_55" class="t s1_55">You may have -- there are a few people who are really intelligent, knowledgeable. But </div>
<div id="t4_55" class="t s1_55">you don't understand the meaning of the word 'wisdom'. It is impossible to find a wise </div>
<div id="t5_55" class="t s1_55">psychoanalyst; if he were wise he would have already become a sannyasin, he would </div>
<div id="t6_55" class="t s1_55">not be a psychoanalyst any longer. And they can be of great help; and particularly in </div>
<div id="t7_55" class="t s1_55">the West where masters don't exist, a psychoanalyst is the only possibility of gaining </div>
<div id="t8_55" class="t s1_55">any help, a pure substitute for a master -- because the master means one who is </div>
<div id="t9_55" class="t s1_55">enlightened, one who has arrived, one who no longer has any problems to solve, any </div>
<div id="ta_55" class="t s1_55">desires to be fulfilled -- one who is already fulfilled. </div>
<div id="tb_55" class="t s1_55">It is very difficult to find a master in the West. The next best is the psychiatrist, the </div>
<div id="tc_55" class="t s1_55">psychoanalyst. But remember, he is only the next best. And when I say it is difficult to </div>
<div id="td_55" class="t s1_55">find masters in the West I mean that the Western tradition has fallen into the hands of </div>
<div id="te_55" class="t s1_55">the priests. For two thousand years the priests have not allowed masters to survive, to </div>
<div id="tf_55" class="t s1_55">exist; or even if, in spite of them, a person became enlightened, he had to go into hiding. </div>
<div id="tg_55" class="t s1_55">He could not declare his enlightenment, he could not share his enlightenment, or he </div>
<div id="th_55" class="t s1_55">had to share it in such a way that the priests didn't become aware of what he was doing. </div>
<div id="ti_55" class="t s1_55">So two things Western enlightened people have been doing: one was pretending to be </div>
<div id="tj_55" class="t s1_55">part of the church, using the language of the church and pouring their enlightenment </div>
<div id="tk_55" class="t s1_55">into it, because that was one of the ways not to get into conflict with the church and the </div>
<div id="tl_55" class="t s1_55">state; that's what was done by Meister Eckhart, Saint Francis, Jacob Bohme and others. </div>
<div id="tm_55" class="t s1_55">They remained part of the church. It was just a device to survive and to share </div>
<div id="tn_55" class="t s1_55">something. And they used the language of the church which is very unfitting. They </div>
<div id="to_55" class="t s1_55">could not be so free as Zen masters or Sufi masters; they could not express themselves </div>
<div id="tp_55" class="t s1_55">totally; they had to force their experience into Christian jargon, which was dull, dead. </div>
<div id="tq_55" class="t s1_55">Or those who were not ready to compromise had to go into hiding, they had to go </div>
<div id="tr_55" class="t s1_55">underground; that's how alchemy was born. Alchemists were not chemists; alchemists </div>
<div id="ts_55" class="t s1_55">were not really trying to transform base metals into gold, that was just a device to hide </div>
<div id="tt_55" class="t s1_55">behind. </div>
<div id="tu_55" class="t s1_55">The alchemists were real masters but they pretended to be alchemists, and if you had </div>
<div id="tv_55" class="t s1_55">seen them from the outside you would have seen them concerned with base metals and </div>
<div id="tw_55" class="t s1_55">gold and silver. And many experiments were going on, but deep inside the real </div>
<div id="tx_55" class="t s1_55">experiment was going on. Transforming unconsciousness into consciousness -- that is </div>
<div id="ty_55" class="t s1_55">the real transformation of base metal into gold. Gold represents consciousness, </div>
<div id="tz_55" class="t s1_55">enlightenment. </div>
<div id="t10_55" class="t s1_55">So this happened in the West. The priests were so powerful and the priests were in such </div>
<div id="t11_55" class="t s1_55">a conspiracy with the state that either they burned people like Joan of Arc, who was a </div>
<div id="t12_55" class="t s1_55">mystic -- they killed many mystics -- or forced mystics to go underground, or forced </div>
<div id="t13_55" class="t s1_55">them to speak the language of the church. </div>
<div id="t14_55" class="t s1_55">Hence in the West masters almost disappeared, and now from the East, particularly </div>
<div id="t15_55" class="t s1_55">from India, there are many many so-called masters roaming all over the West -- Mahesh </div>
<div id="t16_55" class="t s1_55">Yogi, Muktananda, etcetera, etcetera. I call them "etceteranandas." These are all pseudo </div>
<div id="t17_55" class="t s1_55">people, because a master waits for the disciple to come to him; there is no need for the </div>
