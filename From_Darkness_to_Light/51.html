<div id="t1_51" class="t s1_51">CHAPTER 4. THE DEATH PENALTY: NOT PUNISHMENT BUT REVENGE</div>
<div id="t2_51" class="t s2_51">stumbled upon the treasure. The treasure was so vast that one of the two was not willing to divide</div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s2_51">it. The only way was to kill the other, but in killing the other he might get caught. There was danger,</div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s2_51">and now he could not take any risk because the whole treasure was in his hands.</div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s2_51">He managed a very cunning way. He disappeared and spread the rumor that he had been murdered,</div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s2_51">and he left all the evidence that would prove that his friend was the murderer. The friend was caught</div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s2_51">with all the proofs: his revolver was there; two bullets were missing, and his ﬁngerprints were on</div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s2_51">the revolver. His handkerchief with his name embroidered on it had fallen</div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s2_51">....</div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s2_51">And only he knew the</div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s2_51">place where the friend was hiding in the jungles against the police, because they had done other</div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s2_51">crimes also, and there was a price on both of them to be caught alive or dead.</div>
<div id="td_51" class="t s2_51">He could not prove his innocence; there was no way – everything went against him. He was given</div>
<div id="te_51" class="t s2_51">the death penalty. He knew he had not murdered his friend; he knew that this whole thing was a</div>
<div id="tf_51" class="t s2_51">plot. His friend was not dead; it was just to keep the whole treasure, that the friend had removed</div>
<div id="tg_51" class="t s2_51">him in a legal way, out of the way.</div>
<div id="th_51" class="t s2_51">But he escaped from the prison before he was executed. After twelve years he came into the court,</div>
<div id="ti_51" class="t s2_51">dragging the dead body of a very famous politician, a rich man of the city, and he told the court – it</div>
<div id="tj_51" class="t s2_51">was the same judge – ”I have murdered this man, and I dare you to punish me. But ﬁrst let me tell</div>
<div id="tk_51" class="t s2_51">you the whole story. I am the man who twelve years ago you had sentenced to death. I escaped</div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s2_51">from the prison because I was absolutely innocent, but I had no proof.”</div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s2_51">In fact innocence has never any proof. Proofs are for the crime or against the crime, but innocence</div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s2_51">has no proof.</div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s2_51">He said, ”Now I have murdered the man you charged me twelve years ago for having murdered</div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s2_51">– this is the man. If your ﬁrst judgment was right then you cannot punish me again for the same</div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s2_51">murder because that man was murdered twelve years ago. And if your ﬁrst judgment was not right,</div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s2_51">how can you be sure that your second judgment is going to be right?”</div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s2_51">Can you punish a man for murdering the same man twice?</div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s2_51">It is really very difﬁcult to decide.</div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s2_51">He said, ”The only crime I have committed is escaping from the jail, but can you call it a crime?</div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s2_51">When you punish an innocent man with death, who is the criminal – you or me?</div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s2_51">”And this man plotted the whole thing; he managed all those proofs because he had my revolver,</div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s2_51">he had my handkerchief. He managed all those proofs, escaped from there with the treasure that</div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s2_51">we had both found, became a rich man, famous. He changed his name, his personality, shaved off</div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s2_51">his beard, changed his hair-do, and became respectable; he opened a hospital, a school, made a</div>
<div id="t10_51" class="t s2_51">temple. And this is the man who managed the plot to show he had been murdered.</div>
<div id="t11_51" class="t s2_51">”In that way he was saved from the punishment for other crimes for which the police were searching</div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s2_51">for him; now he has been murdered – so that ﬁle is closed. He killed two birds by one stone: he</div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s2_51">killed me, not directly, but through a legal procedure. He used all you idiots to kill me, so that he</div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s2_51">would become the whole owner of the treasure – and he did. By the same strategy he removed all</div>
<div id="t15_51" class="t s2_51">From Darkness to Light</div>
<div id="t16_51" class="t s2_51">51</div>
