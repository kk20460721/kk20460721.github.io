<div id="t1_129" class="t s1_129">The widow was tending to the plants around her husband's grave. As she bent over, </div>
<div id="t2_129" class="t s1_129">some blades of grass tickled the bare flesh under her skirt. Startled, she turned around </div>
<div id="t3_129" class="t s1_129">quickly, but there was no one in sight. Sighing, she turned back to the grave and </div>
<div id="t4_129" class="t s1_129">whispered, "Sam, behave yourself! And remember, you are supposed to be dead." </div>
<div id="t5_129" class="t s1_129">Neither in life nor in death is psychology going to help you much. You can be helped </div>
<div id="t6_129" class="t s1_129">only by religion. </div>
<div id="t7_129" class="t s1_129">Now the psychologist is trying to play the role of the master, which is utterly </div>
<div id="t8_129" class="t s1_129">pretentious. The psychologist, the psychoanalyst and the psychiatrist are not masters! </div>
<div id="t9_129" class="t s1_129">They don't know themselves. Yes, they have understood a little bit about the </div>
<div id="ta_129" class="t s1_129">mechanism of the mind, they have studied, they are well informed. But information </div>
<div id="tb_129" class="t s1_129">never changes anybody, it never brings any revolution. Deep down the person remains </div>
<div id="tc_129" class="t s1_129">the same. He can talk beautifully, he can give you good advice, but he cannot follow his </div>
<div id="td_129" class="t s1_129">own advice. </div>
<div id="te_129" class="t s1_129">The psychoanalyst cannot be the master. But in the West particularly he has become so </div>
<div id="tf_129" class="t s1_129">successful professionally that even the priest is in tremendous awe. Even the priests -- </div>
<div id="tg_129" class="t s1_129">the Catholic and the Protestant -- are studying psychoanalysis and other schools of </div>
<div id="th_129" class="t s1_129">psychology, because they see that people are not coming to the priest anymore, they are </div>
<div id="ti_129" class="t s1_129">going to the psychoanalyst. The priest is becoming afraid that he is losing his job. </div>
<div id="tj_129" class="t s1_129">The priest has dominated people for hundreds of years. He was the wise man -- he has </div>
<div id="tk_129" class="t s1_129">lost his attraction. And people cannot live without advisors; they need somebody to tell </div>
<div id="tl_129" class="t s1_129">them what to do because they never grow up. They are like small children, always in </div>
<div id="tm_129" class="t s1_129">need of being told what to do and what not to do. Up to now the priest used to do that; </div>
<div id="tn_129" class="t s1_129">now the priest has lost his charm, his validity. He is no longer contemporary, he has </div>
<div id="to_129" class="t s1_129">become out of date. Now the psychoanalyst has taken his place, HE is the priest now. </div>
<div id="tp_129" class="t s1_129">But as the priest was false, so is the psychoanalyst. The priest was using religious jargon </div>
<div id="tq_129" class="t s1_129">to exploit people; the psychologist is using scientific jargon to exploit the same people. </div>
<div id="tr_129" class="t s1_129">Neither was the priest awakened, nor is the psychoanalyst awakened. </div>
<div id="ts_129" class="t s1_129">Man can be helped only by somebody who is a buddha already; otherwise he cannot be </div>
<div id="tt_129" class="t s1_129">helped. </div>
<div id="tu_129" class="t s1_129">All your advisors will make more and more mess out of you. The more you listen to </div>
<div id="tv_129" class="t s1_129">advisors, the more you will become messed up -- because they don't know what they </div>
<div id="tw_129" class="t s1_129">are saying! They don't even agree amongst themselves. Freud says one thing, Adler </div>
<div id="tx_129" class="t s1_129">says another, Jung says still another. And now there are a thousand and one schools. </div>
<div id="ty_129" class="t s1_129">And every school is fanatical about its philosophy -- that it has the truth, the whole </div>
<div id="tz_129" class="t s1_129">truth and nothing but the truth. Not only does it say that it is true; it says it has THE </div>
<div id="t10_129" class="t s1_129">truth, and everybody else is lying, deceiving. </div>
<div id="t11_129" class="t s1_129">If you listen to these psychoanalysts, if you go from one psychoanalyst to another, you </div>
<div id="t12_129" class="t s1_129">will be more puzzled. The only help that they can give to you is that if you are </div>
<div id="t13_129" class="t s1_129">intelligent enough you will become so fed up with them, so bored with them, that you </div>
<div id="t14_129" class="t s1_129">will simply drop the idea of being transformed, and you may start living your life </div>
<div id="t15_129" class="t s1_129">normally, without bothering much about transformation -- IF you are intelligent, which </div>
<div id="t16_129" class="t s1_129">is very rare, because intelligence is crushed from the very beginning. You are made </div>
