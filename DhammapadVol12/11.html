<div id="t2_11" class="t s1_11">but more sensitive -- sensitive to cold, sensitive to heat, sensitive to many things. </div>
<div id="t3_11" class="t s1_11">That is one of the causes of the constant conflict between men and women: because the </div>
<div id="t4_11" class="t s1_11">woman comes to orgasm very slowly; her sensitivity is much less. It takes a longer time </div>
<div id="t5_11" class="t s1_11">for her to come to an orgasm. Man comes quickly; his body is very sensitive. And the </div>
<div id="t6_11" class="t s1_11">gap between the man's body and the woman's body creates a great problem. Unless the </div>
<div id="t7_11" class="t s1_11">man is very alert and takes every care to move slowly with the woman's body, the </div>
<div id="t8_11" class="t s1_11">woman will never be satisfied. </div>
<div id="t9_11" class="t s1_11">And her dissatisfaction will show in many ways: your tea will be cold, your vegetables </div>
<div id="ta_11" class="t s1_11">will have too much salt. The whole day, from the kitchen, such noises of breaking </div>
<div id="tb_11" class="t s1_11">things will come, as if you are living in an earthquake! Not that she is doing it </div>
<div id="tc_11" class="t s1_11">consciously, that too is absolutely unconscious -- nobody is a master, all are slaves -- but </div>
<div id="td_11" class="t s1_11">she is taking revenge in her own way. </div>
<div id="te_11" class="t s1_11">So whenever you want to make love to a woman, immediately she has a headache, she </div>
<div id="tf_11" class="t s1_11">is tired, she is no longer interested, for the simple reason that she never achieves the </div>
<div id="tg_11" class="t s1_11">orgasm. Why should she participate in a game in which she is always the loser? It is </div>
<div id="th_11" class="t s1_11">only recently that man is becoming aware of the difference; that difference can be </div>
<div id="ti_11" class="t s1_11">bridged, but skill is needed. </div>
<div id="tj_11" class="t s1_11">Just ask your wife to prick your back with a needle on many places, and you will be </div>
<div id="tk_11" class="t s1_11">surprised: there are a few places which are absolutely insensitive -- the prick will not be </div>
<div id="tl_11" class="t s1_11">felt at all -- and a few places where the prick will be felt. A few spots are blind. Those </div>
<div id="tm_11" class="t s1_11">people who are lying on a bed of thorns have simply arranged the whole thing in such a </div>

<div id="tr_11" class="t s1_11">eat once a day, then it eats too much. You can eat twice, you can eat thrice, then it </div>
<div id="ts_11" class="t s1_11">divides. You can eat five times... and, in fact, to eat five times is far more scientific than </div>
<div id="tt_11" class="t s1_11">to eat one time, because to eat one time means putting too much load on the system. It </div>
<div id="tu_11" class="t s1_11">is better to divide the load. And if man has really come down from the monkeys, look at </div>
<div id="tv_11" class="t s1_11">the monkeys -- they are eating the whole day! Americans are doing exactly that, so </div>
<div id="tw_11" class="t s1_11">whether Darwin is correct about anybody else or not, he is correct about the Americans! </div>
<div id="tx_11" class="t s1_11">You can eat one time a day; the body will adjust to that. These things are nothing to do </div>
<div id="ty_11" class="t s1_11">with spirituality, but these are the things that your so-called saints go on bragging </div>
<div id="tz_11" class="t s1_11">about. </div>
<div id="t10_11" class="t s1_11">A real master is not proud: HE DOES NOT TALK DOWN TO OTHERS. The real master </div>
<div id="t11_11" class="t s1_11">is one who has recognized that everybody has the same potential. How can he talk </div>

<div id="t13_11" class="t s1_11">Buddha has said that when he became enlightened, immediately he saw that the whole </div>
