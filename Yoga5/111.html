<div id="ta_111" class="t s1_111">who was too attached to money, it was a great thing to give all. </div>

<div id="tj_111" class="t s1_111">everything -- to be put in a bag and given to him; only then he starts the work. </div>
<div id="tk_111" class="t s1_111">The woman was afraid. She said, "I will think and tomorrow I will reply." Then </div>
<div id="tl_111" class="t s1_111">she heard about this musician woman. She went to her and asked, "What has </div>
<div id="tm_111" class="t s1_111">happened?" She told the whole story. Then she was very happy. She said, "Then </div>
