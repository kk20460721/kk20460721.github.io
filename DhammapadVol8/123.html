<div id="t4_123" class="t s1_123">freedom you are nobody, a nonentity, a nothingness. And who wants to be a </div>
<div id="t5_123" class="t s1_123">nothingness? Everybody wants to be somebody; even though one has to live in a prison, </div>
<div id="t6_123" class="t s1_123">one is ready</div>

<div id="ta_123" class="t s1_123">rather than be free and nobody. </div>
<div id="tb_123" class="t s1_123">The first requirement for attaining to truth is the capacity to be free, the capacity to be </div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s1_123">nobody. The ego is the greatest barrier. The ego can exist only in a golden bowl; it can't </div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s1_123">exist in a lake. It is bound to melt, merge and disappear. </div>
<div id="te_123" class="t s1_123">Lies are good for the ego. In fact, the ego is the greatest lie; it feeds on other lies. </div>
<div id="tf_123" class="t s1_123">Although truth has a way of coming up again and again... howsoever repressed, it </div>
<div id="tg_123" class="t s1_123">surfaces, because it is truth; you can repress it only for the time being. And to repress </div>
<div id="th_123" class="t s1_123">truth you will have to be constantly on guard. Of course you will get tired, you will </div>
<div id="ti_123" class="t s1_123">need a little rest, and whenever you are resting the truth surfaces. The truth comes in </div>
<div id="tj_123" class="t s1_123">your life again and again; you can go on denying it, but it never denies you. You can </div>
<div id="tk_123" class="t s1_123">deny God, but God never denies you. </div>
<div id="tl_123" class="t s1_123">Friedrich Nietzsche declared: There is no God. God is dead. But God has remained </div>
<div id="tm_123" class="t s1_123">silent. He didn't become annoyed; otherwise at least he would have shouted. </div>
<div id="tn_123" class="t s1_123">I have heard about one atheist, Diderot, who used to argue against God. He had a </div>
<div id="to_123" class="t s1_123">special argument. In front of the audience he would take his pocket watch and would </div>
<div id="tp_123" class="t s1_123">say that it is such a time -- eight thirty: "Now if there is a God and if you are almighty, </div>

<div id="tr_123" class="t s1_123">everywhere. And if you are really there, do only one thing: stop this watch, even for </div>
<div id="ts_123" class="t s1_123">five minutes, and that will be enough proof of your existence." </div>
<div id="tt_123" class="t s1_123">His whole life he used that argument. People would wait without breathing, that maybe </div>
<div id="tu_123" class="t s1_123">God is going to do something. But God never stopped his watch, not even once. </div>
<div id="tv_123" class="t s1_123">You can go on denying God, but God never denies you. You can go on refuting truth, </div>
<div id="tw_123" class="t s1_123">but truth never refutes you. Your denial does not become an irritation; your denial is </div>
<div id="tx_123" class="t s1_123">only a childish act. Truth goes on again and again visiting you; it never tires of you. </div>
<div id="ty_123" class="t s1_123">And if you watch your life, you will be surprised in how many ways it comes. </div>
