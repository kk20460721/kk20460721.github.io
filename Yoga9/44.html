<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">action. He sat quietly until she subsided, then pointed at her and shouted, "That is one!" </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">The couple lived happily for sixty years. </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">But that happiness cannot be real happiness. Easy to repress at the point of a gun, but </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">then what sort of love will happen between these two people? The gun will always stand </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">in between, and the wife will always be afraid now any moment he is going to say, "Now </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">this is two! Now this is three!" and finished. </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">That's what you have done with your senses, with your body. You have repressed it. But </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">you were helpless. I don't say that you are responsible for repressing it. You were brought </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">up in such a way, nobody allowed your senses freedom. In the name of love, only </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">repression continues. The mothers, the fathers, the society, they go on repressing. By and </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">by they teach you a trick, and the trick is not to accept yourself deny. Everything has to </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">be channelized into conformity. Your wilderness has to be thrown into the dark part of </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">your soul and a small corner has to be clean, like a drawing room, where you can see </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">people, meet people, and live and forget all about your wilder being, your real existence. </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">Your fathers and your mothers are not responsible either, because they were brought up </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">in the same way. </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">So nobody is responsible. But once you know it, and you don't do anything, then you </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">become responsible. Being near me I am going to make you very, very responsible, </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">because you will know it, and then if you don't do anything, then you cannot throw the </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">responsibility on anybody else. Then you are going to be responsible. </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">Now you know about how you have destroyed your senses and you know also how to </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">revive them. Do something. Throw the gun completely, the repressive mind completely. </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">Unblock yourself. Start flowing again. Start connecting again with your being. Start </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">connecting with your senses again. You are like a disconnected telephone-line. </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">Everything looks perfectly okay, the telephone is there, but the line is disconnected. Your </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">eyes are there, your hands are there, your ears are there, but the line is disconnected. </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">Reconnect it. If it can be disconnected, it can be reconnected. Others have disconnected it </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">because they were also taught in the same way, but you can reconnect it. </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">All my meditations are to give you a streaming energy. That's why I call them dynamic </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">methods. Old meditations were just to sit silently, not to do anything. I give you active </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">methods because when you are streaming with energy you can sit silently, that will do, </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">but right now first you have to become alive. </div>

<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">WITHOUT THE USE OF THE BODY, </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">AND COMPLETE MASTERY OVER PRADHANA (PRAKRITI), </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">THE MATERIAL WORLD. </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">If you can see tanmatras, the subtle energies of your senses, you will become-capable of </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">using your cognition without the grosser instruments. If you know that behind the eye </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">there is an accumulated pool of energy, you can close your eyes and use that energy </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">directly. Then you will be able to see without opening your eyes. That's what telepathy, </div>
<div id="t16_44" class="t s1_44">clairvoyance, clairaudience is. </div>
