<div id="t2_3" class="t s1_3">just to find the right opportunity for its expression, for its manifestation, for its </div>
<div id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">realization. </div>
<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">Buddha says: </div>
<div id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">A MAN IS NOT BORN TO MASTERY. </div>
<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">Every man is born as a slave. It hurts to know it; we would like to be told that we are </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">born as masters. We believe that we are masters -- nobody suspects it. The people who </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">start suspecting their mastery are the only people who are capable of becoming, some </div>
<div id="t9_3" class="t s1_3">day, masters. You doubt everything, but you never doubt your mastery over yourself, </div>
<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">and that is the most doubtful thing, the most doubtable thing. What kind of mastery </div>
<div id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">have you got? You are a slave, an utter slave of biological instincts, of sex, of anger, of </div>
<div id="tc_3" class="t s1_3">greed, of ambition. You stink of all these things, you are full of all these things. And still </div>
<div id="td_3" class="t s1_3">you go on believing deep down somewhere that you are masters. </div>
<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">And rather than making an effort to destroy this slavery you start proving your mastery </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">over others. You try to become Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan or Tamerlane. </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">That is an effort to deceive yourself. That is an effort to prove something which is not </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">there at all. You are trying to gather proofs about your mastery. Of course, if you </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">become powerful enough over many people you can believe more easily that you are a </div>
<div id="tj_3" class="t s1_3">master. It is easier for Alexander to believe that he is a master, but it is only a belief with </div>
<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">no foundation to it. He is as much a slave as anybody else; maybe he is a far bigger </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">slave than anybody else. </div>
<div id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">When he was coming to India, Alexander met a rare man, Diogenes. Had Diogenes </div>
<div id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">been born in India he would have been considered a buddha; he was one of the </div>

<div id="tp_3" class="t s1_3">naked by the side of a river. It was early morning when Alexander went to see him; he </div>
<div id="tq_3" class="t s1_3">was lying naked on the bank of the river taking a sunbath. Seeing the man, feeling his </div>
<div id="tr_3" class="t s1_3">presence, Alexander for the first time felt a kind of inferiority arising in him. He had </div>
<div id="ts_3" class="t s1_3">come across many kings, he had defeated many kings, but here was a real king -- a </div>
<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">master. </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">When you come across a master it is impossible not to feel the presence -- unless you </div>
<div id="tv_3" class="t s1_3">are absolutely blind, absolutely deaf, utterly dead. Alexander must have been a little </div>
<div id="tw_3" class="t s1_3">sensitive, a little alert, otherwise he would not have come to see this naked fakir. Just </div>
<div id="tx_3" class="t s1_3">the fact that he came to see him, out of the way, shows that he had some deep feeling </div>
<div id="ty_3" class="t s1_3">that all his possessions were not enough to make him contented: "There must be some </div>
<div id="tz_3" class="t s1_3">other way to be contented. Life cannot be only possessions and power; life must have </div>
<div id="t10_3" class="t s1_3">some more secrets to it." </div>
