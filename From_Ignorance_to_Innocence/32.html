<div id="t1_32" class="t s1_32">CHAPTER 3. THE NUCLEAR FAMILY – THE IMMINENT MELTDOWN</div>
<div id="t2_32" class="t s2_32">Trotsky was writing Joseph Stalin’s biography, which is one of the most profound biographies ever</div>
<div id="t3_32" class="t s2_32">written because he knew Stalin as nobody else knew him – Trotsky was the second topmost man</div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s2_32">in the revolution. Stalin was nowhere; he was somewhere around eleventh or twelfth. But Trotsky</div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s2_32">was alert that this man was dangerous... because he never spoke, he was always keeping quiet,</div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s2_32">everything about him was secret.</div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s2_32">His friends, who are his friends?</div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s2_32">His enemies, who are his</div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s2_32">enemies? Nothing was ever revealed. Trotsky was concerned about this man – he seemed to be a</div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s2_32">dangerous type. So he started collecting facts about him.</div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s2_32">And when Stalin started murdering, the procedure that was adopted was a beautiful conspiracy:</div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s2_32">Lenin was given daily poison in the name of medicine. The doctor was a hired man of Stalin. The</div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s2_32">poison was to be given in such small doses that it would kill him over a long period of time. While</div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s2_32">he remains alive, he remains the leader because the masses still know him. He should not die right</div>
<div id="tf_32" class="t s2_32">now, because if he dies right now then Trotsky will be the man to control the country. Before Lenin</div>
<div id="tg_32" class="t s2_32">dies Stalin should make his base solid, and all others should be removed, so after Lenin, Stalin</div>
<div id="th_32" class="t s2_32">will be the second man. So he had to be kept alive but almost in a coma. He became paralyzed</div>
<div id="ti_32" class="t s2_32">and slowly, slowly was dying.</div>
<div id="tj_32" class="t s2_32">He was conﬁned to his bed; his eyesight was disappearing, and</div>
<div id="tk_32" class="t s2_32">whatsoever Stalin was bringing him, he was signing it – he could not read it. Stalin killed everybody</div>
<div id="tl_32" class="t s2_32">necessary, and then he killed Lenin, then the last dose was given to Lenin.</div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s2_32">The time that Trotsky remained in Mexico he devoted to writing the biography of Stalin. It is a rare</div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s2_32">book because never has an enemy written a biography with such great insight, with such profundity,</div>
<div id="to_32" class="t s2_32">with no hatred – just factual, no ﬁction. He was killed when he was completing the last page. It</div>
<div id="tp_32" class="t s2_32">remains incomplete – the last page. It is a big biography, nearabout twelve hundred pages. He was</div>
<div id="tq_32" class="t s2_32">writing the last page when he was killed with a hammer from the back. The hammer was hit on</div>
<div id="tr_32" class="t s2_32">his head many times. His head fell on the book and splashed the blood onto the last page. In a</div>
<div id="ts_32" class="t s2_32">way, that made the book an absolutely authoritative biography of what he had been saying all along</div>
<div id="tt_32" class="t s2_32">about how people had been killed. He was killed on the last page; he died on the book, and the ﬁrst</div>
<div id="tu_32" class="t s2_32">edition was printed with the blood marks.</div>
<div id="tv_32" class="t s2_32">Stalin had never killed a single man before; he had never committed a single crime.</div>
<div id="tw_32" class="t s2_32">In fact, his</div>
<div id="tx_32" class="t s2_32">education had happened in a Catholic monastery – he was a Christian, and the monks had raised</div>
<div id="ty_32" class="t s2_32">him. He lived in the monastery because his village was far away in the Caucasus, and the monastery</div>
<div id="tz_32" class="t s2_32">was the only place where education was possible, so his father had left him there; he was a poor</div>
<div id="t10_32" class="t s2_32">man. The monks at the monastery, out of compassion, accepted the boy, trained him, educated him</div>
<div id="t11_32" class="t s2_32">– and this is what he turned out to be. After gaining power he must have killed millions of people.</div>
<div id="t12_32" class="t s2_32">There is no way to count them; he simply went on killing. Anybody who was not for him was to be</div>
<div id="t13_32" class="t s2_32">killed. There was no other punishment. He made it very simple: ”Either you are for me, or you are</div>
<div id="t14_32" class="t s2_32">no more.”</div>
<div id="t15_32" class="t s2_32">The politician is basically a criminal. He is trying to ﬁnd power through legal methods, that is the</div>
<div id="t16_32" class="t s2_32">difference. The criminal does not bother about the legal methods, and gets caught. The politician</div>
<div id="t17_32" class="t s2_32">never gets caught – or only once in a while like Nixon got caught in Watergate. And do you know</div>
<div id="t18_32" class="t s2_32">what Mao Tse-tung said when Nixon was caught? ”What is this? So much fuss about nothing. Every</div>
<div id="t19_32" class="t s2_32">politician is doing it!” In fact every politician is doing it. Watergate was not something exceptional</div>
<div id="t1a_32" class="t s2_32">that Nixon was doing. All over the world, all the politicians who are in power are doing the same</div>
<div id="t1b_32" class="t s2_32">kinds of things; they are just not getting caught. It was a misfortune that he got caught, and couldn’t</div>
<div id="t1c_32" class="t s2_32">manage</div>
<div id="t1d_32" class="t s2_32">....</div>
<div id="t1e_32" class="t s2_32">From Ignorance to Innocence</div>
<div id="t1f_32" class="t s2_32">32</div>
<div id="t1g_32" class="t s3_32">Osho</div>
