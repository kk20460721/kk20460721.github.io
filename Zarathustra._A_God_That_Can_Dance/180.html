<div id="t1_180" class="t s1_180">CHAPTER 14. OF THE WAY OF THE CREATOR</div>
<div id="t2_180" class="t s2_180">FOR SEE, IT IS STILL THIS SAME CONSCIENCE THAT CAUSES YOUR GRIEF: AND THE</div>
<div id="t3_180" class="t s2_180">LAST GLIMMER OF THIS CONSCIENCE STILL GLOWS IN YOUR AFFLICTION. There WILL be</div>
<div id="t4_180" class="t s2_180">problems.</div>
<div id="t5_180" class="t s2_180">All the great painters, poets, singers, musicians, have either gone mad or have even</div>
<div id="t6_180" class="t s2_180">committed suicide. Their madness is simply because everybody thinks they are abnormal.</div>
<div id="t7_180" class="t s2_180">Van Gogh has fallen in love with one of his faraway cousin-sisters. There was nothing wrong in it,</div>
<div id="t8_180" class="t s2_180">but he was a poor man, and on top of it he was a painter. Nobody liked his paintings, nobody could</div>
<div id="t9_180" class="t s2_180">even understand what he is painting – nor could he explain.</div>
<div id="ta_180" class="t s2_180">He used to say, ”It is strange, nobody asks the trees ‘What is your meaning?’</div>
<div id="tb_180" class="t s2_180">Nobody asks the</div>
<div id="tc_180" class="t s2_180">ﬂowers, ‘What is your purpose?’ The ﬂower is just beautiful! To be beautiful is enough; no other</div>
<div id="td_180" class="t s2_180">purpose is needed. My painting is a ﬂower. Why should you ask me the meaning, the purpose? It</div>
<div id="te_180" class="t s2_180">is not a commodity, it is a creative act. Just as nature creates, I am also part of nature. It is also a</div>
<div id="tf_180" class="t s2_180">creation of nature.”</div>
<div id="tg_180" class="t s2_180">He proposed to the girl. She could not believe that he would dare to do such a thing. Everybody</div>
<div id="th_180" class="t s2_180">thought that he was abnormal. It was evening the sun had set, and they were sitting by the light of</div>
<div id="ti_180" class="t s2_180">a beautiful candle. The girl simply joked. She said, ”Do you really mean you love me? Then keep</div>
<div id="tj_180" class="t s2_180">your hand on the ﬂame of the candle as long as I want. That will be a proof.” Van Gogh put his hand</div>
<div id="tk_180" class="t s2_180">on the candle and burnt his hand. The girl could not believe... she removed the candle. Now it is</div>
<div id="tl_180" class="t s2_180">absolutely certain that the man was mad.</div>
<div id="tm_180" class="t s2_180">Love is one thing, but you don’t have to give such proofs, and anybody who can give such proofs</div>
<div id="tn_180" class="t s2_180">can be dangerous. Her father told him never to come to his house again. Van Gogh said, ”But what</div>
<div id="to_180" class="t s2_180">wrong have I done? Your girl has asked me to give proof of my love. I can give proof even by my</div>
<div id="tp_180" class="t s2_180">death. My love is greater than my life.” Although he was saying tremendously meaningful words, he</div>
<div id="tq_180" class="t s2_180">was pushed aside and the doors were closed.</div>
<div id="tr_180" class="t s2_180">His brother loved him very much, and he felt deep compassion for him; he was not harming anybody.</div>
<div id="ts_180" class="t s2_180">Still, everybody seemed to be against him. The only thing that he was doing was not following the</div>
<div id="tt_180" class="t s2_180">crowd. His father wanted him to go to a Christian seminary where he could learn to be a Christian</div>
<div id="tu_180" class="t s2_180">priest, and he said, ”Priest? I want to be a painter. I am not mad enough to be a priest.” His father</div>
<div id="tv_180" class="t s2_180">was ready to give him money to be a priest, but he was not ready to give him money to be a painter</div>
<div id="tw_180" class="t s2_180">or to send him to a painting school. His brother felt deeply for him. He asked a prostitute, ”In his</div>
<div id="tx_180" class="t s2_180">whole life” – Van Gogh was thirty – ”he has never known love. It would be very kind of you... I will</div>
<div id="ty_180" class="t s2_180">give you the money... you pretend to love him.” The prostitute was willing; it was her profession, and</div>
<div id="tz_180" class="t s2_180">there was no problem. She met him as if by accident and started talking to him about his paintings,</div>
<div id="t10_180" class="t s2_180">saying they were great...”And by the way,” she said, ”you are so beautiful.” Nobody had ever said</div>
<div id="t11_180" class="t s2_180">that. Van Gogh said, ”What do you think is beautiful in me?” Even the prostitute was in difﬁculty to</div>
<div id="t12_180" class="t s2_180">say what was beautiful in him – Van Gogh was not a very beautiful man. She said, ”I love your ears”</div>
<div id="t13_180" class="t s2_180">– ﬁnding nothing else.</div>
<div id="t14_180" class="t s2_180">In the middle of the night, van Gogh came with both his ears – he had cut them off and put them in</div>
<div id="t15_180" class="t s2_180">a packet – and offered those two ears to the woman, and he said, ”In my whole life somebody has</div>
<div id="t16_180" class="t s2_180">loved something in me. I want to offer them to you; you can have them.” Blood was coming from</div>
<div id="t17_180" class="t s2_180">both the ears... the woman freaked out. She thought that he was really mad. What more proof do</div>
<div id="t18_180" class="t s2_180">you need?</div>
<div id="t19_180" class="t s2_180">Zarathustra: A God That Can Dance</div>
<div id="t1a_180" class="t s2_180">180</div>
