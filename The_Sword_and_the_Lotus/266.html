<div id="t1_266" class="t s1_266">CHAPTER 21. SOMETHING DEEPER THAN THE MIND</div>
<div id="t2_266" class="t s2_266">cupboard, locked it, and shouted loudly, ”Thief, thief!” He ran out from the same hole he had come</div>
<div id="t3_266" class="t s2_266">in, leaving the young man locked inside the cupboard.</div>
<div id="t4_266" class="t s2_266">You can imagine what happened to the young man. He wanted to kill his father! But he had no</div>
<div id="t5_266" class="t s2_266">hope that he would ever see him again. He would go directly to jail for his whole life. It was such an</div>
<div id="t6_266" class="t s2_266">unfortunate moment that he had asked... but now nothing could be done.</div>
<div id="t7_266" class="t s2_266">The whole house was awake. Servants were running here and there, and they found the hole in the</div>
<div id="t8_266" class="t s2_266">wall. It was certain a thief had been in. They found all the doors open.</div>
<div id="t9_266" class="t s2_266">One maidservant went, following the doors which were open, and reached to the innermost chamber</div>
<div id="ta_266" class="t s2_266">– there was nobody. The man was inside the cupboard but he could see that some light had come</div>
<div id="tb_266" class="t s2_266">in; the maidservant was carrying a candle in her hand. He could hear her footsteps, and suddenly</div>
<div id="tc_266" class="t s2_266">he started making scratching noises as if some rat was inside the cupboard. He was amazed at</div>
<div id="td_266" class="t s2_266">himself, what he was doing. And the maidservant, thinking that there was a rat inside, unlocked the</div>
<div id="te_266" class="t s2_266">door. And as she opened the door, the young man blew out the candle, pushed the maidservant,</div>
<div id="tf_266" class="t s2_266">ran away as fast as he could, and jumped out of the hole. A crowd of guards, and the neighbors,</div>
<div id="tg_266" class="t s2_266">and the master of the house, and other servants... all were following him with torches in their hands.</div>
<div id="th_266" class="t s2_266">He was a champion, a national champion in running. But he was amazed, he had never run this</div>
<div id="ti_266" class="t s2_266">fast, even while he was competing for a championship, a national championship. He was running at</div>
<div id="tj_266" class="t s2_266">least four times faster. It was a question of life and death, not just winning a trophy.</div>
<div id="tk_266" class="t s2_266">But he was afraid they would catch him anyhow. Where could he go? If he went to his house he</div>
<div id="tl_266" class="t s2_266">would be caught. But as he was running, he came across a well and he saw a rock. He took the</div>
<div id="tm_266" class="t s2_266">rock, threw it into the well and ran away. All this happened not through thinking, neither the noise he</div>
<div id="tn_266" class="t s2_266">had made in the cupboard... because the mind can only do something which it knows already. Now</div>
<div id="to_266" class="t s2_266">this was an absolutely new situation – the computer of the mind could not function.</div>
<div id="tp_266" class="t s2_266">In a new situation the mind stops because it has no answer. Ask the old questions and it is a great</div>
<div id="tq_266" class="t s2_266">scholar.</div>
<div id="tr_266" class="t s2_266">Nor had he ever run with such a great speed. His mind was not doing it; it was something deeper</div>
<div id="ts_266" class="t s2_266">than the mind, greater than the mind, more vital than the mind – it was his basic energy. This is</div>
<div id="tt_266" class="t s2_266">what is called running ”from the very guts.” And then suddenly, when he threw the rock into the well,</div>
<div id="tu_266" class="t s2_266">he was not able to understand what he was doing and why he was doing it. It was all happening – it</div>
<div id="tv_266" class="t s2_266">was not a conclusion of the mind.</div>
<div id="tw_266" class="t s2_266">And because of the noise in the well the whole crowd gathered around thinking that he had jumped</div>
<div id="tx_266" class="t s2_266">into the well. And even though they had torches they were of no use for looking into the well. The</div>
<div id="ty_266" class="t s2_266">well was deep and they would have to wait for the morning. And they thought that now there was</div>
<div id="tz_266" class="t s2_266">no problem either. Either the man would die, or if he survived the whole night, in the morning they</div>
<div id="t10_266" class="t s2_266">could catch hold of him. ”Just keep the well guarded” – and they all went back home.</div>
<div id="t11_266" class="t s2_266">The young man reached his home. He could not believe that his father was fast asleep, snoring. He</div>
<div id="t12_266" class="t s2_266">looked at his father and he thought, ”What to say to this old man?” He was angry, but he was also</div>
<div id="t13_266" class="t s2_266">amazed that he had put his only son in such a dangerous situation. And still he was not tense, he</div>
<div id="t14_266" class="t s2_266">was already fast asleep.</div>
<div id="t15_266" class="t s2_266">The Sword and the Lotus</div>
<div id="t16_266" class="t s2_266">266</div>
