<div id="t1_88" class="t s1_88">CHAPTER 5. ECSTASY IS POLARITIES MEETING</div>
<div id="t2_88" class="t s2_88">The Jews were very disturbed because Jesus was claiming that he was God, or God’s son. For two</div>
<div id="t3_88" class="t s2_88">thousand years Christians have been defending Jesus – that he was God, that he is God.</div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s2_88">And they have been trying to efface ALL the possibilities with which it can be proved that he is man.</div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s2_88">That’s why they say he was born out of a virgin mother – that is the beginning. So they deny his</div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s2_88">manhood, so he is not just like you; he is special. Even in his birth he is special. Then they try to</div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s2_88">make his life in such a way that no indications are left that he was human. He was very human,</div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s2_88">utterly human. He was a total man. He was not a perfectionist. When it was needed to be angry</div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s2_88">he became really angry. He threw the money-changers out of the temple and he said to them ’What</div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s2_88">are you doing here in my Father’s home, in my Father’s temple? Get out from here!’ And he was in</div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s2_88">such a rage, that alone, single-handed, he threw many people outside.</div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s2_88">He loved people. He had friends, he mixed with people. He ate with people, drank with people,</div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s2_88">he moved with people. He lived like an ordinary man. He had no pretensions of being anything</div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s2_88">extraordinary. And even if something extraordinary happens, he always says ’It is your faith that has</div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s2_88">performed the miracle. It is God’s mercy on you. It is something between you and your God.’ He</div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s2_88">does not even expect gratitude. Somebody is very grateful because a miracle has happened and he</div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s2_88">has been cured, and he wants to touch his feet and thank him, and he says ’No.’ And the man says</div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s2_88">’You are a great man, you are so good!’ and Jesus says ’Nobody is good except God. You thank</div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s2_88">him. Forget about me. It is your faith that has cured you, not I. And if you have to be thankful, you</div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s2_88">have to be thankful to God. Forget about me. Don’t allow me to be between you and your God.’</div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s2_88">That’s exactly what Buddha is reported to have said to his disciples ’If you meet me on the way, kill</div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s2_88">me immediately. Never allow me to stand between you and the reality. Hold my hand as far as you</div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s2_88">are not capable of walking alone and on your own. The moment you are capable of walking alone</div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s2_88">and on your own, just forget about me. Go ahead. Then don’t cling to me. Then don’t try to remain</div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s2_88">a shadow of me. If you meet me on the way, kill me immediately!’ he says. That’s what Jesus goes</div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s2_88">on saying again and again ’Forget about me. Let your thanks go directly to God. Who am I?’</div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s2_88">Christians have been trying to efface all traces of his humanity; so he is born out of the virgin Mary, a</div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s2_88">virgin mother, which is absolutely absurd. Then he lives a life in which all human traits are removed.</div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s2_88">Christians only talk about his miracles, not about his ordinary life. They are afraid. Christians say that</div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s2_88">Jesus never laughed! Now this seems to be the ultimate in stupidity. Jesus... and never laughed?</div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s2_88">Then who else can laugh? But laughter seems too human, too mundane: they cannot allow Jesus</div>
<div id="tw_88" class="t s2_88">to laugh.</div>
<div id="tx_88" class="t s2_88">But Jesus’ life is such that he must have been laughing. He must have been really laughing. He</div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s2_88">must have been a man of laughter, because he says again and again ’Rejoice! Be merry! Celebrate!’</div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s2_88">These words cannot come from d man who has never laughed. And a man who has never laughed,</div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s2_88">why should he go to parties?</div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s2_88">Why should he drink with people?</div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s2_88">Why should he be mixing with</div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s2_88">people?</div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s2_88">And he was a mixer.</div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s2_88">Every day, every night, he was moving with people.</div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s2_88">He was not</div>
<div id="t17_88" class="t s2_88">secluded. He must have been really laughing, enjoying. But Christians say he never laughed.</div>
<div id="t18_88" class="t s2_88">They have made his picture very sad-looking, long-faced, burdened. This is not possible! This is</div>
<div id="t19_88" class="t s2_88">utterly wrong, because it goes against the basic realisation of a Christ, of a Buddha. Because a</div>
<div id="t1a_88" class="t s2_88">man who has attained to ultimate consciousness will be completely blissful, cheerful. His life will be</div>
<div id="t1b_88" class="t s2_88">a song and a dance. It will have the quality of ﬂowers and stars. It can’t be sad. Why should he</div>
<div id="t1c_88" class="t s2_88">I Say Unto You, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t1d_88" class="t s2_88">88</div>
