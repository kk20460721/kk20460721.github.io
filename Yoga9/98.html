<div id="t2_98" class="t s1_98">important; otherwise where to meet, how to function, how to be efficient? If everybody </div>

<div id="t4_98" class="t s1_98">everybody comes to the station at his own time, then trains can never leave. Something </div>
<div id="t5_98" class="t s1_98">arbitrary has to be fixed. </div>
<div id="t6_98" class="t s1_98">The chronological time is history, and the psychological time is myth. That is the </div>
<div id="t7_98" class="t s1_98">difference between history and myth. In the West history is written, in the East myth. If </div>
<div id="t8_98" class="t s1_98">you ask when Krishna was born, the exact date, no answer will be coming from </div>
<div id="t9_98" class="t s1_98">anywhere. And it is easy for historians to prove that if you cannot prove on what date, at </div>
<div id="ta_98" class="t s1_98">what time chronologically, Krishna was born, at what place -- if you cannot show the </div>
<div id="tb_98" class="t s1_98">space and time when the event of Krishna's birth happened </div>
<div id="tc_98" class="t s1_98">-- then it is doubtful whether </div>
<div id="td_98" class="t s1_98">Krishna was ever born or not. </div>
<div id="te_98" class="t s1_98">The East has never bothered. The East simply laughs at the whole absurdity of it. What </div>
<div id="tf_98" class="t s1_98">has chronological time to do with Krishna's birth? We don't have any record. Or we have </div>
<div id="tg_98" class="t s1_98">many records, contradictory, contradicting each other. </div>
<div id="th_98" class="t s1_98">But, see, I was born on eleventh December. If it can be proved that I was not born on </div>
<div id="ti_98" class="t s1_98">eleventh December, will it be enough proof that I was never born? </div>
<div id="tj_98" class="t s1_98">In the East nobody remembers his own birthday. Just the other day Vivek was worried </div>
<div id="tk_98" class="t s1_98">about her father's birthday. Maybe it is the twenty-seventh, or some other date, and she is </div>
<div id="tl_98" class="t s1_98">worried that if she writes and asks, then they will feel offended. And I told her I don't </div>

<div id="tn_98" class="t s1_98">or not. But that cannot prove that they have never existed or they are not there. </div>
<div id="to_98" class="t s1_98">The East has written myth. Myth is totally different; it is with psychological time. </div>
<div id="tp_98" class="t s1_98">The chronological time moves linearly, in a line. That's why in the West they say there is </div>
<div id="tq_98" class="t s1_98">nothing new under the sun </div>
<div id="tr_98" class="t s1_98">-- but history never repeats itself. Time moves in a line, so </div>

<div id="tt_98" class="t s1_98">history is a wheel. It does not move linearly; the movement is circular. And in the East </div>
<div id="tu_98" class="t s1_98">we say there is nothing new under the sun and history continuously repeats itself. It is all </div>
<div id="tv_98" class="t s1_98">repetition, so why be worried about when Krishna was born? </div>
<div id="tw_98" class="t s1_98">In the East we say that in each age Krishna is born again and again and again. It is a </div>
<div id="tx_98" class="t s1_98">wheel. In each period between creation and destruction, Krishna is born again and again. </div>
<div id="ty_98" class="t s1_98">His form may differ, his name may differ, but he is born again and again; so why bother? </div>
<div id="tz_98" class="t s1_98">Just describe who he is and don't be worried too much about nonessential details. So it </div>

<div id="t11_98" class="t s1_98">synthesis of all the Krishnas. That's how it is. </div>
<div id="t12_98" class="t s1_98">If you ask, "Is Buddha's statue true to his image?" -- it is not. Yet it is true because a </div>
<div id="t13_98" class="t s1_98">Buddha has to be like that. It is not a question whether this Buddha -- Gautam Siddharth, </div>
<div id="t14_98" class="t s1_98">son of Shuddhodhan, born in Kapilvastu on a particular date -- was like this statue. No, it </div>
<div id="t15_98" class="t s1_98">is not a point. But all the Buddhas always are synthesized in this statue. They represent. </div>
<div id="t16_98" class="t s1_98">This statue is just a statue of BuddhaHOOD, not of any Buddha in particular. All </div>
<div id="t17_98" class="t s1_98">Buddhas are included in it. </div>
<div id="t18_98" class="t s1_98">Now this is difficult for the West. You cannot make any difference between Buddha and </div>
<div id="t19_98" class="t s1_98">Mahavir except for a small symbol just down near their feet; otherwise you cannot make </div>
<div id="t1a_98" class="t s1_98">much difference. Jainas have twenty-four teerthankeras, twenty-four great Masters, but </div>
<div id="t1b_98" class="t s1_98">you cannot make any distinction. Go to a Jaina temple and just look; they all look alike. It </div>
