<div id="t1_26" class="t s1_26">ready even to accept those paintings as gifts from Vincent van Gogh -- the same </div>
<div id="t2_26" class="t s1_26">paintings. He had given them to friends, to anybody who was ready to hang them in </div>
<div id="t3_26" class="t s1_26">their room. Nobody was ready to hang his pictures in their rooms because people were </div>
<div id="t4_26" class="t s1_26">worried. Others would ask, "Have you gone mad or something? What kind of painting </div>
<div id="t5_26" class="t s1_26">is this?" </div>
<div id="t6_26" class="t s1_26">Vincent van Gogh had his own world. He has brought a new vision. It took many many </div>
<div id="t7_26" class="t s1_26">decades; slowly slowly, humanity started feeling that something was there. Humanity </div>
<div id="t8_26" class="t s1_26">is slow and lethargic; it lags behind time. And the creative person is always ahead of his </div>
<div id="t9_26" class="t s1_26">time, hence the gap. </div>
<div id="ta_26" class="t s1_26">So, Barbara, if you really want to be creative you will have to accept that you can't be </div>
<div id="tb_26" class="t s1_26">famous, you can't be well-known. If you really want to be creative, then you have to </div>
<div id="tc_26" class="t s1_26">learn the simple phenomenon: art for art's sake, for no other motive. Then enjoy </div>
<div id="td_26" class="t s1_26">whatsoever you are doing. If you can find a few friends to enjoy it, good; if nobody is </div>
<div id="te_26" class="t s1_26">there to enjoy, then enjoy it alone. If YOU are enjoying it, that is enough. If you feel </div>
<div id="tf_26" class="t s1_26">fulfilled through it, that is enough. </div>
<div id="tg_26" class="t s1_26">You ask me, "I am not sure anymore what the qualities of true art are." </div>
<div id="th_26" class="t s1_26">True art means: if it helps you to become silent, still, joyous; if it gives you a celebration; </div>
<div id="ti_26" class="t s1_26">if it makes you dance -- whether anybody participates with you or not is irrelevant; if it </div>
<div id="tj_26" class="t s1_26">becomes a bridge between you and God -- that is true art. If it becomes a meditation, </div>
<div id="tk_26" class="t s1_26">that is true art. If you become absorbed in it, so utterly absorbed that the ego </div>
<div id="tl_26" class="t s1_26">disappears, that is true art. </div>
<div id="tm_26" class="t s1_26">True art comes very close to religion. So don't be worried what true art is. If you rejoice </div>
<div id="tn_26" class="t s1_26">in doing it, if you feel lost in doing it, if you feel overwhelmed with joy and peace in </div>
<div id="to_26" class="t s1_26">doing it, it is true art. And don't be bothered what critics say. Critics don't know </div>
<div id="tp_26" class="t s1_26">anything about art. In fact, the people who cannot become artists become critics. If you </div>
<div id="tq_26" class="t s1_26">cannot participate in a running race, if you cannot be an Olympic runner, at least you </div>
<div id="tr_26" class="t s1_26">can stand by the side of the road and throw stones at other runners; that you can do </div>
<div id="ts_26" class="t s1_26">easily. </div>
<div id="tt_26" class="t s1_26">That's what critics go on doing. They can't be participants, they can't create anything. </div>
<div id="tu_26" class="t s1_26">I have heard about a Sufi mystic who loved painting, and all the critics of his time were </div>
<div id="tv_26" class="t s1_26">against him. Everybody would come and show him, "This is wrong, that is wrong." </div>
<div id="tw_26" class="t s1_26">He became tired of these people, so one day, in front of his house he hung all his </div>
<div id="tx_26" class="t s1_26">paintings and he invited all the critics and told them to come with brushes, with colors, </div>
<div id="ty_26" class="t s1_26">so that they can correct his paintings, because they have criticized enough; now the time </div>
<div id="tz_26" class="t s1_26">has come to correct. </div>
<div id="t10_26" class="t s1_26">Not a single critic turned up. It is easy to criticize, it is difficult to correct. And since </div>
<div id="t11_26" class="t s1_26">then critics stopped coming and stopped criticizing his paintings. He did the right </div>
<div id="t12_26" class="t s1_26">thing. </div>
<div id="t13_26" class="t s1_26">People who don't know how to create become critics. So don't be worried about them. </div>
<div id="t14_26" class="t s1_26">The decisive thing is your inner feeling, inner glow, inner warmth. If making music </div>
<div id="t15_26" class="t s1_26">gives you a feeling of warmth, joy arises in you, ego disappears, then it becomes a </div>
