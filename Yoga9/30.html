<div id="t2_30" class="t s1_30">IF MULLA NASRUDIN CAME TO THE ASHRAM, </div>
<div id="t3_30" class="t s1_30">WOULD YOU PUT HIM IN ONE OF THE GROUPS? </div>
<div id="t4_30" class="t s1_30">OR WOULD YOU TELL HIM TO RUN A GROUP OF HIS OWN? </div>
<div id="t5_30" class="t s1_30">IF SO, WHAT KIND OF GROUP WOULD;T BE? </div>
<div id="t6_30" class="t s1_30">I have done it before. It didn't work. Mulla Nasrudin is a leader of leaders. He cannot be </div>
<div id="t7_30" class="t s1_30">put in a group as a participant; his ego won't allow it. I had asked him. He said, "Okay, </div>
<div id="t8_30" class="t s1_30">you can make me a leader." I gave him an opportunity, a three-day group; and all the </div>
<div id="t9_30" class="t s1_30">fools and all the wise guys gathered to participate. Because Mulla Nasrudin has appeal </div>
<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">for both. Those who are fools, they think him a fool. Those who are wise, they think him </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">a wise man. He is tricky, or his is just a border case -- he stands on both the sides. He can </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">be interpreted as a foolish man; he can be interpreted as one of the most wise ever. </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">He stood before the group and he said, "Do you know what I am going to teach you?" </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">Of course everybody said, "How can we know? We don't know." </div>
<div id="tf_30" class="t s1_30">He said, "If you don't even know that, that much, I am not going to teach, because you </div>
<div id="tg_30" class="t s1_30">are not worth it." </div>
<div id="th_30" class="t s1_30">He left. The next day I persuaded him again. He again went there and asked the </div>
<div id="ti_30" class="t s1_30">participants, "Do you know what I am going to teach?" </div>
<div id="tj_30" class="t s1_30">Now they had learned a little, so they said, "Yes, we know." </div>
<div id="tk_30" class="t s1_30">He said, "Then what is the point? If you know, you know," and he left. </div>
<div id="tl_30" class="t s1_30">I persuaded him the third day again. He stood there; he asked, "Do you know what I am </div>
<div id="tm_30" class="t s1_30">going to teach?" </div>
<div id="tn_30" class="t s1_30">Now the people had learned a little more; they said, "Yes. Half of us know and half of us </div>

<div id="tp_30" class="t s1_30">He said, "Perfectly good. So those who know, tell those who don't know. What is the </div>

<div id="tr_30" class="t s1_30">Mulla Nasrudin is a very, very old Sufi device. Whether this man ever existed or not is </div>
<div id="ts_30" class="t s1_30">not certain. He may have existed, he may not have existed. There are many countries who </div>
<div id="tt_30" class="t s1_30">claim him. kan claims him; they have a tomb in Iran of Mulla Nasrudin. Soviet Russia </div>
<div id="tu_30" class="t s1_30">also claims him. There are other countries, they also claim. Almost the whole Middle </div>
<div id="tv_30" class="t s1_30">East claims that he belonged to us. And there are many places where they say here his </div>
<div id="tw_30" class="t s1_30">body is buried. </div>
<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">He may have existed, may not have existed, but his impact has been tremendous. </div>
<div id="ty_30" class="t s1_30">Whatsoever he has done, or whatsoever is depicted as done by him is very, very </div>
<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">meaningful even in this anecdote, in which he asks, "Do you know what I am going to </div>
<div id="t10_30" class="t s1_30">say to you?" Everybody said, "No," but nobody was silent. "No" comes easily; to be an </div>
<div id="t11_30" class="t s1_30">atheist is very easy. But it is difficult if you have a no attitude, then it is difficult to teach </div>
<div id="t12_30" class="t s1_30">you. The next day everybody said, "Yes," because they were too greedy to listen to what </div>
<div id="t13_30" class="t s1_30">he wants to say. Their yes was out of greed, and greed can never be satisfied. And Mulla </div>
<div id="t14_30" class="t s1_30">said, "If you know already, then what is the point?" The third day they tried to prove </div>
<div id="t15_30" class="t s1_30">more cunning and clever. They said we have tried two alternatives, now try the third, the </div>
<div id="t16_30" class="t s1_30">only remaining one: "Half of us know and half of us don't know." Now they were trying </div>
<div id="t17_30" class="t s1_30">to fix Mulla in his place, but you cannot fix him. He is almost like mercury; he slips out </div>
