<div id="t1_52" class="t s1_52">And the greatest thing to learn is not to hold onto anything: to your love, to your joy, to </div>
<div id="t2_52" class="t s1_52">your body, to your health. Enjoy everything -- your health, your body, your love, your </div>
<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">woman, your man -- but don't cling. Keep your hands open -- don't become a fist. If you </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">become a fist you become closed -- closed to the winds and the rains and the sun and </div>
<div id="t5_52" class="t s1_52">the moon, closed to God himself. And that is the ugliest way to live; it is creating a </div>
<div id="t6_52" class="t s1_52">grave around yourself. Then your existence is windowless. You go on suffocating inside </div>
<div id="t7_52" class="t s1_52">and you are suffocating because you think you are creating safety and security for </div>
<div id="t8_52" class="t s1_52">yourself. </div>
<div id="t9_52" class="t s1_52">I have heard an ancient Sufi parable: </div>
<div id="ta_52" class="t s1_52">A king was very much afraid of death, as everyone is -- and the more you have, the </div>
<div id="tb_52" class="t s1_52">more, of course, you are afraid. A poor man is not as much afraid of death. What has he </div>
<div id="tc_52" class="t s1_52">got to lose? What has life given to him? He remains unconcerned. </div>
<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">That's why in poor countries you will see again and again a great indifference about </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">death, poverty, starvation. The reason is, people have lived in such poverty for so long </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">that now they are not so worried about death. Death comes to them as a relief -- relief </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">from all the miseries and anxieties, relief from starvation, suffering, poverty. </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">People coming from richer countries think, "Why are they so indifferent to death?" The </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">reason is simple: there is nothing to cling to. Their life has not given anything to them. </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">Their life is so poor that death can't take anything away from them; it can't make them </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">poorer than they already are. But the more you have, the more you become afraid of </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">death. The richer the society, the more fear of death. </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">In poor societies the taboo is sex, and in richer societies the taboo is death. That is an </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">indication whether the society is rich or poor -- you can just look at what their taboo is. </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">If they are very much against sex that means they are poor; if they are very much </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">against death, even afraid to mention it, that simply means they are rich. Hence it is a </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">very difficult encounter between poor countries and richer countries -- their taboos </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">clash. </div>
<div id="ts_52" class="t s1_52">This is happening every day here, because my people have come from all over the </div>
<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">world and the poor Indian society has the taboo against sex. Sex is their problem, sex is </div>
<div id="tu_52" class="t s1_52">their fear. Birth is their fear, not death. They think of how to stop birth, they ponder </div>
<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">over birth control methods. In richer countries the scientists go on searching how to </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">postpone death. In poor countries the problem is how to postpone birth. </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">So the king was very much afraid, naturally. He had so much and death would take </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">everything away; and he had wasted his whole life in accumulating. How to protect </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">himself? And in accumulating so much wealth he had created many enemies and they </div>
<div id="t10_52" class="t s1_52">were always in search of an opportunity to cut off his head, to shoot him. </div>
<div id="t11_52" class="t s1_52">He took advice from old, wise people of his country. They told him to make a castle </div>
<div id="t12_52" class="t s1_52">with only one door -- no windows, no other doors, just a single door to enter into and to </div>
<div id="t13_52" class="t s1_52">come out of. He would be safe. And on the door he could place a one-thousand-strong </div>
<div id="t14_52" class="t s1_52">security force so it would be impossible for anybody to enter. </div>
<div id="t15_52" class="t s1_52">The idea was appealing. He made a big castle with no windows, no doors, except the </div>
<div id="t16_52" class="t s1_52">one door which was guarded by one thousand warriors. </div>
