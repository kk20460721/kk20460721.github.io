<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">CHAPTER 9. THE UNKNOWN LIFE OF JESUS</div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s2_91">He was moving toward the cross. Pilate asked him, ”What is truth?” Jesus had spent his whole life</div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s2_91">talking about truth; he was deﬁning only that, that is why Pilate asked him. But he remained silent.</div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s2_91">What happened in Jesus’ inner world has never been reported because it is difﬁcult to report.</div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s2_91">Christianity has allowed it to remain submerged because what happened in the inner world of Jesus</div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s2_91">can only be interpreted in India, nowhere else. Only India knows about the inner changes, the inner</div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s2_91">transformation that happens.</div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s2_91">What happened was this: Jesus is suddenly on the verge of cruciﬁxion. He is about to be cruciﬁed</div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s2_91">and now his whole revolution is meaningless. Everything that he has been saying is futile, everything</div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s2_91">that he has been living for is coming to an end. Everything is ﬁnished. And because death is so</div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s2_91">near, he must now move within. No time can be lost, not a single moment can be lost. He must</div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s2_91">come to the end of his journey now, and before he is cruciﬁed he must complete the inner journey.</div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s2_91">All along he had been on an inner journey. But because he was also entangled with outer problems</div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s2_91">he could not move to that cool point, the moon point; he remained ﬁery, hot. But it may be that he did</div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s2_91">this consciously. Jesus was a disciple of John the Baptist who was a great revolutionary and spiritual</div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s2_91">leader. John the Baptist had waited for Jesus for many years. Then, on the day he initiated Jesus in</div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s2_91">the River Jordan, he said to Jesus, ”Now take over my work and I will disappear. It is enough.” And</div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s2_91">from that day on, he was rarely seen again; he disappeared. In the words of the inner language, he</div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s2_91">disappeared from the sun point and moved to the moon point; he became silent. He had done his</div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s2_91">work and had now given the work to someone who would complete it.</div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s2_91">On the day of the cruciﬁxion Jesus must have become aware that now his work was ﬁnished: ”There</div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s2_91">is no longer any possibility of doing anything more now. I must move within. The opportunity must</div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s2_91">not be lost.” That is why, when Pilate asked him what truth is, he remained silent. Because of this,</div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s2_91">the miracle happened which has remained an enigma for Christianity. Because of this.</div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s2_91">As he was moving to his cooler side, to the moon center, he was cruciﬁed. When someone comes</div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s2_91">to the moon center for the ﬁrst time, his breathing stops because breathing, too, is an activity of the</div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s2_91">sun point. Now everything becomes silent; everything is as if dead. They thought he was dead, but</div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s2_91">he was not. He had simply come to the moon center where breathing stops: no outgoing breath, no</div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s2_91">ingoing breath – the gap.</div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s2_91">When one remains in the gap, there is such a deep balance that it is a virtual death. But it is not</div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s2_91">death. The cruciﬁers, the murderers of Jesus, thought that he was dead so they allowed his disciples</div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s2_91">to bring the body down. But he was not dead, and when the cave was opened after three days he</div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s2_91">was not there. The ”dead” body had disappeared. After three days, Jesus was seen again by four</div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s2_91">or ﬁve people. But no one would believe them when they went to the villages to say that Jesus was</div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s2_91">resurrected. No one would believe it.</div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s2_91">When he escaped from Jerusalem, Jesus went to Kashmir, where he remained. But then his life was</div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s2_91">not the life of Jesus but the life of Christ. Jesus was the sun point and Christ the moon point. From</div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s2_91">then on, he remained totally silent. That is why there is no record of him. He would not talk, he would</div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s2_91">not deliver any message, he would not preach. He remained in Kashmir, not as a revolutionary but</div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s2_91">as a master, living in his own silence. A few people traveled to be with him. Those who became</div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s2_91">aware of his presence in Kashmir, without having had any outward information about it, would travel</div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s2_91">The Great Challenge</div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s2_91">91</div>
<div id="t18_91" class="t s3_91">Osho</div>
