<div id="t4_36" class="t s1_36">which he looks happy, blissful, joyous? Impossible! You can't conceive of a joyful Jesus -</div>
<div id="t5_36" class="t s1_36">- after two thousand years of Christian propaganda the whole figure of Jesus has </div>

<div id="t7_36" class="t s1_36">He was a man of great joy. He was a man who knew how to laugh and how to love and </div>

<div id="t9_36" class="t s1_36">have joked with his friends, with his disciples. I cannot conceive of him not having a </div>
<div id="ta_36" class="t s1_36">sense of humor, because it is impossible for me to conceive of a man being spiritual and </div>
<div id="tb_36" class="t s1_36">without a sense of humor. A sense of humor is one of the most fundamental qualities of </div>
<div id="tc_36" class="t s1_36">a religious man. </div>
<div id="td_36" class="t s1_36">But the picture that Christians have depicted of Jesus is ugly. He is always sad, in deep </div>
<div id="te_36" class="t s1_36">sorrow -- carrying the whole burden of the original sin committed by Adam and Eve. </div>
<div id="tf_36" class="t s1_36">He has been depicted by the Christians as doing a great service to humanity. He is the </div>
<div id="tg_36" class="t s1_36">savior -- and how can the savior laugh? Laughter seems to be such an earthly quality. </div>
<div id="th_36" class="t s1_36">He has to be very serious, long-faced. They have destroyed the beauty of Jesus. </div>
<div id="ti_36" class="t s1_36">Jesus has to be resurrected. He was killed twice. First he was killed by the Jews and the </div>
<div id="tj_36" class="t s1_36">Romans, and then he has been killed by the Christian priests. He got away from his first </div>
<div id="tk_36" class="t s1_36">murder, but from the second he has not yet been able to escape. He is still a captive of </div>
<div id="tl_36" class="t s1_36">the Vatican; he has to be freed from the Vatican. </div>

<div id="ts_36" class="t s1_36">Krishna seems to be cruel to Christian eyes: playing on his flute, dancing, singing, </div>

<div id="tu_36" class="t s1_36">Krishna to be spiritual. And in fact, the word 'christ' is a derivation of the word </div>

<div id="tw_36" class="t s1_36">Christ. 'Christ' comes from 'krishna', and Krishna-consciousness simply means ecstatic </div>
<div id="tx_36" class="t s1_36">consciousness. </div>
<div id="ty_36" class="t s1_36">But why does the priest go on creating guilt in man? There is a secret behind it. If you </div>

<div id="t15_36" class="t s1_36">Remember, when Buddha says "shame" he does not mean guilt. Shame is a totally </div>
<div id="t16_36" class="t s1_36">different phenomenon. Guilt is imposed by others; shame is your own experience. </div>
<div id="t17_36" class="t s1_36">Shame is interior, guilt is from the outside. Shame is not because of others but because </div>
