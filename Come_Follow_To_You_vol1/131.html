<div id="t1_131" class="t s1_131">Ordinarily your mind will agree with Judas. He seems to be perfectly right. He </div>
<div id="t2_131" class="t s1_131">was a very cultured, polished man of manners -- sophisticated, a thinker. </div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s1_131">And he betrayed. Only he could betray, because on each step his ego was hurt. </div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s1_131">He always felt himself superior to all of Jesus' disciples. He would always keep </div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s1_131">himself aloof, he would not move in the crowd. He always thought that he was </div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s1_131">not part of the crowd. At the most he was second only to Jesus -- and that, too, </div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s1_131">reluctantly. Deep down he must have been thinking himself first. He could not </div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s1_131">say it, but it was in his heart. </div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s1_131">He was madly hurt. Continuously jesus was hurting their egos. A Master has to, </div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s1_131">because if a Master goes on pampering your egos then he will not be of any help, </div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s1_131">he will be poisonous. Then you can commit suicide through him but you cannot </div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s1_131">resurrect. </div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s1_131">Because Judas was the most egoistic, he was hurt more. And Jesus HAD to hurt </div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s1_131">him more. He took revenge. And he was a good man; there is no doubt about it. </div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s1_131">That is the problem with good men. </div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s1_131">He sold Jesus for thirty rupees. He was so concerned with the perfume and its </div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s1_131">cost -- look at the mind! -- and he sold Jesus for thirty rupees, thirty silver pieces. </div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s1_131">Jesus was not even that costly. </div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s1_131">But then, when jesus was murdered, crucified, he started feeling guilty. That's </div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s1_131">how a good man functions. He started feeling very guilty, his conscience started </div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s1_131">pricking him. He committed suicide. He was a good man, he had a conscience. </div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s1_131">But he had no consciousness. </div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s1_131">This distinction has to be felt deeply. Conscience is borrowed, given by the </div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s1_131">society; consciousness is your attainment. The society teaches you what is right </div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s1_131">and what is wrong: do this and don't do that. It gives you the law, the morality, </div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s1_131">the code, the rules of the game. That is your conscience. Outside, the constable; </div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s1_131">inside, the conscience. That is the way that the society controls you. </div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s1_131">If you go to steal, the constable is outside to prevent you. But you can deceive the </div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s1_131">constable, you can find ways. So the society has placed a deep electrode within </div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s1_131">you: the conscience. Your hand starts trembling, your whole inner being -- you </div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s1_131">feel that your inner being is saying, "Don-t do this; this is wrong." This is society </div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s1_131">speaking through you. This is just society, implanted within you. </div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s1_131">Judas had a conscience, but Jesus had consciousness. That was the rift. The man </div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s1_131">of conscience can never understand the man of consciousness because the man of </div>
<div id="tz_131" class="t s1_131">consciousness lives moment to moment, he has no rules to follow. </div>
<div id="t10_131" class="t s1_131">Jesus was more concerned with the love of the woman. Mary. It was such a deep </div>
<div id="t11_131" class="t s1_131">thing that to prevent her would be wounding her love; she would shrink within </div>
<div id="t12_131" class="t s1_131">herself. Pouring the perfume on Jesus' feet was just a gesture. Behind it, Mary </div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s1_131">Magdalen was saying. "I would like to pour the whole of the world on your feet. </div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s1_131">This is all that I have -- the most precious thing I have. To pour water won't be </div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s1_131">enough; it is too cheap. This is the most precious thing that I have, but even this </div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s1_131">is nothing. I would like to pour my heart, I would like to pour my whole </div>
