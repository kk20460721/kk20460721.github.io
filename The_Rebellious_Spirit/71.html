<div id="t1_71" class="t s1_71">CHAPTER 7. ARGUING WITH THE OCEAN</div>
<div id="t2_71" class="t s2_71">The friend said, ”I am feeling compassion for all those people who are outside the wall. The whole</div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s2_71">world is mad. Only a very few people who are not mad have been kept in the madhouse, just for</div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s2_71">security reasons. Who allowed you in? We are not mad, and we don’t need your compassion.”</div>
<div id="t5_71" class="t s2_71">I have visited many mad asylums, but I have never found a single man who would accept that he</div>
<div id="t6_71" class="t s2_71">was mad; because to accept that you are mad means that you are sane enough even to see your</div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s2_71">own madness.</div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s2_71">The question is asked by Vimal – and just nearby is sitting Narendra.</div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s2_71">His father had a strange</div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s2_71">disease: six months he used to be mad and six months he used to be sane – a great balance of</div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s2_71">enjoying both worlds. Whenever he was sane he was always sick, always grumpy. He would lose</div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s2_71">weight, and he would fall victim to all kinds of infection; all his resistance to disease would be lost.</div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s2_71">And in the six months when he was mad, he was the healthiest person you could ﬁnd – no disease,</div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s2_71">no infection – and he was always happy.</div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s2_71">The family was in trouble. Whenever he was happy the family was in trouble, because his happiness</div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s2_71">was a certain indication that he was mad. If he was not going to the doctors, if he was enjoying his</div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s2_71">health – he was mad.</div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s2_71">While he was insane, he would get up early in the morning, four o’clock, and wake up the whole</div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s2_71">neighborhood saying, ”What are you doing?</div>
<div id="tk_71" class="t s2_71">Just go for a morning walk, go to the river, enjoy</div>
<div id="tl_71" class="t s2_71">swimming. What are you doing here in bed?”</div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s2_71">The whole neighborhood was tortured... but he enjoyed it. He would purchase fruits and sweets and</div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s2_71">say, ”You can come to my shop and get your money.” Naturally – Narendra was very small, his other</div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s2_71">brothers were even smaller – even the smallest children were watching him, that he does not steal</div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s2_71">the money. But whether they watched or not, he would go on distributing fruits and sweets to people</div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s2_71">and saying to them, ”Rejoice! Why are you sitting so sad?” Naturally, they had to pay money to all</div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s2_71">kinds of people.</div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s2_71">It was a very strange situation. Children steal money, and fathers, grandfathers, prevent them. In</div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s2_71">Narendra’s house, the situation was just the opposite: the father used to steal money, and the small</div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s2_71">children would shout for the mother: ”He is taking money again!”</div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s2_71">And by the time the mother was there, he was gone – gone to the market to purchase sweets,</div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s2_71">fruits, or anything whatsoever, wholesale! He was not concerned with small things – just wholesale</div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s2_71">purchase and distributing. And everybody loved it, but everybody was tortured, also.</div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s2_71">Once it happened that he escaped while he was insane. He had just gone to the station, and the</div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s2_71">train was there, so he sat in the train. One thing just led to another... and he reached Agra.</div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s2_71">In India there is a sweet; its name is such that it can create trouble, and it created trouble for him.</div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s2_71">He was feeling hungry, so he went to a shop and he asked what it was, and the man said, ”Khaja.”</div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s2_71">Khaja in Hindi means two things: it is the name of that sweet, and it also means, ”Eat it”... so he ate</div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s2_71">it.</div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s2_71">The man could not believe it. He said, ”What are you doing?”</div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s2_71">The Rebellious Spirit</div>
<div id="t16_71" class="t s2_71">71</div>
<div id="t17_71" class="t s3_71">Osho</div>
