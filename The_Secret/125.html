<div id="t1_125" class="t s1_125">CHAPTER 7. THESE LETTERS HAVE NO MEANING</div>
<div id="t2_125" class="t s2_125">There are many people – and they are very respectable people, because people think they are doing</div>
<div id="t3_125" class="t s2_125">something great; philosophers, thinkers, theologians – they are simply wasting their life, and wasting</div>
<div id="t4_125" class="t s2_125">it to no purpose. They go on seeking and searching for meaning in words, they become very very</div>
<div id="t5_125" class="t s2_125">skillful about words, but all that they know are words. Their words are empty.</div>
<div id="t6_125" class="t s2_125">THIS MAN HAD SPENT MANY YEARS TRYING, TO PUZZLE OUT MEANINGS...</div>
<div id="t7_125" class="t s2_125">Once a man came to me.</div>
<div id="t8_125" class="t s2_125">For thirty years he had been searching into the lives of Buddha and</div>
<div id="t9_125" class="t s2_125">Mahavira for only one single thing – who was older?</div>
<div id="ta_125" class="t s2_125">They both were contemporaries, and the</div>
<div id="tb_125" class="t s2_125">records are puzzling and confusing because the people of those days were not much interested in</div>
<div id="tc_125" class="t s2_125">records. They were not interested in the so-called history at all. Their interest was far deeper. They</div>
<div id="td_125" class="t s2_125">were not interested in the personality of Buddha, his body, where he was born, the exact date, et</div>
<div id="te_125" class="t s2_125">cetera. They were more interested in what had happened in his consciousness. Their records are</div>
<div id="tf_125" class="t s2_125">very accurate as far as Buddha’s enlightenment is concerned, but their records about his physical</div>
<div id="tg_125" class="t s2_125">birth, his physical death, how long he really lived, are just very confusing.</div>
<div id="th_125" class="t s2_125">So is the case with Mahavira: there are records which say Mahavira was older; and it can be proved</div>
<div id="ti_125" class="t s2_125">that he was older because he never mentions Buddha. But Buddha criticized Mahavira many times.</div>
<div id="tj_125" class="t s2_125">That means Mahavira must have been very old, already respected, recognized. Buddha must have</div>
<div id="tk_125" class="t s2_125">been very young and he had to ﬁght his way. He must have criticized Mahavira. Mahavira must have</div>
<div id="tl_125" class="t s2_125">kept silent, because who bothers about a young man? Let him speak, it doesn’t matter. But there</div>
<div id="tm_125" class="t s2_125">are books which say that Buddha was older and Mahavira was younger; they can also prove it.</div>
<div id="tn_125" class="t s2_125">Proofs are very easy. The same thing can be used to prove just the opposite, and the same thing</div>
<div id="to_125" class="t s2_125">has been used.</div>
<div id="tp_125" class="t s2_125">Those who think that Buddha was older say that he was angry with Mahavira because he was</div>
<div id="tq_125" class="t s2_125">younger and was trying to convert his disciples; that’s why he was angry and he criticized Mahavira.</div>
<div id="tr_125" class="t s2_125">Mahavira did not bother. Who bothers about an old man? ”He will be here just a few days, and</div>
<div id="ts_125" class="t s2_125">gone.” He went on working on his own. And he had all to gain, because he had no disciples that</div>
<div id="tt_125" class="t s2_125">Buddha could take away, but he could take away Buddha’s disciples. Buddha must have been angry.</div>
<div id="tu_125" class="t s2_125">That is how people go on thinking. Both kinds of people miss. They don’t understand either Mahavira</div>
<div id="tv_125" class="t s2_125">or Buddha, because neither could Mahavira be angry nor could Buddha be angry. And neither of</div>
<div id="tw_125" class="t s2_125">them could be interested in converting others’ disciples. But this is how scholars think. That is their</div>
<div id="tx_125" class="t s2_125">mind that comes in. It says something about the so-called scholars and the historians.</div>
<div id="ty_125" class="t s2_125">This man who came to me, for thirty years – he was a well-known man, had written many books,</div>
<div id="tz_125" class="t s2_125">particularly on Mahavira and Buddha – his whole problem was how to decide who was older. He</div>
<div id="t10_125" class="t s2_125">asked me, ”Can you shed some light on this problem, who was older?”</div>
<div id="t11_125" class="t s2_125">I said, ”That is just rubbish to bother about. Why should I waste my time on who was older? And</div>
<div id="t12_125" class="t s2_125">how does it matter in any way? It is not going to affect what Buddha was, whether he was three</div>
<div id="t13_125" class="t s2_125">years older than Mahavira or ten years younger. Neither is it going to affect Mahavira’s vision. But</div>
<div id="t14_125" class="t s2_125">why have you wasted thirty years? Your thirty years have just gone down the drain. And if some day</div>
<div id="t15_125" class="t s2_125">you come across Buddha and Mahavira, they will laugh. They will say, ’You are a fool! Why have</div>
<div id="t16_125" class="t s2_125">you wasted your thirty years? And you are getting old; any day you will die – when are you going to</div>
<div id="t17_125" class="t s2_125">become a Buddha on your own?’”</div>
<div id="t18_125" class="t s2_125">The Secret</div>
<div id="t19_125" class="t s2_125">125</div>
<div id="t1a_125" class="t s3_125">Osho</div>
