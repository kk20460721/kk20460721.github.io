<div id="t2_73" class="t s1_73">makes one a buddha, he should not teach. </div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s1_73">FIRST ESTABLISH YOURSELF IN THE WAY, THEN TEACH, AND SO DEFEAT </div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s1_73">SORROW. Otherwise this happens: listening to a buddha, his beautiful teachings, you </div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s1_73">become so full of the teachings that a great desire arises to teach others. You forget </div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s1_73">completely that first you have to practice before you can preach. That's how it is </div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s1_73">happening all over the world. </div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s1_73">Once I was taken to a Christian college, one of the biggest in India, where they create </div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s1_73">missionaries, ministers, priests, etcetera. I was a little puzzled: how can you create </div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s1_73">priests, ministers, missionaries in a college? That is impossible. The principal was very </div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s1_73">much interested in me; he invited me. He said, "Come and see!" </div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s1_73">It was a six-year course, and I looked around the college, a big campus -- seven hundred </div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s1_73">people were getting ready to become priests, preachers, teachers -- I looked around, </div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s1_73">went into many classes, and what I saw was really hilarious. It was so ridiculous. </div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s1_73">In one class the teacher was telling the students, "When you give this sermon, this is </div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s1_73">how you have to stand, and when you come to this point, this is how you have to raise </div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s1_73">your hand, these are the gestures you make, this is how you have to close you eyes -- as </div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s1_73">if you have gone into a deep deep meditation</div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s1_73">....</div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s1_73">" As if -- don't forget the "as if." They </div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s1_73">were learning like actors. </div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s1_73">In Poona there is a film institute where they prepare actors; that I can understand -- </div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s1_73">acting can be taught. Even there I have never heard that film institutes have created </div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s1_73">great actors, but one can understand that acting can be taught, even though great actors </div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s1_73">have not been created by film institutes. Even there it fails. </div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s1_73">Actors are also born like poets, because acting is poetry, it is art; you have to have an </div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s1_73">inborn spirit. Not everybody can be an actor, because one has to get so much involved </div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s1_73">in the act, so deeply involved, that one forgets that one is separate. One has to lose one's </div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s1_73">identity in the acting, one has to become one's part; one has to forget everything about </div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s1_73">oneself. This is no ordinary feat. One can think that acting can be taught -- but how can </div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s1_73">you teach people to become masters? </div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s1_73">Taking leave of the principal I told him one story: </div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s1_73">"I have heard -- it must have happened in some college like yours -- the teacher was </div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s1_73">telling the students, 'When you talk about paradise, heaven, smile a heavenly smile, </div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s1_73">your eyes full of joy and light, and look upwards towards heaven. And for a moment </div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s1_73">become silent and just let people see how joyous, full of light and joy you are.' </div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s1_73">"A student raised his hand and he said, 'That's right, but when we are talking about </div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s1_73">hell, what to do?' </div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s1_73">"The teacher said, 'Then just as you are will do -- just stand as you are. You need not do </div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s1_73">anything else, just be yourself, that's all, and that will show them what hell is.'" </div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s1_73">Teaching people to become masters is such an absurdity. Jesus did not learn in any </div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s1_73">college. It is fortunate that such colleges did not exist in those days; otherwise they </div>
<div id="t17_73" class="t s1_73">might have destroyed Jesus. Buddha never went to any religious institution to learn. </div>
<div id="t18_73" class="t s1_73">Religion has to be lived, because that is the only way to learn it. </div>
