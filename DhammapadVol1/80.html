<div id="t2_80" class="t s1_80">repress; you cannot go on screaming there. </div>
<div id="t3_80" class="t s1_80">Then the scream gathers, then the steam gathers. Then one day you have to go into the </div>
<div id="t4_80" class="t s1_80">group again. This is a temporary relief; good as far as it goes, but it cannot make you a </div>
<div id="t5_80" class="t s1_80">buddha. That's where this commune is different from institutes like Esalen. They end </div>
<div id="t6_80" class="t s1_80">with groups -- we begin with groups. Where they end, that's exactly the point from </div>
<div id="t7_80" class="t s1_80">where we begin. </div>
<div id="t8_80" class="t s1_80">And it is not a coincidence that thousands of therapists have become interested in my </div>

<div id="ta_80" class="t s1_80">....</div>
<div id="tb_80" class="t s1_80">Among my sannyasins, the greatest group from any </div>
<div id="tc_80" class="t s1_80">profession is that of psychotherapists. A great need is felt now all over the world that </div>
<div id="td_80" class="t s1_80">encounter, primal therapy, gestalt, can help a little bit to unburden people, but they </div>
<div id="te_80" class="t s1_80">cannot help to make them buddhas -- they cannot help them to become awakened. </div>
<div id="tf_80" class="t s1_80">Indulgence creates habit, repression gathers the poison within. In indulgence you throw </div>
<div id="tg_80" class="t s1_80">the poison on others, but they are not going to remain silent -- they will throw it back. It </div>
<div id="th_80" class="t s1_80">becomes a match: you throw your anger on others, they throw their anger on you -- but </div>
<div id="ti_80" class="t s1_80">nobody is helped, everybody is harmed and hurt. </div>
<div id="tj_80" class="t s1_80">And if you repress</div>
<div id="tk_80" class="t s1_80">....</div>
<div id="tl_80" class="t s1_80">Because of this futility of indulgence, priests invented repression. </div>
<div id="tm_80" class="t s1_80">It keeps you out of danger. Repression keeps you a good citizen, a gentleman. It keeps </div>
<div id="tn_80" class="t s1_80">you out of the dangers of getting caught by the law, getting caught into enmity; it keeps </div>
<div id="to_80" class="t s1_80">you smooth. Repression helps you to become a better social person, that's true. But it </div>
<div id="tp_80" class="t s1_80">makes you a wound inside, just a wound, and the pus goes on gathering inside. Outside </div>
<div id="tq_80" class="t s1_80">it functions as a lubricating agent, but inside you become more and more mad. </div>
<div id="tr_80" class="t s1_80">If this society and this century are the maddest in the whole history, the credit goes to </div>
<div id="ts_80" class="t s1_80">the past. Five thousand years of saintly advice to people -- the credit goes to those </div>
<div id="tt_80" class="t s1_80">saints. If people are becoming mad, if people are becoming insane, if people are </div>
<div id="tu_80" class="t s1_80">committing suicide, if people are becoming murderous, the credit certainly goes to all </div>
<div id="tv_80" class="t s1_80">your so-called saints, priests, preachers, leaders. They are responsible for it. </div>
<div id="tw_80" class="t s1_80">Just the other day I was telling you the Canadian government wants to investigate, </div>
<div id="tx_80" class="t s1_80">make a deep investigation of this commune because one American citizen who was a </div>
<div id="ty_80" class="t s1_80">sannyasin has committed suicide, and another American who was a sannyasin has gone </div>
<div id="tz_80" class="t s1_80">mad too. Now, I wonder: the person who has committed suicide was sixty years old. He </div>
<div id="t10_80" class="t s1_80">has been a Christian for sixty years, but Christianity is not investigated. And he has </div>
<div id="t11_80" class="t s1_80">been a sannyasin for not even sixty days! The credit goes to Christianity, not to me. </div>
<div id="t12_80" class="t s1_80">The man who went mad was a Protestant. Now, I am condemned because he was a </div>
<div id="t13_80" class="t s1_80">sannyasin, but the Protestant church is not condemned. And he was brought up as a </div>
<div id="t14_80" class="t s1_80">Protestant, he lived as a Protestant for thirty-five years, and for just a few days he was a </div>
<div id="t15_80" class="t s1_80">sannyasin. Now, American society is not condemned. </div>
<div id="t16_80" class="t s1_80">This is strange logic...and I am trying to help people. When he had come here, he was </div>
<div id="t17_80" class="t s1_80">already mad. He has come here after six years of psychoanalysis; because </div>
<div id="t18_80" class="t s1_80">psychoanalysis could not help him he had come here and became a sannyasin. Because </div>
<div id="t19_80" class="t s1_80">the Protestant church and the priests could not help him, he had come here and become </div>
<div id="t1a_80" class="t s1_80">a sannyasin. But they had done such a good job that it was difficult to bring him back </div>
