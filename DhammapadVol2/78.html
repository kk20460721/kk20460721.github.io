<div id="t1_78" class="t s1_78">Niranjana is such a small river, and it was not the rainy season, but he could not cross, </div>
<div id="t2_78" class="t s1_78">he could not swim the river. He must have been utterly weak. </div>
<div id="t3_78" class="t s1_78">That day, a great revelation happened to him: "I have been doing unnecessary violence </div>
<div id="t4_78" class="t s1_78">to myself." He had five followers; they were all ascetics and they had become followers </div>
<div id="t5_78" class="t s1_78">of Buddha because he was far ahead of them. They could only do so much, but he was </div>
<div id="t6_78" class="t s1_78">doing many times more; hence they were followers. That evening Buddha decided, "It is </div>
<div id="t7_78" class="t s1_78">stupid to torture the body, and how can you attain to the soul by torturing the body? </div>
<div id="t8_78" class="t s1_78">There seems to be no logical relationship." And he saw, "If I cannot even cross the river, </div>
<div id="t9_78" class="t s1_78">the poor river Niranjana, how am I going to cross this huge ocean of the world? The </div>
<div id="ta_78" class="t s1_78">body needs food, the body needs nourishment, the body needs strength, so that I can </div>
<div id="tb_78" class="t s1_78">meditate, so that I can contemplate, so that I can inquire, with zest, enthusiasm, energy." </div>
<div id="tc_78" class="t s1_78">He decided to drop all austerities. His five disciples immediately left him. They said, </div>
<div id="td_78" class="t s1_78">"Gautam has fallen from his holy state, he is no longer a saint." They left him </div>
<div id="te_78" class="t s1_78">immediately; they were not with HIM. They were only with him because of his </div>
<div id="tf_78" class="t s1_78">masochistic life-style -- they must have been masochists themselves. </div>
<div id="tg_78" class="t s1_78">And Gautam Buddha became enlightened the next day. Dropping all austerities, </div>
<div id="th_78" class="t s1_78">dropping all that unnecessary inner conflict, that civil war, he became so quiet, so silent, </div>
<div id="ti_78" class="t s1_78">that the next morning he could see, he became perceptive. In his silence, all turmoil, all </div>
<div id="tj_78" class="t s1_78">chattering was dissolved. In the early morning as the sun was rising, he started rising </div>
<div id="tk_78" class="t s1_78">within his being. He was awakened, he became a buddha. </div>
<div id="tl_78" class="t s1_78">Virtue came out of silence, out of meditativeness, out of relaxation -- not out of effort, </div>
<div id="tm_78" class="t s1_78">not out of tension, not out of struggle. He went in search of his five old followers to give </div>
<div id="tn_78" class="t s1_78">them the message: "Don't torture yourselves anymore. This has nothing to do with </div>
<div id="to_78" class="t s1_78">holiness. This has nothing to do with religion." </div>
<div id="tp_78" class="t s1_78">Meditation has to happen first, then character comes as a shadow to it. And if </div>
<div id="tq_78" class="t s1_78">meditation does not happen, then your character is just a hypocrisy and nothing else. </div>
<div id="tr_78" class="t s1_78">Your saints are great hypocrites; they say one thing, they think another, maybe just the </div>
<div id="ts_78" class="t s1_78">opposite. They do one thing, but they want to do something exactly the opposite. On </div>
<div id="tt_78" class="t s1_78">the surface they show one thing, but deep down they are just its contrary. </div>
<div id="tu_78" class="t s1_78">A girl confesses that she let her boyfriend put his hand on her knee. "And is that ALL he </div>
<div id="tv_78" class="t s1_78">did?" asks the priest. </div>
<div id="tw_78" class="t s1_78">"No. He slid his finger under the elastic of my panties too." </div>
<div id="tx_78" class="t s1_78">"And then what?" </div>
<div id="ty_78" class="t s1_78">"And then he spread open my fuzz and began to tickle my doo-funny." </div>
<div id="tz_78" class="t s1_78">"And then? And then?" </div>
<div id="t10_78" class="t s1_78">"And then my mother walked in." </div>
<div id="t11_78" class="t s1_78">"Oh shit!" says the priest. </div>
<div id="t12_78" class="t s1_78">These priests, these saints, they are far more ugly than you are, far more ugly than you </div>
<div id="t13_78" class="t s1_78">ever can be, because they are far more split, divided. They are so much repressed that </div>
<div id="t14_78" class="t s1_78">their conscious and unconscious have fallen apart. They preach one thing, they practice </div>
