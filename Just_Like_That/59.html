<div id="t2_59" class="t s2_59">the list, it was said that his wife was dead. Of course his wife was very furious, and she was more</div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s2_59">furious because Nasruddin was taking the thing with much ease. He was not disturbed and he was</div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s2_59">not angry, and he should have been because how dare these people count her as dead when she</div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s2_59">was alive? She was very angry. They went to the commissioner and she told him, ”This is not right.</div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s2_59">I am alive! And in your list it is said that I am dead. What is this?”</div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s2_59">She was so angry that Nasruddin said, ”Wait. You cannot ﬁght with the ofﬁcers. They must be right;</div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s2_59">how can they be wrong? Of course they know better than we do, and you, a foolish woman, not</div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s2_59">educated at all, trying to argue with a great ofﬁcer? If they write that you are dead, you must be</div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s2_59">dead. Experts cannot be wrong.”</div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s2_59">BUT I AM ALIVE! SHOUTED THE MAN.</div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s2_59">And life is shouting all around you, but you have never listened to it.</div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s2_59">You are too engaged with</div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s2_59">experts. You go on reading your Ramayana, your Bible, and life is all around shouting, ”I am here!</div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s2_59">Look at me!” It shouts through the birds, through the trees, through the rocks, through the clouds –</div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s2_59">but you are deaf. Your ears are ﬁlled with the scriptures and the experts and the theoreticians. You</div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s2_59">are reading your book, you are looking in the book, you are searching for life in the book.</div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s2_59">Ramakrishna used to say that it happened: The wife of a disciple of Ramakrishna told her husband</div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s2_59">that in the neighborhood, just two or three houses away, a house had burned down in the night.</div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s2_59">He was an educated man. Immediately he took his newspaper and went through it. The wife said,</div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s2_59">”What are you doing?” He said, ”If the house has really burned down then there must be news of it</div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s2_59">in the newspaper, and it is not there. I don’t think that house could have burned down, it must be a</div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s2_59">rumor.” Just three houses away – but you have to look in the newspaper, you have to check in the</div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s2_59">newspaper. The newspaper has become more alive than life. Words have become more meaningful</div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s2_59">than facts.</div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s2_59">Existence has gone far away from you. Between you and existence there is a vast wall of China,</div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s2_59">made of words, theories, scriptures, religions, philosophies. It is difﬁcult to penetrate the wall and</div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s2_59">reach existence; that’s why you are so miserable, so thirsty, so starved. You have not lived at all.</div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s2_59">You have been just dragging.</div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s2_59">BUT I AM ALIVE! SHOUTED THE MAN. HE APPEALED TO A WELL KNOWN AND IMPARTIAL</div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s2_59">SCIENTIST AND JURISPRUDENT WHO WAS PRESENT.</div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s2_59">There he also committed the same mistake as the mourners were committing, because he also</div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s2_59">belonged to the same crowd. Sometimes I think, reading this story, that he may also be thinking</div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s2_59">inside: Maybe they are right, because how can the experts be wrong?</div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s2_59">Maybe I am deceived!...</div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s2_59">because he was part of these mourners, of the same crowd.</div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s2_59">He was not a different man but a</div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s2_59">member of the same group. He must also be thinking inside: I feel that I am alive, but who relies on</div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s2_59">his own feelings? You also don’t rely on your own feelings. You feel suspicious. Who knows? – you</div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s2_59">may be wrong. The man was alive, he was feeling alive, he was shouting, ”I am alive!” but still he</div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s2_59">appealed to the wrong man – a well known and impartial scientist.</div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s2_59">First, he was a scientist, which means he was an expert about dead things.</div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s2_59">No scientist ever</div>
<div id="t18_59" class="t s2_59">encounters life, he cannot.</div>
<div id="t19_59" class="t s2_59">His methodology debars it.</div>
<div id="t1a_59" class="t s2_59">A man who knows about dead things –</div>
<div id="t1b_59" class="t s2_59">Just Like That</div>
<div id="t1c_59" class="t s2_59">59</div>
