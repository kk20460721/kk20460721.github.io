<div id="t1_123" class="t s1_123">Just the other day, a French couple wrote a letter to me. They must be new arrivals here, </div>
<div id="t2_123" class="t s1_123">they don't understand me. They must have come with certain prejudices. They were </div>
<div id="t3_123" class="t s1_123">worried, very much worried. They wrote in the letter that, "We don't understand a few </div>
<div id="t4_123" class="t s1_123">things. Why does this ashram look luxurious? This is against spirituality. Why do you </div>
<div id="t5_123" class="t s1_123">drive in a beautiful car? This is against spirituality." </div>
<div id="t6_123" class="t s1_123">Now, for these three or four days I have been driving in an Impala. It is not a very </div>
<div id="t7_123" class="t s1_123">beautiful car; in America it is the car of the plumbers! But in a sense I am also a plumber </div>
<div id="t8_123" class="t s1_123">-- the plumber of the mind. I fix nuts and bolts. It is a poor man's car. In America, the </div>
<div id="t9_123" class="t s1_123">people who use Chevrolet Impalas, etcetera, their neighborhood is called the Chevrolet </div>
<div id="ta_123" class="t s1_123">neighborhood -- that means poor people's neighborhood. </div>
<div id="tb_123" class="t s1_123">But this French couple must have the old idea that poverty has something spiritual </div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s1_123">about it. Man has lived so long in poverty that he HAD to console himself, otherwise it </div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s1_123">would have been intolerable. He had to convince himself that poverty is spiritual. </div>
<div id="te_123" class="t s1_123">Poverty is not spiritual -- poverty is the source of all crimes. </div>
<div id="tf_123" class="t s1_123">And I would like to tell the couple that, "If you want to cling to your beliefs and </div>
<div id="tg_123" class="t s1_123">prejudices, this is not the place for you. Please get lost! -- the sooner the better, because </div>
<div id="th_123" class="t s1_123">you may be corrupted here. Listening to me is dangerous for you." </div>
<div id="ti_123" class="t s1_123">To me, spirituality has a totally different dimension. It is the ultimate luxury -- when </div>
<div id="tj_123" class="t s1_123">you have all and suddenly you see that, although you have all, deep inside there is a </div>
<div id="tk_123" class="t s1_123">vacuum which has to be filled, an emptiness which has to be transformed into a </div>
<div id="tl_123" class="t s1_123">plenitude. One becomes aware of the inner emptiness only when one has everything on </div>
<div id="tm_123" class="t s1_123">the outside. Science can do that miracle. I love science, because it can create the </div>
<div id="tn_123" class="t s1_123">possibility for religion to happen. </div>
<div id="to_123" class="t s1_123">Up to now, religion has not happened on the earth. We have talked about religion but it </div>
<div id="tp_123" class="t s1_123">has not happened; it has not touched the hearts of the millions. Only once in a while a </div>
<div id="tq_123" class="t s1_123">person has been able to become enlightened. In a big garden where millions of bushes </div>
<div id="tr_123" class="t s1_123">and trees are, if only once in a while in thousands of years a flower comes to a tree, you </div>
<div id="ts_123" class="t s1_123">will not call it a garden. You will not be thankful to the gardener. You will not say, "The </div>
<div id="tt_123" class="t s1_123">gardener is great, because look: after one thousand years, out of millions of trees, one </div>
<div id="tu_123" class="t s1_123">tree has again blossomed with one flower." If this happens that simply shows it must </div>
<div id="tv_123" class="t s1_123">have happened in spite of the gardener! Somehow he has forgotten about the tree, </div>
<div id="tw_123" class="t s1_123">somehow he has neglected the tree, somehow the tree has escaped his grip. </div>
<div id="tx_123" class="t s1_123">Man has lived irreligiously: talking about God, certainly -- going to the church, to the </div>
<div id="ty_123" class="t s1_123">temple, to the mosque -- yet his life showing no flavor of religion. </div>
<div id="tz_123" class="t s1_123">My vision of religion is totally different. It has nothing to do with poverty. I would like </div>
<div id="t10_123" class="t s1_123">the whole earth to become as rich as paradise -- richer than paradise -- so that people </div>
<div id="t11_123" class="t s1_123">can stop thinking about paradise. Paradise was created by poor people just to console </div>
<div id="t12_123" class="t s1_123">themselves that, "Here we are suffering, but it is not for long. Only a few days more, or </div>
<div id="t13_123" class="t s1_123">a few years, and death will come and we will be transported into paradise." And what a </div>
<div id="t14_123" class="t s1_123">consolation! -- that those who are rich here will be thrown into hell. </div>
<div id="t15_123" class="t s1_123">Jesus says a camel can pass through the eye of the needle, but the rich man cannot pass </div>
<div id="t16_123" class="t s1_123">through the gate of heaven. What consolation! The poor people must have felt very </div>
<div id="t17_123" class="t s1_123">satisfied, contented, that, "It is only a question of a few days more: then you will be in </div>
