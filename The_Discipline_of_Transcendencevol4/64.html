<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">hope she will do it. Within a few days many contacts will be made with the </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">center, and then you will understand what I mean when I go on repeating again </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">and again that that which you are seeking is already in you. It is not in the future. </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">It has nothing to do with the future. It is already herenow, it is already the case. </div>

<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">WHY IS IT THAT BY GIVING A NAME OR A THEORY TO AN </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">UNCOMFORTABLE, CONFUSING, OR PAINFUL PLACE, I FEEL BETTER? </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">The human ego always feels humiliated when it comes across a fact that it cannot </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">explain. Whenever the human ego comes across a fact that it cannot name, and it </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">has to recognize its ignorance, it feels very offended. That's why people go on </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">labelling things. They are no longer interested in things themselves; they are </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">more interested in labelling. </div>

<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">of it, they don't look at the message of it. They simply start looking as to what </div>

<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">you ask the flower, it cannot say any name to you. It has no identity card, it has </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">no passport; it has no identity. It is simply there; and all names are given by man. </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">And man is really continuously giving names, since the days of Adam. </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">There is a story in the Bible that God created things and he told Adam, "You </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">name it and that will be the name of it"... a beautiful story. So he started naming </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">things. God created the rose, and Adam looked at it and he called it 'rose'. Not </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">that he knew it was a rose -- nobody knows, not even God. God had told Adam </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">to say, and whatsoever he said would be the name. And the names that he has </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">given to things have remained, but they were just accidental. It was a very crazy </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">way to name things, but that was the only way -- because things don't have any </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">name. And man has named many things very wrongly. </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">When God created woman He asked Adam; that was the last thing Adam </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">named. He called her 'Hava' or 'Eva' or 'Eve' or 'Haba'. These were the different </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">pronunciations of what he called her: 'Hava' or 'Haba' or 'Eve'. 'Hava' means life; </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">he called the woman his life. But down through the centuries man has suffered </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">very much; and many times man tried to change the name, but it was too, late. </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">And since then this has been a continuous effort: all that scientists go on doing is </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">just naming things. </div>
