<div id="t1_97" class="t s1_97">change, transform his nonviolence also into a weapon. He can make a weapon out of it, </div>
<div id="t2_97" class="t s1_97">he can start fighting nonviolently. </div>
<div id="t3_97" class="t s1_97">I have heard a story: </div>
<div id="t4_97" class="t s1_97">A young man, a Gandhian, a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, was in love with a woman. </div>
<div id="t5_97" class="t s1_97">The father was very much against him, the woman herself was very much against the </div>
<div id="t6_97" class="t s1_97">man -- she hated even to see his face. But he was determined, he was a man of </div>
<div id="t7_97" class="t s1_97">willpower, and he was very nonviolent. So he did a nonviolent trick. </div>
<div id="t8_97" class="t s1_97">He went to the woman's house, sat at the door and declared that he would fast unto </div>
<div id="t9_97" class="t s1_97">death, unless she married him. A very nonviolent method: fasting unto death. You are </div>
<div id="ta_97" class="t s1_97">not harming anybody. That's what Mahatma Gandhi was doing his whole life: fasting </div>
<div id="tb_97" class="t s1_97">unto death. But is it nonviolence? It is violence, pure violence. Of course you are not </div>
<div id="tc_97" class="t s1_97">destroying the other, you are destroying yourself; but the threat that "I will destroy </div>
<div id="td_97" class="t s1_97">myself," is a threat of violence. And you leave the other absolutely undefended. </div>
<div id="te_97" class="t s1_97">The woman was very much perturbed, disturbed, what to do? If this man dies, she will </div>
<div id="tf_97" class="t s1_97">feel guilty her whole life that she has been the cause of the death of a young man. The </div>
<div id="tg_97" class="t s1_97">father was also very much disturbed. And newspapers were writing and praising the </div>
<div id="th_97" class="t s1_97">young man: how nonviolent he is, how Gandhian he is. The father was getting crazy -- </div>
<div id="ti_97" class="t s1_97">what to do, what not to do? Somebody suggested, "You inquire of some older </div>
<div id="tj_97" class="t s1_97">Gandhian, some method must be there, some antidote." </div>
<div id="tk_97" class="t s1_97">He went to an old Gandhian who told him, "No, don't be worried. I know. You do one </div>
<div id="tl_97" class="t s1_97">thing, a very simple thing." He whispered a secret in his ear and the father was very </div>
<div id="tm_97" class="t s1_97">happy -- and the trick worked. The old Gandhian said, "You go to an old prostitute I </div>
<div id="tn_97" class="t s1_97">know, you tell her to come to your house, sit by the side of the young man, and let her </div>
<div id="to_97" class="t s1_97">declare that 'I am fasting unto death unless this young man marries me.'" </div>
<div id="tp_97" class="t s1_97">And that very night the young man escaped and was never seen again. </div>
<div id="tq_97" class="t s1_97">Nonviolence in the hands of politicians is bound to become violent. It is only a beautiful </div>
<div id="tr_97" class="t s1_97">name for an ugly phenomenon. This is not Buddha's approach, although Gandhians go </div>
<div id="ts_97" class="t s1_97">on declaring that Gandhi is the greatest nonviolent man after Gautam Buddha. He is </div>
<div id="tt_97" class="t s1_97">not; he has no understanding of Buddha and his insight. He is purely and simply a </div>
<div id="tu_97" class="t s1_97">politician. His politics are also very subtle -- his politics are very cunning, devious. But </div>
<div id="tv_97" class="t s1_97">he is not religious at all. His whole approach is political. </div>
<div id="tw_97" class="t s1_97">If you practice nonviolence -- and he practiced it his whole life -- the nonviolence will be </div>
<div id="tx_97" class="t s1_97">false. It cannot be practiced. Anything -- nonviolence, wisdom, silence, love, </div>
<div id="ty_97" class="t s1_97">compassion, joy, none of these beautiful qualities can be practiced. If you practice them </div>
<div id="tz_97" class="t s1_97">you falsify them. They come on their own; all you need to do is to be more and more </div>
<div id="t10_97" class="t s1_97">aware. </div>
<div id="t11_97" class="t s1_97">On the tree of awareness many flowers bloom: the flower of love, the flower of truth, </div>
<div id="t12_97" class="t s1_97">the flower of compassion, the flower of nonviolence. Why? -- because the more you </div>
<div id="t13_97" class="t s1_97">become aware, the less you can believe in the separation. The more you become aware, </div>
<div id="t14_97" class="t s1_97">the less you are an ego. When you become totally aware, you disappear -- you become </div>
