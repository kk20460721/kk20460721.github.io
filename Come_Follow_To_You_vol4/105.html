<div id="tb_105" class="t s1_105">only listen to his words you are bound to misunderstand him. Just listen to his </div>
<div id="tc_105" class="t s1_105">silence, and each of his words is followed by silence. In fact, a man like Jesus </div>
<div id="td_105" class="t s1_105">speaks only so that you can hear his silence. You will say,'Then why does he </div>
