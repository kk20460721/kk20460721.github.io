<div id="t1_324" class="t s1_324">CHAPTER 46.</div>
<div id="t2_324" class="t s2_324">perhaps more. Perhaps he had made the century; in fact, he may have been even more because</div>
<div id="t3_324" class="t s2_324">he tried to reduce his age as much as possible so that he could continue in service a little longer...</div>
<div id="t4_324" class="t s2_324">and he continued.</div>
<div id="t5_324" class="t s2_324">In India you don’t know your birth date, and particularly if you were born one hundred years before,</div>
<div id="t6_324" class="t s2_324">I don’t think there would be any certiﬁcate or record; impossible. But I have never seen a man older</div>
<div id="t7_324" class="t s2_324">than him and yet full of juice, really juicy.</div>
<div id="t8_324" class="t s2_324">He was the only man in that whole school for whom I had some respect – but he was the lowest,</div>
<div id="t9_324" class="t s2_324">nobody even looked at him. Once in a while, just for his sake, I used to visit the school, but I only</div>
<div id="ta_324" class="t s2_324">went to his place.</div>
<div id="tb_324" class="t s2_324">His place was just by the corner of the Elephant Gate. His work was to open and close the gate,</div>
<div id="tc_324" class="t s2_324">and he had a bell hanging in front of his cabin, to hit every forty minutes, leaving just ten minutes</div>
<div id="td_324" class="t s2_324">twice each day for tea breaks, and one hour for lunch. That was his only work, otherwise he was a</div>
<div id="te_324" class="t s2_324">completely free man.</div>
<div id="tf_324" class="t s2_324">I would go into his cabin, and he would close the door so that nobody disturbed us, and so that I</div>
<div id="tg_324" class="t s2_324">could not escape easily. Then he would say, ”Now tell me everything since we met last time.” And</div>
<div id="th_324" class="t s2_324">he was such a lovely old man. His face had so many lines that I had even tried to count them, of</div>
<div id="ti_324" class="t s2_324">course not telling him. I was pretending to listen to him while I was counting how many lines his</div>
<div id="tj_324" class="t s2_324">forehead had – and it was all forehead because all his hair had gone – and how many lines were on</div>
<div id="tk_324" class="t s2_324">his cheeks. In fact his whole face, howsoever you divided it, was nothing but lines. But behind those</div>
<div id="tl_324" class="t s2_324">lines was a man of inﬁnite love and understanding.</div>
<div id="tm_324" class="t s2_324">If I did not visit the school for many days, then it was certain that the day was coming closer when if I</div>
<div id="tn_324" class="t s2_324">didn’t go, then he would come to ﬁnd me. That meant my father would know everything: that I never</div>
<div id="to_324" class="t s2_324">went to school, that attendance was given to me just to keep me out. That was the agreement. I had</div>
<div id="tp_324" class="t s2_324">said, ”Okay, I will keep myself out, but what about my attendance, because who is going to answer</div>
<div id="tq_324" class="t s2_324">my father?”</div>
<div id="tr_324" class="t s2_324">They said, ”Don’t be worried about your attendance.</div>
<div id="ts_324" class="t s2_324">We will give you one hundred percent</div>
<div id="tt_324" class="t s2_324">attendance, even on holidays, so don’t be worried at all.”</div>
<div id="tu_324" class="t s2_324">So I was always aware that before he came to visit my house, it was better to go to his cabin, and</div>
<div id="tv_324" class="t s2_324">somehow – again I have to use the word ”synchronicity” – he knew when I was coming. I knew that if</div>
<div id="tw_324" class="t s2_324">I didn’t go that day he would be coming to inquire what had happened to me. And it became almost</div>
<div id="tx_324" class="t s2_324">mathematically accurate.</div>
<div id="ty_324" class="t s2_324">I would start from the very morning with the feeling, ”Listen” – I am not saying it to you, I am just</div>
<div id="tz_324" class="t s2_324">telling you how I used to get up – ”Listen, if you don’t go today, Mannulal” – that was his name – ”is</div>
<div id="t10_324" class="t s2_324">going to visit by the evening. Before that happens, somehow at least make an appearance before</div>
<div id="t11_324" class="t s2_324">him.”</div>
<div id="t12_324" class="t s2_324">And except once I always followed my inner voice; I mean in concern to Mannulal. Only once... and</div>
<div id="t13_324" class="t s2_324">I was getting a little tired of the whole thing, it was a kind of torture – I had to go. I went out of fear,</div>
<div id="t14_324" class="t s2_324">otherwise he would tell my father and mother, and would create havoc. I said, ”No. Today I’m not</div>
<div id="t15_324" class="t s2_324">going. Whatsoever happens I’m not going.”</div>
<div id="t16_324" class="t s2_324">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t17_324" class="t s2_324">324</div>
<div id="t18_324" class="t s3_324">Osho</div>
