<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">cross, it is the death, that created the guilt. And it created so much guilt that... </div>

<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">master is dead and you have been always denying him, then you worship him: </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">your worship has a fanaticism in it, exhibition in it. You want to prove </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">something. Against whom? Against your own attitudes. </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">I have heard: </div>

<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">sound mind when she made her will six weeks ago.' </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">That's what happens. First you deny a wise man -- that he is wise. You deny that </div>

<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">whole legacy for you, he leaves all his money in your name. He becomes your </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">heritage. Now suddenly things change, things take a one hundred and eighty </div>
