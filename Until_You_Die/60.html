<div id="t1_60" class="t s1_60">CHAPTER 4. STRAIGHT TO FREEDOM</div>
<div id="t2_60" class="t s2_60">should not be given even a glimpse of Bahaudin’s heart, his love, his compassion. Bahaudin must</div>
<div id="t3_60" class="t s2_60">show him a very hard face so he never thinks about Bahaudin again.</div>
<div id="t4_60" class="t s2_60">This was what Gurdjieff was doing to many disciples and they couldn’t understand, because in the</div>
<div id="t5_60" class="t s2_60">West it is difﬁcult to understand. The East has its own ways. Gurdjieff was a Suﬁ: he was taught by</div>
<div id="t6_60" class="t s2_60">many Suﬁ Masters, he moved in many Suﬁ monasteries, he lived with many Suﬁs, and he had the</div>
<div id="t7_60" class="t s2_60">attitude of a Suﬁ. But in the West the understanding is not there; Suﬁ symbols, Suﬁ demonstrations,</div>
<div id="t8_60" class="t s2_60">are not meaningful.</div>
<div id="t9_60" class="t s2_60">I was reading one book written by a disciple of Gurdjieff – a woman, a very talented musician – and</div>
<div id="ta_60" class="t s2_60">she writes that Gurdjieff was angry about something she was told not to do and she had done. He</div>
<div id="tb_60" class="t s2_60">was very angry and he told her: ‘This is the last – never come back again and never come to see</div>
<div id="tc_60" class="t s2_60">me.’ Of course, the woman left him, but she left as a Westerner and missed. She thought: ‘This man</div>
<div id="td_60" class="t s2_60">is not yet Enlightened; otherwise, why is he so angry?’ You judge according to your own criteria.</div>
<div id="te_60" class="t s2_60">‘Why is he so angry? For such an ordinary thing. If I have disobeyed in such a trivial thing, he could</div>
<div id="tf_60" class="t s2_60">have forgiven me! Great Masters are forgiveness, embodied forgiveness. Buddha is compassion,</div>
<div id="tg_60" class="t s2_60">and Jesus forgives even his enemies, the murderers who killed him – he forgives them! And I have</div>
<div id="th_60" class="t s2_60">not committed anything like that. Just a small thing he has said, and I have not followed it – there</div>
<div id="ti_60" class="t s2_60">seems to be no reason to be so angry.’ And she had lived almost for twenty years with Gurdjieff; a</div>
<div id="tj_60" class="t s2_60">disciple of twenty years’ standing simply thrown out and the door closed. And Gurdjieff said, ‘Never</div>
<div id="tk_60" class="t s2_60">see me again. If you want to see me, then only when I am dead.’ The ego was hurt. And she never</div>
<div id="tl_60" class="t s2_60">went to see Gurdjieff again; she went only when he was dead – but she missed.</div>
<div id="tm_60" class="t s2_60">What was Gurdjieff saying?</div>
<div id="tn_60" class="t s2_60">If in the East this had happened, where through a long, long, inner</div>
<div id="to_60" class="t s2_60">disciplehood, an inner discipline of many people, it would have been totally different.</div>
<div id="tp_60" class="t s2_60">What was</div>
<div id="tq_60" class="t s2_60">Gurdjieff saying in fact? He was saying: ‘Either you come to see me dead, or you come to see me</div>
<div id="tr_60" class="t s2_60">when I am dead; otherwise there is no point.’ But that was implied. So she waited for twenty years</div>
<div id="ts_60" class="t s2_60">more, when Gurdjieff died, then she went to pay her homage. She could have been dead herself.</div>
<div id="tt_60" class="t s2_60">That was a situation. Gurdjieff was not angry because she had disobeyed: that anger was creating</div>
<div id="tu_60" class="t s2_60">a situation; that disobedience was just something to hang it upon. Gurdjieff would have been angry</div>
<div id="tv_60" class="t s2_60">whether she had obeyed or disobeyed; that was irrelevant. He would have found something and</div>
<div id="tw_60" class="t s2_60">would have been angry. That was needed: a hard face, very angry, because a person who has Lived</div>
<div id="tx_60" class="t s2_60">with him for twenty years should not be deceived by the surface, should be capable of penetrating</div>
<div id="ty_60" class="t s2_60">deeper, looking into the heart. And in the heart, Gurdjieff was so compassionate, so loving, but he</div>
<div id="tz_60" class="t s2_60">had a very hard shell around him.</div>
<div id="t10_60" class="t s2_60">This woman who was thrown out, if she had a Western attitude... we don’t know, the story says</div>
<div id="t11_60" class="t s2_60">nothing about her, what happened to her; but it will be good to know, in fact, what is possible. If she</div>
<div id="t12_60" class="t s2_60">had a Western attitude – a Western attitude means an egoistic attitude – if she thought that she had</div>
<div id="t13_60" class="t s2_60">been thrown out because she was not worthy, if her ego was hurt, she would miss. If she had an</div>
<div id="t14_60" class="t s2_60">Eastern attitude: If the Master is angry there must be compassion in it, otherwise why should he get</div>
<div id="t15_60" class="t s2_60">angry? If the Master has closed the door there must be meaning in it, because by closing this door</div>
<div id="t16_60" class="t s2_60">some other door is opened. If the Master has said to abandon all spiritual studies and leave his court</div>
<div id="t17_60" class="t s2_60">at once, not even a single moment is to be wasted, that means there is some urgency, urgency in</div>
<div id="t18_60" class="t s2_60">leaving all spiritual studies, the spiritual path, the seeking, everything; there is some urgency. If the</div>
<div id="t19_60" class="t s2_60">attitude had been Eastern, that of a disciple, that of a humble person, that of one who is ready to die,</div>
<div id="t1a_60" class="t s2_60">that woman would have become Enlightened – just at that door, just that moment. But it depends.</div>
<div id="t1b_60" class="t s2_60">Until You Die</div>
<div id="t1c_60" class="t s2_60">60</div>
<div id="t1d_60" class="t s3_60">Osho</div>
