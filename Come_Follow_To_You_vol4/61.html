<div id="t1_61" class="t s1_61">In the West, now there are so many psychotherapies, but nothing is proving to be </div>
<div id="t2_61" class="t s1_61">helpful. Patients go from one psychoanalyst to another, from one therapy to </div>

<div id="t4_61" class="t s1_61">are needed, realized ones are needed who have attained to love. But even in </div>
<div id="t5_61" class="t s1_61">ordinary psychotherapy, if for some moments it happens that the patient is no </div>
<div id="t6_61" class="t s1_61">longer a patient and the therapist is no longer a therapist -- a certain love, a </div>
<div id="t7_61" class="t s1_61">certain humanity; they have forgotten their profession, their professional </div>
<div id="t8_61" class="t s1_61">relationship, and love flows -- healing immediately happens. </div>
<div id="t9_61" class="t s1_61">Healing is a function of love. Love is the greatest therapy, and the world needs </div>
<div id="ta_61" class="t s1_61">therapists because the world lacks love. If people were loving: if parents were </div>
<div id="tb_61" class="t s1_61">loving, if teachers and professors were loving, if the society had a loving climate </div>

<div id="td_61" class="t s1_61">Everybody is born to remain healthy and happy. Everybody is seeking health </div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s1_61">and happiness, but somewhere something is missing and everybody becomes </div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s1_61">miserable. Misery should be an exception; it has become the rule. Happiness </div>
<div id="tg_61" class="t s1_61">should be the rule; it has become an exception. I would like a world where </div>
<div id="th_61" class="t s1_61">buddhas are born, but nobody remembers them because they are the rule. Now </div>
<div id="ti_61" class="t s1_61">Buddha is remembered, Christ is remembered, Lao Tzu is remembered, because </div>
<div id="tj_61" class="t s1_61">they are exceptions. Otherwise, who would bother about them? If there were a </div>

<div id="tl_61" class="t s1_61">you could meet Lao Tzu anywhere, who would bother? Then that would be the </div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s1_61">simple rule. It should be so. </div>
<div id="tn_61" class="t s1_61">Lao Tzu says,'When the world was really moral there was no possibility of </div>
<div id="to_61" class="t s1_61">becoming a saint.' When the world was really religious there was no need for </div>
<div id="tp_61" class="t s1_61">religions. People were simply religious; religions were not needed. When there </div>
<div id="tq_61" class="t s1_61">was order, a discipline, a NATURAL order and discipline, the words 'order' and </div>
<div id="tr_61" class="t s1_61">'discipline' didn't exist. The idea of order comes in only when there is disorder. </div>
<div id="ts_61" class="t s1_61">People start talking about discipline where there is no discipline, and people talk </div>
<div id="tt_61" class="t s1_61">about healing when illness is there. People talk about love when love is missing. </div>

<div id="tx_61" class="t s1_61">therapist but as a human being. Never look at the patient as a patient. Look at </div>
<div id="ty_61" class="t s1_61">him as if he has come to learn something -- a disciple. Help him, but not as an </div>
<div id="tz_61" class="t s1_61">expert; help him like a human being, and there will be much healing. There will </div>
<div id="t10_61" class="t s1_61">be less therapy and much healing. Otherwise, therapy continues for years and </div>
<div id="t11_61" class="t s1_61">years on end, and the result is almost nil. Or, sometimes the result is even </div>
<div id="t12_61" class="t s1_61">harmful. </div>
<div id="t13_61" class="t s1_61">I have heard about one man who had a very curious habit: whenever he was in </div>
<div id="t14_61" class="t s1_61">the pub he would drink wine and always leave a little part in the glass and throw </div>
