<div id="tc_71" class="t s1_71">"I am the last," then the struggle, then the conflict. </div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">I have heard a Sufi parable: </div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">A great emperor, Nadirshah, was praying. It was early morning; the sun had not yet </div>

<div id="tg_71" class="t s1_71">country. Of course he was praying to God for his blessings to be victorious. He was </div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">saying to God, "I am nobody, I am just a servant -- a servant of your servants. Bless me. </div>

<div id="tl_71" class="t s1_71">between him and God. </div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">And then suddenly they heard in the darkness another voice. A beggar of the town was </div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">also praying, and he was saying to God, "I am also nobody, a servant of your servants." </div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">The king said to the priest, "Look at this beggar! He is a beggar and saying to God that 'I </div>

<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">who are you to say that you are the servant of the servants?" </div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">Now you see, the competition is still there, the same competition, the same stupidity. </div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">Nothing has changed. The same calculation: "I have to be the last. Nobody else can be </div>
