<div id="t3_160" class="t s1_160">If you are sad, then be totally sad. Don't be halfhearted in anything. That is a totally </div>
<div id="t4_160" class="t s1_160">different approach towards life. </div>
<div id="t5_160" class="t s1_160">The perfectionist will say, "Never be angry, never be sad." The person who believes in </div>

<div id="tg_160" class="t s1_160">is: the person who can be totally angry can be totally compassionate too, because anger </div>
<div id="th_160" class="t s1_160">will teach him compassion. And sadness will teach him ways of being blissful. </div>
<div id="ti_160" class="t s1_160">My approach is not that of a perfectionist; I am utterly against it. It has destroyed </div>
