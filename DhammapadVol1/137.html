<div id="t1_137" class="t s1_137">The man was waiting for this opportunity. He said, "I want the secret of doing </div>
<div id="t2_137" class="t s1_137">miracles." </div>
<div id="t3_137" class="t s1_137">The master said, "Then why did you waste your time so long? You could have said it </div>
<div id="t4_137" class="t s1_137">the very first day you had come. You tortured yourself and you tortured me too, </div>
<div id="t5_137" class="t s1_137">because I don't like people around me who have motives. They are ugly to look at. They </div>
<div id="t6_137" class="t s1_137">are basically greedy, and greed makes them ugly. The secret is simple -- why didn't you </div>
<div id="t7_137" class="t s1_137">ask me the first day? This is the secret</div>
<div id="t8_137" class="t s1_137">....</div>
<div id="t9_137" class="t s1_137">" </div>
<div id="ta_137" class="t s1_137">He wrote down a small mantra on a piece of paper, just three lines maybe: "Buddham </div>
<div id="tb_137" class="t s1_137">sharanam </div>
<div id="tc_137" class="t s1_137">gachchhami, </div>
<div id="td_137" class="t s1_137">sangham </div>
<div id="te_137" class="t s1_137">sharanam </div>
<div id="tf_137" class="t s1_137">gachchhami, </div>
<div id="tg_137" class="t s1_137">dhammam </div>
<div id="th_137" class="t s1_137">sharanam </div>
<div id="ti_137" class="t s1_137">gachchhami -- I go to the feet of the Buddha, I go to the feet of the Buddha's commune, I </div>
<div id="tj_137" class="t s1_137">go to the feet of the dhamma, the ultimate law." </div>
<div id="tk_137" class="t s1_137">And the master told the man, "You take this small mantra with you, repeat it five times, </div>
<div id="tl_137" class="t s1_137">just five times. It is a simple process. Just remember one condition: while you are </div>
<div id="tm_137" class="t s1_137">repeating it, take a bath, close the door, sit silently -- and while you are repeating it, </div>
<div id="tn_137" class="t s1_137">please don't remember monkeys." </div>
<div id="to_137" class="t s1_137">The man said, "What nonsense are you talking about? Why should I remember </div>
<div id="tp_137" class="t s1_137">monkeys in the first place? I have never remembered them my whole life!" </div>
<div id="tq_137" class="t s1_137">The master said, "That is up to you, but I have to tell you the condition. This is how the </div>
<div id="tr_137" class="t s1_137">mantra was given to me, with this condition. If you have never remembered monkeys, </div>
<div id="ts_137" class="t s1_137">so far so good. Now go home, and please never come back to me. You have the secret, </div>
<div id="tt_137" class="t s1_137">you know the condition. Fulfill the condition and you will have miraculous powers, </div>
<div id="tu_137" class="t s1_137">and whatsoever you want to do you can do: you can fly in the sky, you can read </div>
<div id="tv_137" class="t s1_137">people's thoughts, you can materialize things, and so on and so forth." </div>
<div id="tw_137" class="t s1_137">The man rushed home; he even forgot to thank the master. That's how greed functions: </div>
<div id="tx_137" class="t s1_137">it does not know thankfulness, it does not know gratitude. Greed is absolutely unaware </div>
<div id="ty_137" class="t s1_137">of gratitude; it never comes across it. Greed is a thief and thieves don't thank. </div>
<div id="tz_137" class="t s1_137">The man rushed, but he was very much puzzled: even on the way to his home monkeys </div>
<div id="t10_137" class="t s1_137">started appearing in his head. He saw many kinds of monkeys: small and big, and red-</div>
<div id="t11_137" class="t s1_137">mouthed and black-mouthed, and he was very much puzzled -- "What is happening?" </div>
<div id="t12_137" class="t s1_137">In fact he was not thinking of anything else but the monkeys. And they were becoming </div>
<div id="t13_137" class="t s1_137">bigger and they were crowding all around. </div>
<div id="t14_137" class="t s1_137">He went home, he took a bath, but the monkeys were not leaving him. Now he was </div>
<div id="t15_137" class="t s1_137">becoming suspicious that they were not going to leave him while he would be chanting </div>
<div id="t16_137" class="t s1_137">the mantra. He had not even chanted the mantra yet, he was simply preparing. And </div>
<div id="t17_137" class="t s1_137">when he closed his doors the room was full of monkeys. It was so crowded that he had </div>
<div id="t18_137" class="t s1_137">no space for himself! He closed his eyes and there were monkeys, and he opened his </div>
<div id="t19_137" class="t s1_137">eyes and there were monkeys. He could not believe what was happening! The whole </div>
<div id="t1a_137" class="t s1_137">night he tried. Again and again he would take a bath, and again and again he would try </div>
<div id="t1b_137" class="t s1_137">and fail, and fail utterly. </div>
<div id="t1c_137" class="t s1_137">In the morning he went to the master, returned the mantra and said, "Keep this mantra </div>
<div id="t1d_137" class="t s1_137">with you. This is driving me mad! I don't want to do any miracles, but please help me to </div>
<div id="t1e_137" class="t s1_137">get rid of these monkeys!" </div>
