<div id="t1_22" class="t s1_22">Life trusts only real understanding. Real means your own, authentic, that arises from you. </div>
<div id="t2_22" class="t s1_22">I am not here to give you knowledge, I am not here to give you theories. That's what has </div>
<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">been done for centuries, and man has remained as ignorant as ever. I am here to make </div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">you alert to the fact that hidden behind you, within you, is a source of light. Tap that </div>
<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">source. Let that light bum bright within you. And then you have something alive. Then </div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">whatsoever problems come in life, you will not tackle them from your past knowledge. </div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">You will tackle them in the present. You will face them with your present understanding. </div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">Whatsoever I say will a]ways become past. The moment I have said, the moment you </div>
<div id="t9_22" class="t s1_22">have heard, it has already gone into the past. And life goes on changing; it is a constant </div>
<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">movement. It knows no stopping, it knows no rest. </div>
<div id="tb_22" class="t s1_22">Again and again you will feel confused. </div>
<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">And with me also there is a problem. The next moment you will ask the same question, </div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">and I will never answer the same again. Because I respond. I don't answer, I don't </div>
<div id="te_22" class="t s1_22">remember my old answers -- I respond. Your question is there, I am here, I respond </div>
<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">again. And if you go on collecting my answers: not only confused, you will become mad. </div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">Because you will not find any harmony in them, any consistency in them. They are </div>
<div id="th_22" class="t s1_22">inconsistent. What can I do. Life is inconsistent. If I am to be true to life, I have to remain </div>
<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">inconsistent in my statements. If I want to be true to my statements, then I betray life. </div>
<div id="tj_22" class="t s1_22">And I would like to remain true to life. I can betray my past, but I cannot betray the </div>
<div id="tk_22" class="t s1_22">present. I can go against my statements, but I cannot go against the present life, this </div>
<div id="tl_22" class="t s1_22">moment. </div>
<div id="tm_22" class="t s1_22">So confusion will arise. Some day I will say something, and I will say something else </div>
<div id="tn_22" class="t s1_22">some other day. If you compare, if you try to make a consistent whole out of my </div>
<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">statements, you are going to be in trouble, in deep trouble. Don't do that. You just listen </div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">to me. And don't learn my answer; learn my response. Don't be bothered with what I say. </div>
<div id="tq_22" class="t s1_22">See the way I say it. See the way I respond to a situation, to a question. The answer is not </div>
<div id="tr_22" class="t s1_22">important, but my alive response is. </div>
<div id="ts_22" class="t s1_22">And if you can learn the alive response, you become responsible. My meaning of the </div>
<div id="tt_22" class="t s1_22">word "responsibility" is totally different from the dictionary meaning. In the dictionary </div>
<div id="tu_22" class="t s1_22">responsibility seems something like a duty, a commitment, as if you are responsible to </div>
<div id="tv_22" class="t s1_22">somebody else. The word is almost dirty. The mother goes on saying to the child, "You </div>
<div id="tw_22" class="t s1_22">are responsible to me, remember." The father goes on saying to the son, "You are </div>
<div id="tx_22" class="t s1_22">responsible to me, remember." The society goes on saying to the individuals, "You are </div>
<div id="ty_22" class="t s1_22">responsible to us, to the society, remember." And your so-called images of God, they also </div>
<div id="tz_22" class="t s1_22">go on telling people, "You are responsible to us... to me." </div>
<div id="t10_22" class="t s1_22">When I use the word "responsibility" I mean your aliveness, responding aliveness. You </div>
<div id="t11_22" class="t s1_22">are not responsible to anybody else except your own being, this moment. You are </div>
<div id="t12_22" class="t s1_22">responsible to be responsible. To respond with an open heart, with vulnerability. Not with </div>
<div id="t13_22" class="t s1_22">closed fists but with open hands. Not hiding and holding something. Opening yourself </div>
<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">completely, in deep trust with life. Not trying to be clever and cunning. Then you float </div>
<div id="t15_22" class="t s1_22">with life moment to moment... your response will change because life is changing. </div>
<div id="t16_22" class="t s1_22">Sometimes it is hot and you cannot sit outside in the sun and you would need a shelter. </div>
<div id="t17_22" class="t s1_22">Sometimes it is too cold and you cannot sit under the shelter and you would like to sit </div>
<div id="t18_22" class="t s1_22">under the sun. But nobody is going to say to you that you look very inconsistent: "The </div>
<div id="t19_22" class="t s1_22">other day you were sitting in the shelter, and now you are sitting under the sun? Be </div>
