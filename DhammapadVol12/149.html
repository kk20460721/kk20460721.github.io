<div id="t2_149" class="t s1_149">wanted to know from Bodhidharma, "What is my merit?" </div>
<div id="t3_149" class="t s1_149">The first thing that he asked Bodhidharma was, "I have done so much, what is my </div>
<div id="t4_149" class="t s1_149">merit? What have I gained? What virtue?" </div>
<div id="t5_149" class="t s1_149">Bodhidharma looked at him very sternly. If you have seen Bodhidharma's pictures you </div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s1_149">will be puzzled. He looks more like a lion than like a man -- very fierce; his eyes are </div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s1_149">very penetrating, like swords. He must have cut Wu down to his proper size just by his </div>

<div id="t9_149" class="t s1_149">Wu started trembling, he had never come up against such a man. He had conquered </div>
<div id="ta_149" class="t s1_149">many enemies, he had conquered many dangerous kings, but Bodhidharma was the </div>
<div id="tb_149" class="t s1_149">most dangerous person he had come across. It was a cool morning, but he started </div>
<div id="tc_149" class="t s1_149">perspiring. </div>
<div id="td_149" class="t s1_149">And Bodhidharma said, "Merit? Virtue? You are stupid! Now this is the ego and </div>

<div id="ti_149" class="t s1_149">service to Buddha's religion. You are a beloved of Buddha, you are blessed by Buddha.' </div>
<div id="tj_149" class="t s1_149">But you are saying just the opposite!" </div>
<div id="tk_149" class="t s1_149">Bodhidharma said, "Forget all about those monks! They were buttressing you, they </div>
<div id="tl_149" class="t s1_149">were praising you because they knew that that's what you expected from them. They </div>
<div id="tm_149" class="t s1_149">are cunning and crafty people. They know nothing of Buddha and his message. I am a </div>

<div id="tr_149" class="t s1_149">Bodhidharma said, "No action is holy, because every action arises out of the ego. When </div>
<div id="ts_149" class="t s1_149">you forget all about actions, when you disappear and things start happening on their </div>

<div id="tv_149" class="t s1_149">"Spirituality has nothing to do with doing, spirituality is the fragrance of being, and you </div>
<div id="tw_149" class="t s1_149">are not a being yet. You are still concerned that you have done this, you have done that. </div>
<div id="tx_149" class="t s1_149">"The ego is a doer, your self-nature is a nondoer. Your self-nature simply allows </div>
<div id="ty_149" class="t s1_149">existence to flow through it, it simply allows the ultimate law to function through it. </div>
<div id="tz_149" class="t s1_149">Your self-nature is just a hollow bamboo. In the hands of the ultimate nature it becomes </div>

<div id="t13_149" class="t s1_149">That's why the song can flow through it, it is utterly empty." </div>
