<div id="t1_21" class="t s1_21">listen to the mystic, the theist is afraid of listening to the atheist. From where does all </div>
<div id="t2_21" class="t s1_21">this fear come? Not from the other: it comes from your unconscious. You know </div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">perfectly well -- how can you avoid knowing it? You may like to forget, but you cannot </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">-- it is there! Vaguely you always feel it, the doubt is there, and anybody can provoke it. </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">It may have become dormant, it can become active again; hence the fear of listening to </div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">something that goes against your belief. </div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s1_21">All believers live with closed eyes and closed ears and closed hearts -- they have to, </div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s1_21">because the moment they open their eyes there is fear. Who knows what they are going </div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">to see? It may affect their belief. They cannot listen, they cannot AFFORD to listen, </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">because something may go deep into the unconscious and the unconscious may be </div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s1_21">stirred. And it is with great difficulty that they have been able to control it. But this </div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s1_21">controlled doubt, this repressed doubt, is going to take vengeance, it is going to take </div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">revenge sooner or later. It will wait for an opportunity to assert itself. And it is growing </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">stronger and stronger inside you. Soon it will throw your conscious belief systems. </div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">That's why it is so easy to change people from Hindus to Mohammedans, from </div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s1_21">Mohammedans to Christians, from Christians to Hindus -- it is so easy. </div>
<div id="th_21" class="t s1_21">Before the Russian revolution, just sixty years ago, the whole of Russia was religious -- </div>
<div id="ti_21" class="t s1_21">in fact one of the most religious countries. Then what happened? Just the revolution! </div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">The communists came in power, and within ten years all that religiousness evaporated. </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">People became atheistic because now they were taught in the schools, colleges, </div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s1_21">universities, everywhere, that there is no God, that there is no soul. </div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s1_21">They used to believe in God, now they started believing in no-God! They used to </div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s1_21">believe before, they are STILL believing. Before doubt was repressed, now trust is </div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s1_21">repressed. Sooner or later Russia is going to go through another revolution -- when </div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s1_21">trust will come up again and doubt will be thrown back into the unconscious. But it is </div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">all the same! You are moving in circles. </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">In India, you are great religious people. It is all rubbish. Your so-called religion is </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">nothing but repressed doubt. And that is so in other countries too. </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">This is not the way of inner transformation -- repression is never the way of revolution. </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">Understanding, not repression: try to understand your no, and try to understand your </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">yes, and then you will see they are not separate, they are inseparable. What meaning </div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">can yes have if the word no disappears from languages? What meaning can no have if </div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s1_21">you don't know anything about yes? </div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">They are bound together, married together, they cannot be divorced. But there is a </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">transcendence. There is no need to divorce them, there is no need to separate them -- </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">don't try the impossible. Go beyond. Just watch both. </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">This is my suggestion, Isabel: Watch when doubt arises, don't get identified with it. </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">Don't get disturbed, there is nothing to be disturbed about! Doubt is there -- you are </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">watching it, you are not it. You are just a mirror reflecting it. And when trust arises </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">there will be a little more difficulty in watching because you say, "Trust makes me so </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">happy, trust makes me feel so beautiful." You will jump upon it, you would like to </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">become identified with it. You would like to be known as one who trusts, as one who </div>
<div id="t17_21" class="t s1_21">has faith. But then you will never get out of the vicious circle. Watch trust too. </div>
