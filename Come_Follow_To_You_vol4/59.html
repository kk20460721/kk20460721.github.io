<div id="t1_59" class="t s1_59">talk about it. The very presence of a Buddha, and the loving look from the </div>
<div id="t2_59" class="t s1_59">Master, and the readiness to absorb from the disciple</div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s1_59">....</div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">The word 'patient' is ugly. The word in itself is not ugly; it comes from a very </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">beautiful root. It comes from the same root as 'patience', but it has become ugly </div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s1_59">by association. A disciple is totally different: you have come to learn something, </div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s1_59">not to be treated, and the treatment happens by itself. All therapy is learning. In </div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s1_59">fact, why have you become mentally ill? -- because you have learned something </div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s1_59">wrong. You have learned something so totally wrong that you are caught in it. </div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s1_59">You need somebody who can uncondition you, who can help you to unlearn it </div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s1_59">and channelize your energy in a different path, that's all. </div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s1_59">For example: one woman came to me. I have been watching her for many years; </div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">she has been coming to me for many years. The first time she came she told me </div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s1_59">that she was not interested in sex at all, but her husband was continuously after </div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s1_59">sex. She felt very bad about it; she was almost vomiting.'How to stop it? What </div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s1_59">should I do?' she asked. I talked to the husband and told the husband,'Just for </div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s1_59">one month, don't be interested sexually. After one month, things will be better </div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s1_59">and different.' For one month he followed me. The woman came again. She </div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s1_59">said,'I am feeling very hurt, because my husband is not at all interested in me </div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s1_59">sexually.' Then I told her,'Now, you have to understand what is happening. </div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s1_59">When the husband is sexually interested, you have a certain power over the </div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s1_59">husband. You enjoy that power, but at the same time you also feel that you are </div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s1_59">being used. Because the husband looks at you sexually, that means that he looks </div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s1_59">at you as a means towards a certain satisfaction. You feel that you are being </div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s1_59">used.' Almost all women feel that they are being used, and that is their problem. </div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s1_59">But if the husband stops taking interest they forget all about being used, and they </div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s1_59">become afraid. Then they start thinking that the husband is going far away. Now </div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s1_59">they have no more power over him, they don't possess him. So I told the </div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s1_59">woman,'Just look at the fact: if you want to possess the husband you will have to </div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s1_59">be possessed by him. If you want to possess the husband, then you will have to </div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s1_59">be used by him.' </div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s1_59">A mind which is possessive will be possessed. To possess anything is to be </div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s1_59">possessed by it. The more you possess, the more slavery you create around </div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s1_59">yourself. The freedom comes when you unlearn possessiveness. When you </div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s1_59">unlearn possessiveness, then you are not in search of any power over anybody. </div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s1_59">Then jealousy does not arise. And when you are not trying to possess the other, </div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s1_59">you create such beauty around yourself that the other cannot look at you as a </div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s1_59">thing. You become a person -- glorified, vibrant, illuminated -- you become a </div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s1_59">light unto yourself; nobody can possess you. Whosoever comes near you will feel </div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s1_59">the tremendous beauty, and will not be able to think in terms of your being a </div>
<div id="t15_59" class="t s1_59">thing. </div>
<div id="t16_59" class="t s1_59">Now every woman suffers, because in the first place she wants to possess; when </div>
<div id="t17_59" class="t s1_59">she wants to possess, she is possessed; when she is possessed she feels,'I am </div>
