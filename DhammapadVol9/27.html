<div id="t1_27" class="t s1_27">He didn't attain it, remember. What he attained was hallucinations, visions of hell, </div>
<div id="t2_27" class="t s1_27">demons, etcetera. That was his punishment, so beware of it. </div>
<div id="t3_27" class="t s1_27">How he became enlightened is a totally different story. After three days, when he was </div>
<div id="t4_27" class="t s1_27">tired, utterly tired of his effort, and he saw the frustration, the failure... those six years' </div>
<div id="t5_27" class="t s1_27">continuous torturing himself, and no gain, no success. He had not moved even an inch </div>
<div id="t6_27" class="t s1_27">nearer to truth; he was still where he had started. Only one thing had happened: he had </div>
<div id="t7_27" class="t s1_27">become weaker because he had been fasting. He had become ugly; he had become just </div>
<div id="t8_27" class="t s1_27">bones, all flesh had disappeared. He had become just a skeleton. He looked like he had </div>
<div id="t9_27" class="t s1_27">come out of a grave. No gain, no success... all efforts had failed. </div>
<div id="ta_27" class="t s1_27">Then one evening he saw the futility of human effort. He saw the futility of human ego -</div>
<div id="tb_27" class="t s1_27">- because all efforts are egoistic: "I will attain." The 'I' is always behind all your </div>
<div id="tc_27" class="t s1_27">achievements, desires of achievement. The 'I' is very ambitious: it wants to be successful </div>
<div id="td_27" class="t s1_27">in this world, it wants to be successful in the other world. It wants to have money, it </div>
<div id="te_27" class="t s1_27">wants to have God too. It wants to have power; it wants to have liberation, moksha, </div>
<div id="tf_27" class="t s1_27">truth, nirvana. It wants to have everything. </div>
<div id="tg_27" class="t s1_27">Buddha saw it and in that seeing he dropped that mad effort and he dropped the very </div>
<div id="th_27" class="t s1_27">source of ambition. It was a full-moon night. He laughed at himself, at the whole </div>
<div id="ti_27" class="t s1_27">stupidity of six years. He relaxed, he sat under a tree. For the first time after six years, </div>
<div id="tj_27" class="t s1_27">just sitting not to achieve anything, just sitting, not meditating. Hence in Zen, </div>
<div id="tk_27" class="t s1_27">meditation is called ZAZEN. Zazen means just sitting doing nothing, the spring comes </div>
<div id="tl_27" class="t s1_27">and the grass grows by itself. </div>
<div id="tm_27" class="t s1_27">That evening he sat there under the tree with no desire, because all desires had failed. </div>
<div id="tn_27" class="t s1_27">The worldly desires had failed, the otherworldly desires had failed. </div>
<div id="to_27" class="t s1_27">You will be surprised to know: enlightenment is not a success. Enlightenment happens </div>
<div id="tp_27" class="t s1_27">only when you have totally failed. Enlightenment is born out of total failure -- because if </div>
<div id="tq_27" class="t s1_27">you succeed, the ego remains. When the failure is total, absolute, irrevocable, </div>
<div id="tr_27" class="t s1_27">categorical, when there is no going back, the ego disappears. Ego lives, feeds on success; </div>
<div id="ts_27" class="t s1_27">it cannot live in failure. It leaves you. </div>
<div id="tt_27" class="t s1_27">That evening the ego disappeared. The full moon rose. He watched the full moon, he </div>
<div id="tu_27" class="t s1_27">enjoyed the full moon. For six years he had not seen the moon at all, he was so much </div>
<div id="tv_27" class="t s1_27">preoccupied with his own spiritual attainment. The night was cool and beautiful. The </div>
<div id="tw_27" class="t s1_27">forest was silent, and just by the side was flowing the river Niranjana. He enjoyed the </div>
<div id="tx_27" class="t s1_27">reflection of the moon in the Niranjana. He enjoyed the silence. Then he fell asleep. He </div>
<div id="ty_27" class="t s1_27">slept without any dreams, because all dreams are by-products of desires. </div>
<div id="tz_27" class="t s1_27">In the morning when it was dawn and the birds started singing he was awakened by </div>
<div id="t10_27" class="t s1_27">their songs. Lying under the tree, nowhere to go, nothing to do, he watched the sun rise </div>
<div id="t11_27" class="t s1_27">above the horizon; the east becoming red and a beautiful morning and the cool breeze</div>
<div id="t12_27" class="t s1_27">....</div>
<div id="t13_27" class="t s1_27">And something happened, something clicked. He became enlightened -- not out of six </div>
<div id="t14_27" class="t s1_27">years' effort but only one night's effortlessness. Not out of six years' constant striving of </div>
<div id="t15_27" class="t s1_27">the ego, but only one night's state of no ego, no desire. And in the morning he was </div>
<div id="t16_27" class="t s1_27">enlightened. </div>
<div id="t17_27" class="t s1_27">Then again he laughed. He laughed because he saw that he was always enlightened but </div>
<div id="t18_27" class="t s1_27">could not see the fact, the truth of it, because he was so much concerned with attaining </div>
