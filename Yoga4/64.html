<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">Time is too much in the Western head, too much, and that is creating many </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">tensions inside. Anybody can come and say, 'This is the panacea and everything </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">can be solved within just fifteen minutes.' And what do you do? -- you sit and </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">repeat a mantra. </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">The East has been repeating mantras for millions of years and nothing has </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">happened. And within two weeks of TM training, you become enlightened? </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">These types of stupid things continue because you are in a hurry. Somebody or </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">other will exploit you. </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">I was reading a book the other night, a collection of small essays by Richard </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">Church. The name of the book is A STROLL BEFORE THE DARK. In that book </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">he remembers one incident that happened to one of his friends. </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">A friend who was much too time-obsessed was travelling by train. Suddenly he </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">became aware that he had forgotten his wristwatch, so he was very worried. The </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">train stopped at a small station. The friend looked out of the window as the </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">porter was passing. He asked the porter about the time. The porter said, 'I don't </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">know.' The friend said, 'What! You, a railway man and you don't know what </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">time it is? Don't you have a clock in the station?' The porter said, 'Yes the clock is </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">there. But why should I be distressed with time?' The porter said, 'Why should I </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">be distressed by time? The clock is there; that is none of my business.' </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">It's wonderful, the porter saying, 'Why should I be distressed with time?' People </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">are distressed with time, and in the West much too distressed -- time and time </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">and time. They say that time is money, and time is flowing, going out of the hand </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">continuously, therefore a shortcut is needed. Somebody immediately supplies </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">the demand. </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">Time is not running short. Time is eternal; there is no hurry. Existence moves in a </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">very lethargic way. Existence moves very slowly, just like the Ganges flows in </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">the plains -- slow, as if not flowing at all. Still it reaches the ocean. </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">Time is not short, don't be in a panic. Time is enough. You relax. If you relax, </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">even the longest path will become the short est. If you are in a panic, even the </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">short path will become very long -- because in panic, meditation is impossible. </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">When you are in a panic, in a hurry, the very hurry is the barrier. When I say, </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">'Take the jump' -- and you can take the jump immediately -- I am not talking </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">about shortcuts or longcuts. I am not talking about the way at all, because a jump </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">is not a way. A jump is a courageous moment -- it is a sudden phenomenon. </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">But I don't mean that you can do it right now. I will go on insisting, 'Take the </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">jump immediately, as soon as possible.' This insistence is just to help you to </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">prepare for it. Some day you may be ready. Somebody may be ready right now -- </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">because you are not new; for many lives you have already been working. When I </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">say, 'Take the immediate jump,' there may be someone who has been working </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">for many lives, and just standing on the brink, on the abyss, and afraid. He may </div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s1_64">gather courage and take the jump. Somebody who is very far away, thinking that </div>
<div id="t16_64" class="t s1_64">the immediate jump is possible, will gather hope and start walking. </div>
