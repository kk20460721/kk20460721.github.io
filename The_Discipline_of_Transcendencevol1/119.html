<div id="t2_119" class="t s1_119">love marriage, a very rich family, but the husband was a sort of Don Juan, and he </div>
<div id="t3_119" class="t s1_119">had been betraying his wife in every way possible. Then she committed suicide -- </div>
<div id="t4_119" class="t s1_119">she committed suicide because of him. </div>
<div id="t5_119" class="t s1_119">I was passing through their town so I went to see, because somebody said that </div>
<div id="t6_119" class="t s1_119">the husband was very unhappy. Since the wife had died his life had taken a </div>
<div id="t7_119" class="t s1_119">change. I could not believe it. I thought he should have been happy. It was </div>
<div id="t8_119" class="t s1_119">always a miserable relationship, a continuous conflict was there. </div>
<div id="t9_119" class="t s1_119">I went to see him. He was sitting in his drawing room surrounded by many </div>
<div id="ta_119" class="t s1_119">pictures of his wife -- all around -- as if the wife had become a goddess. And he </div>
<div id="tb_119" class="t s1_119">started crying. I said, 'Stop this nonsense! -- because you were never happy with </div>
<div id="tc_119" class="t s1_119">this woman, she was never happy with you, that's why she has committed </div>
<div id="td_119" class="t s1_119">suicide. That's what you always wanted. In fact you have told me many times </div>
<div id="te_119" class="t s1_119">that if this woman dies you will be free. Now she has done that.' </div>
<div id="tf_119" class="t s1_119">He said, 'But now I feel guilty, as if I have been the cause of her death, as if I have </div>
<div id="tg_119" class="t s1_119">killed her. Now I am not going to ever get married.' </div>
<div id="th_119" class="t s1_119">This is guilt, it is ugly. </div>
<div id="ti_119" class="t s1_119">When a Buddha dies many people worship him. They were there when he was </div>
<div id="tj_119" class="t s1_119">alive, but they never came to him. When a Mahavira dies, for centuries and </div>
<div id="tk_119" class="t s1_119">centuries people go on worshipping. These people were there when Mahavira </div>
<div id="tl_119" class="t s1_119">was alive, but now they feel guilty. </div>
<div id="tm_119" class="t s1_119">Look, Jesus was crucified. At the last moment even his own disciples deserted </div>
<div id="tn_119" class="t s1_119">him; there was nobody to say, 'I am his follower.' Even the last disciple... when </div>
<div id="to_119" class="t s1_119">Jesus was caught, Jesus told him, 'Don't follow me because you will not be able </div>
<div id="tp_119" class="t s1_119">now any more to follow me.' He said, 'I will come, Master. I will go wherever </div>
<div id="tq_119" class="t s1_119">they are taking you.' Jesus said, 'Before the sun rises you will have denied me at </div>
<div id="tr_119" class="t s1_119">least thrice. Don't do it, leave me.' But he insisted. </div>
<div id="ts_119" class="t s1_119">Jesus was caught, the enemies took him, and the disciple followed in the crowd. </div>
<div id="tt_119" class="t s1_119">The crowd became aware that somebody looks like a stranger, and they asked </div>
<div id="tu_119" class="t s1_119">him, 'Who are you? Are you a disciple of Jesus?' He said, 'Who is this Jesus? I </div>
<div id="tv_119" class="t s1_119">have never heard the name.' And thrice, actually thrice before the sun rose, he </div>
<div id="tw_119" class="t s1_119">denied. And when he denied the third time, Jesus looked back and he said, 'Yet </div>
<div id="tx_119" class="t s1_119">the sun has not come over the horizon.' </div>
<div id="ty_119" class="t s1_119">Nobody else must have understood but the disciple must have cried deep down </div>
<div id="tz_119" class="t s1_119">that he has denied Christ -- that he does not know this man, he is a stranger in </div>
<div id="t10_119" class="t s1_119">the town, he is simply coming out of curiosity. At the last moment even the </div>
<div id="t11_119" class="t s1_119">disciples disappeared. Then Jesus was crucified, then disciples gathered, then </div>
<div id="t12_119" class="t s1_119">more disciples gathered, then more and more. Now almost one-third of </div>
<div id="t13_119" class="t s1_119">humanity is Christian. </div>
<div id="t14_119" class="t s1_119">This seems to be a tremendous guilt. Just think, if Jesus was not crucified -- not </div>
<div id="t15_119" class="t s1_119">crucified -- there would have been no Christianity at all. It is not Jesus that has </div>
<div id="t16_119" class="t s1_119">created Christianity, it is the cross. That's why the cross became the symbol of </div>
