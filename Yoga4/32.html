<div id="t1_32" class="t s1_32">disease, indulgence is an imbalance. But to you I don't say this; I say, 'Indulge </div>
<div id="t2_32" class="t s1_32">and be finished with it. Don't carry it in your head. That's worse than doing it.' </div>
<div id="t3_32" class="t s1_32">Indulge! If you want to indulge in food, indulge. Maybe through indulgence you </div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s1_32">will come to your right senses. Maybe through indulgence you will come to a </div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s1_32">ripeness, a maturity that says that it is foolish. </div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s1_32">I remember Gurdjieff reporting that he had a liking for a certain berry type fruit. </div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s1_32">It is found in the Caucasus, and it had always been bad for him. Whenever he </div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s1_32">would take it, his stomach would be disturbed: pains and aches and nausea and </div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s1_32">everything. But he liked the fruit so much that it was impossible not to eat it. </div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s1_32">After a few days he would eat it, again and again. He reports, 'My father went to </div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s1_32">the market one day, took me with him and bought a large quantity of the fruit. I </div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s1_32">was very happy and surprised -- why is he buying them? He has always been </div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s1_32">against it. He had always told me never to eat it. What has happened? What a </div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s1_32">good father!' When Gurdjieff was only nine years old, his father took a stick in </div>
<div id="tf_32" class="t s1_32">his hand and he said, 'You eat the whole lot. Otherwise, I will beat you to death.' </div>
<div id="tg_32" class="t s1_32">And he was a dangerous man. Tears were flowing and Gurdjieff was eating, and </div>
<div id="th_32" class="t s1_32">he had to eat the whole lot. He vomited, but his father was a very, very hard </div>
<div id="ti_32" class="t s1_32">man. He vomited, and for three weeks he was ill with dysentery, vomiting and </div>
<div id="tj_32" class="t s1_32">fever. Then the fruit finished. He said, 'Even now that I am sixty years of age, if I </div>
<div id="tk_32" class="t s1_32">come across the fruit my whole body shakes. I cannot even look at the fruit!' </div>
<div id="tl_32" class="t s1_32">The indulgence created such a deep understanding, to the very roots of the body. </div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s1_32">I say to you, 'Go and indulge.' Nothing is wrong with indulgence. If you really </div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s1_32">indulge and don't withhold yourself, you will come out of it more mature. </div>
<div id="to_32" class="t s1_32">Otherwise, the indulgence, the idea, will always persist -- it will haunt you, it </div>
<div id="tp_32" class="t s1_32">will become a ghost. People who take the vow of celibacy are always haunted by </div>
<div id="tq_32" class="t s1_32">the ghost of sex. People who try to be in any type of control are always haunted </div>
<div id="tr_32" class="t s1_32">by the idea of indulgence, of breaking all bounds, disciplines and controls and </div>
<div id="ts_32" class="t s1_32">running headlong into it. </div>
<div id="tt_32" class="t s1_32">Just allow life to take you wheresoever it leads you and don't be afraid. Fear is </div>
<div id="tu_32" class="t s1_32">the only thing one should be afraid of, nothing else. Move! Be courageous and </div>
<div id="tv_32" class="t s1_32">daring, and I tell you that, by and by, the very experience of indulgence, </div>
<div id="tw_32" class="t s1_32">sensuality, will calm you down. You will become centered. </div>
<div id="tx_32" class="t s1_32">But I am for sensitivity. Even if it brings indulgence, even if it brings sensuality, </div>
<div id="ty_32" class="t s1_32">it's okay. I am not afraid of indulgence and sensuality. I am afraid of only one </div>
<div id="tz_32" class="t s1_32">thing: that the fear of indulgence and sensuality may kill your sensitivity. If it is </div>
<div id="t10_32" class="t s1_32">killed, you have committed suicide. Sensitive, you are alive, aware; the more </div>
<div id="t11_32" class="t s1_32">sensitive, the more alive and aware. And when your sensitivity becomes total, </div>
<div id="t12_32" class="t s1_32">you have entered the Divine. </div>
