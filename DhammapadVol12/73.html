<div id="t7_73" class="t s1_73">AND </div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s1_73">SORROW AND THE PLEASURES OF THE SENSES, HE HAS MOVED BEYOND </div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s1_73">TIME. HE IS PURE AND FREE. </div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s1_73">These four things have to be understood. The first is the senses and their pleasures; that </div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s1_73">is the lowest kind of life. And remember, by calling it the "lowest" Buddha is not </div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s1_73">judging it, it is not an evaluation -- it is simply stating a fact. Just as you say "the lowest </div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s1_73">rung of the ladder" -- there is no judgment. It is not bad, it is no more special than the </div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s1_73">highest rung. It is simply a statement of fact. This has to be continuously remembered, </div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s1_73">otherwise you will forget; you will start thinking that Buddha himself is judging. Then </div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s1_73">is he a master or not? He is not judging, he is simply stating a fact. </div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s1_73">Senses are the lowest because they are on the circumference, they are part of your body. </div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s1_73">There are people who live only in the senses, they are still living like animals. Again </div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s1_73">remember, it is not a judgment: animals are not bad, animals are not immoral. There is </div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s1_73">no question of hierarchy. But animals live in the body, and the man who lives only in </div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s1_73">his senses is living an animal kind of life. He is living in the porch of his palace. Not that </div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s1_73">he is immoral, but certainly he is unintelligent. He could have lived in the palace and he </div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s1_73">is living in the porch -- and suffering the heat of the sun, and in the rains he suffers the </div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s1_73">rains and in the cold he suffers from the cold. He could have been in the safety and the </div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s1_73">comforts and the coziness of the palace. The palace belongs to him, but he lives in the </div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s1_73">porch believing that that's all there is to life. </div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s1_73">The man who lives only in sensuality, lust, who is obsessed with food, who is obsessed </div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s1_73">with his body, continuously thinking of the body, is not yet a man. He is a good animal, </div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s1_73">but utterly blind to the potential that he is born to, utterly blind to what he can become, </div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s1_73">unconscious of the whole range of his being. </div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s1_73">The second circle, deeper than the body, is that of the mind. Mind has its own pleasures </div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s1_73">which are a little higher. Again, remember, it has nothing to do with judgment. They </div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s1_73">are a little deeper, they are a little closer to the innermost shrine. They actualize a little </div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s1_73">bit of your potential. The man who enjoys mathematics, science, philosophy certainly </div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s1_73">has a deeper sense of joy. Plato has a deeper sense of joy than Nero. </div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s1_73">It is said about Nero that he used to keep four physicians constantly with him even </div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s1_73">when he went to war. Those four physicians were to help him vomit because he liked to </div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s1_73">eat so many times in the day. Now you cannot eat so many times a day; there is a </div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s1_73">limitation. You can eat three times, four times, five times at the most; more than that </div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s1_73">will be impossible. The body will not contain it, you will burst. So after eating, the </div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s1_73">physicians would help him to vomit immediately so he could eat again. He used to eat </div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s1_73">at least twenty times per day. He must have been the greatest eater in the world. But </div>
<div id="t17_73" class="t s1_73">what kind of life is this? -- twenty times vomiting to eat twenty times! -- as if he lived </div>
<div id="t18_73" class="t s1_73">only in the buds of the tongue, in the taste buds. </div>
<div id="t19_73" class="t s1_73">Of course Plato is far deeper. He enjoys a contemplative life: he contemplates the stars, </div>
<div id="t1a_73" class="t s1_73">he contemplates the sunrise and the sunset, he contemplates the possibility of human </div>
<div id="t1b_73" class="t s1_73">progress. And he enjoys it -- and he enjoys it so much that many times he forgets to eat, </div>
<div id="t1c_73" class="t s1_73">he forgets completely that he has missed a meal. </div>
