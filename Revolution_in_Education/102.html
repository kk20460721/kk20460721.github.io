<div id="t1_102" class="t s1_102">CHAPTER 9. TRANSFORMATION THROUGH AWARENESS</div>
<div id="t2_102" class="t s2_102">The present education system cannot do anything, because the whole system of education today</div>
<div id="t3_102" class="t s2_102">is devised keeping goals in mind. We are teaching goals to children. We are teaching children not</div>
<div id="t4_102" class="t s2_102">to steal – non-stealing is the goal. That goal is somewhere in the future: today the children steal.</div>
<div id="t5_102" class="t s2_102">Today the teacher is stealing, the father is stealing, the mother is also stealing, the town is stealing,</div>
<div id="t6_102" class="t s2_102">the whole world is stealing. And everybody is teaching non-stealing, to give up stealing. The child</div>
<div id="t7_102" class="t s2_102">also takes a vow to give up stealing, but the moment this vow is being taken, at that very moment the</div>
<div id="t8_102" class="t s2_102">stealing is accepted; stealing will continue – because the child says, he will give up stealing. What</div>
<div id="t9_102" class="t s2_102">is promised for tomorrow becomes a lie; nothing is to be done today. Today stealing is to be done,</div>
<div id="ta_102" class="t s2_102">has to be done – but it will have to be given up, that is the goal of man. Talking about the goals in</div>
<div id="tb_102" class="t s2_102">the life of man is a highly dishonest thing.</div>
<div id="tc_102" class="t s2_102">Now we need a new system of education wherein a child is not just told not to tell any lies, but he</div>
<div id="td_102" class="t s2_102">should be told to just remain aware when he is telling a lie. There is no necessity to be afraid or to</div>
<div id="te_102" class="t s2_102">run away, but only to know that you are telling a lie. The fact that the child has become aware, due</div>
<div id="tf_102" class="t s2_102">to your assistance, of the act of lying, is enough. We do not have to tell them anything more. We</div>
<div id="tg_102" class="t s2_102">do not have to tell them not to tell a lie or to give up lying; that question does not arise. A child’s</div>
<div id="th_102" class="t s2_102">sensitivity should increase so much that it knows instantly that it has told a lie. It should not happen</div>
<div id="ti_102" class="t s2_102">that the child tells a lie but does not know that it has told a lie. But such things are happening in our</div>
<div id="tj_102" class="t s2_102">life! Man is not able to understand things.</div>
<div id="tk_102" class="t s2_102">You meet a man passing on the road and you just ask him, ”How are you?”... and then you inquire if</div>
<div id="tl_102" class="t s2_102">he had seen a particular person. He says he saw him only yesterday. That particular man was not</div>
<div id="tm_102" class="t s2_102">there in the town at all. That man who had replied had nothing to do with the person about whom</div>
<div id="tn_102" class="t s2_102">the inquiry was made. He was not aware that he was telling a lie. He had no interest in telling a</div>
<div id="to_102" class="t s2_102">lie. But he was perhaps not aware about what he was speaking or why he was speaking. But there</div>
<div id="tp_102" class="t s2_102">must be some reason why he was speaking. Neither was he aware of those reasons nor had he any</div>
<div id="tq_102" class="t s2_102">idea of them.</div>
<div id="tr_102" class="t s2_102">I had a professor. Whenever I talked about any book, he would immediately say, ”Oh! It is very good,</div>
<div id="ts_102" class="t s2_102">I have read about that book!” After a few days I began to doubt, because if he had read that book</div>
<div id="tt_102" class="t s2_102">he never mentioned it in the class. It seemed there was not a single book which he had not read.</div>
<div id="tu_102" class="t s2_102">One day when I met him, I gave him a false name of a nonexistent writer. I told him there was a</div>
<div id="tv_102" class="t s2_102">Russian philosopher named Bornokov</div>
<div id="tw_102" class="t s2_102">....</div>
<div id="tx_102" class="t s2_102">He said, ”Oh yes! His book is very good. I have read his</div>
<div id="ty_102" class="t s2_102">book – but I have read it about twenty years ago!”</div>
<div id="tz_102" class="t s2_102">I then immediately told him that there was no such author born twenty years ago or even twenty</div>
<div id="t10_102" class="t s2_102">crores of years ago. When there was no such author, there could be no question of his writing a</div>
<div id="t11_102" class="t s2_102">book. ”I asked the question only because I felt that you had not read a certain book, but you were</div>
<div id="t12_102" class="t s2_102">simply saying that you had read it. It was painful for you to accept that there could be any book</div>
<div id="t13_102" class="t s2_102">which you might not have read!”</div>
<div id="t14_102" class="t s2_102">Such is the ego, creating problems. But he was not aware. He was so much accustomed to speak</div>
<div id="t15_102" class="t s2_102">that way that it would be wrong to say that he was knowingly telling a lie.</div>
<div id="t16_102" class="t s2_102">This had become his</div>
<div id="t17_102" class="t s2_102">nature, a part of his blood – lies come out of it.</div>
<div id="t18_102" class="t s2_102">Therefore there is no question of teaching someone not to tell lies. The question is of awakening him</div>
<div id="t19_102" class="t s2_102">so that whenever he tells a lie he would know that he has told a lie. I believe that it is slowly becoming</div>
<div id="t1a_102" class="t s2_102">Revolution in Education</div>
<div id="t1b_102" class="t s2_102">102</div>
<div id="t1c_102" class="t s3_102">Osho</div>
