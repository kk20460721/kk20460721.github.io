<div id="t1_5" class="t s1_5">The psychiatrist asked, "What has happened to this man?" </div>
<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">The superintendent said, "This is the man who married that same woman! Since he has </div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">married her he wants to kill her, and if he cannot kill her then he wants to kill anybody </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">instead, but he wants to kill and destroy. He wants to kill the whole world! That woman </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">drove him mad." </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">One is mad because he could not get her, the other is mad because he COULD get her. </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">This is the whole history of every human being, more or less. It may not be so extreme, </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">so you don't see it, but the differences are only in degrees. The man in the grip of desire </div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">is bound to become insane. </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">And Buddha says: PLEASURE</div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">....</div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">Pleasure means that you think the body is the only </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">source of happiness. That is sheer stupidity. The body's pleasures are very momentary; </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">they are not real pleasures. But everybody is caught in the net of the body. We are born </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">as bodies, but we need not die as bodies. If we die as bodies, our whole life was a sheer </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">wastage. You have to grow up. </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">And remember: growing old is not growing up. Everybody grows old, but very few </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">people, very rare people grow up. One who really grows up becomes a buddha. </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">Growing up means you start becoming alert about bodily pleasures -- that they are </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">momentary and they can change into their opposite very easily. </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">For example, you love eating and you can go on eating too much. Then it becomes a </div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">pain. It was pleasure in the beginning, but there is a limit to that pleasure. It is said of </div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">Nero that he used to have four physicians always with him. Even when he was going </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">into war those four physicians used to accompany him. When Nero would eat, their </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">whole work was to help him to vomit so that he could eat again. He used to love eating </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">so much that he would eat twenty times, twenty-five times per day. You will call him </div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">mad -- and he was mad. </div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">Now, what is the pleasure of eating? Maybe just a little pleasure of taste</div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">....</div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">On your </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">tongue there are little buds which experience taste. They can be operated on very easily </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">and then you will not feel anything at all. Then the whole pleasure of eating disappears. </div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s1_5">That's what happens when you are in fever: your buds become dull, insensitive, so you </div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s1_5">eat but you don't feel any taste. People are living for eating; there are very few people </div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s1_5">who eat to live. Millions are living only to eat. </div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">Humanity can be divided into two types of mad people: one type is obsessed with food, </div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">another type is obsessed with sex. And there is a deep relation between the two. The </div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">person who is obsessed with sex will not bother much about food and the person who is </div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s1_5">repressive of sex will become obsessed with food. </div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s1_5">Whenever a country is repressive of sex it becomes very obsessed with food. That's </div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s1_5">what has happened in this country: for centuries it has been repressive of sex. That's </div>
<div id="t16_5" class="t s1_5">why Indians have been very inventive about food -- new sweets, thousands of sweets. </div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s1_5">The world is completely unaware of all those sweets! And their food is so spicy</div>
<div id="t18_5" class="t s1_5">....</div>
<div id="t19_5" class="t s1_5">When </div>
<div id="t1a_5" class="t s1_5">a foreigner comes he cannot eat it; he cannot see how people can eat it. It is burning hot! </div>
<div id="t1b_5" class="t s1_5">Why so much spicy food? It is repression of sex! If your sex is not repressed you will not </div>
<div id="t1c_5" class="t s1_5">eat such spicy food. </div>
