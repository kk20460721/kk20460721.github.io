<div id="t2_87" class="t s2_87">It is a very strange world! You don’t know people’s real lives; all that you know is their masks. You</div>
<div id="t3_87" class="t s2_87">see them in the churches, you see them in the clubs, in the hotels, in the dancing halls, and it seems</div>
<div id="t4_87" class="t s2_87">everybody is rejoicing, everybody is living a heavenly life, except you – of course, because you know</div>
<div id="t5_87" class="t s2_87">how miserable you are within. And the same is the case with everybody else! They are all wearing</div>
<div id="t6_87" class="t s2_87">masks, deceiving everybody, but how can you deceive yourself? You know that the mask is not your</div>
<div id="t7_87" class="t s2_87">original face.</div>
<div id="t8_87" class="t s2_87">But the parents go on pretending before their children, go on deceiving their own children. They are</div>
<div id="t9_87" class="t s2_87">not even authentic with their own children! They will not confess that their life has been a failure; on</div>
<div id="ta_87" class="t s2_87">the contrary, they will pretend that they have been very successful. And they would like the children</div>
<div id="tb_87" class="t s2_87">also to live in the same way as they have lived.</div>
<div id="tc_87" class="t s2_87">Prem Shunya, you ask: MY PARENTS ARE SO DISAPPOINTED IN ME...</div>
<div id="td_87" class="t s2_87">Don’t be worried at all – all parents are disappointed in their children! And I say all, without any</div>
<div id="te_87" class="t s2_87">exception. Even the parents of Gautam the Buddha were very much disappointed in him, the parents</div>
<div id="tf_87" class="t s2_87">of Jesus Christ were very much disappointed in him, obviously. They had lived a certain kind of life</div>
<div id="tg_87" class="t s2_87">– they were orthodox Jews – and this son, this Jesus, was going against many traditional ideas,</div>
<div id="th_87" class="t s2_87">conventions. Jesus’ father, Joseph, must have hoped that now he is growing old the son will help</div>
<div id="ti_87" class="t s2_87">him in his carpentry, in his work, in his shop – and the stupid son started talking about kingdom of</div>
<div id="tj_87" class="t s2_87">God! Do you think he was very much happy in his old age?</div>
<div id="tk_87" class="t s2_87">Gautam Buddha’s father was very old and he had only one son, and that too was born to him when</div>
<div id="tl_87" class="t s2_87">he was very old His whole life he has waited and prayed and worshipped and did all kinds of religious</div>
<div id="tm_87" class="t s2_87">rituals so that he can have a son, because who is going to look after his great kingdom? And then</div>
<div id="tn_87" class="t s2_87">one day the son disappeared from the palace. Do you think he was very happy? He was so angry,</div>
<div id="to_87" class="t s2_87">violently angry, he would have killed Gautam Buddha if he had found him! His police, his detectives</div>
<div id="tp_87" class="t s2_87">were searching all over the kingdom. ”Where he is hiding? Bring him to me!”</div>
<div id="tq_87" class="t s2_87">And Buddha knew it, that he will be caught by his father’s agents, so the ﬁrst thing he did was he left</div>
<div id="tr_87" class="t s2_87">the boundary of his father’s kingdom; escaped into another kingdom, and for twelve years nothing</div>
<div id="ts_87" class="t s2_87">was heard about him.</div>
<div id="tt_87" class="t s2_87">When he became enlightened he came back home to share his joy, to say to the father that, ”I have</div>
<div id="tu_87" class="t s2_87">arrived home,” that ”I have realized,” that ”I have known the truth – and this is the way.”</div>
<div id="tv_87" class="t s2_87">But the father was so angry, he was trembling and shaking – he was old, very old.</div>
<div id="tw_87" class="t s2_87">He shouted</div>
<div id="tx_87" class="t s2_87">at Buddha and he said, ”You are a disgrace to me!” He saw Buddha – he was standing there in a</div>
<div id="ty_87" class="t s2_87">beggar’s robe with a begging bowl – and he said, ”How you dare to stand before me like a beggar?</div>
<div id="tz_87" class="t s2_87">You are the son of an emperor, and in our family there has never been a beggar! My father was</div>
<div id="t10_87" class="t s2_87">an emperor, his father was too, and for centuries we have been emperors! You have disgraced the</div>
<div id="t11_87" class="t s2_87">whole heritage!”</div>
<div id="t12_87" class="t s2_87">Buddha listened for half an hour, he didn’t say a single word. When the father ran out of gas, cooled</div>
<div id="t13_87" class="t s2_87">down a little... tears were coming out of his eyes, tears of anger, frustration. Then Buddha said, ”I</div>
<div id="t14_87" class="t s2_87">ask for only one favor. Please wipe your tears and look at me – I am not the same person who had</div>
<div id="t15_87" class="t s2_87">left the home, I am totally transformed. But your eyes are so full of tears you cannot see. And you</div>
<div id="t16_87" class="t s2_87">are still talking to somebody who is no more! He has died.”</div>
<div id="t17_87" class="t s2_87">I Am That</div>
<div id="t18_87" class="t s2_87">87</div>
