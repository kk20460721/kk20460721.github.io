<div id="t1_83" class="t s1_83">What were they asking? They were asking, "Master, now that you are leaving, a few </div>
<div id="t2_83" class="t s1_83">things have to be made clear. In the world of God, in the kingdom of God, that you </div>
<div id="t3_83" class="t s1_83">have talked about so much again and again, you will certainly be on the right hand of </div>
<div id="t4_83" class="t s1_83">God; then who will be on your right hand? Amongst us who is going to be second to </div>
<div id="t5_83" class="t s1_83">you and who is going to be third and the fourth? What will the hierarchy be?" </div>
<div id="t6_83" class="t s1_83">See the question! The master is going to be crucified tomorrow, and these foolish people </div>
<div id="t7_83" class="t s1_83">are worried about hierarchy, who will be the highest. They are ready to concede to </div>
<div id="t8_83" class="t s1_83">Jesus, "Okay, that much we accept, that you will be second to God, but who will be </div>
<div id="t9_83" class="t s1_83">third and the fourth and the fifth? Let it be decided clearly, because now you are </div>
<div id="ta_83" class="t s1_83">leaving and we may not meet again soon, so everything has to be certain!" </div>
<div id="tb_83" class="t s1_83">The desirous mind, the ambitious mind -- they have not understood Jesus at all. And it </div>
<div id="tc_83" class="t s1_83">is said Jesus fell on his knees and prayed and tears rolled down his cheeks. Nobody </div>
<div id="td_83" class="t s1_83">knows what he prayed, but he must have been praying: "Forgive these people, they </div>
<div id="te_83" class="t s1_83">know not what they are asking." And he must have been crying because this was his </div>
<div id="tf_83" class="t s1_83">whole life's work, these people. And he has been telling them not to desire, not to be </div>
<div id="tg_83" class="t s1_83">ambitious. He has been telling them, "Those who are the first in this world will be the </div>
<div id="th_83" class="t s1_83">last in my kingdom of God, and those who are the last will be the first." But they have </div>
<div id="ti_83" class="t s1_83">not understood that he is telling them not to be ambitious. </div>
<div id="tj_83" class="t s1_83">Just the other day, Premgeet sent me a small anecdote on misinterpretation: </div>
<div id="tk_83" class="t s1_83">The frantic nurse ran after a screaming patient down the corridor of the ward, carrying </div>
<div id="tl_83" class="t s1_83">a bowl. She was stopped by the surgeon who said, "Nurse! Nurse! I told you to prick his </div>
<div id="tm_83" class="t s1_83">boil!" </div>
<div id="tn_83" class="t s1_83">You get it? She was boiling his prick! But this is exactly what goes on happening -- the </div>
<div id="to_83" class="t s1_83">mob mind cannot understand. Misunderstanding is inevitable, because the mass mind </div>
<div id="tp_83" class="t s1_83">is deaf. While you are talking to people they are not really listening, they are only </div>
<div id="tq_83" class="t s1_83">pretending to listen. A thousand and one thoughts are crossing through their minds; </div>
<div id="tr_83" class="t s1_83">they are not really there, they are never present to any situation, they are always absent. </div>
<div id="ts_83" class="t s1_83">They are not where they are, they are always somewhere else. When they are in Poona, </div>
<div id="tt_83" class="t s1_83">they are in Beijing; when they are in Beijing, they are in Poona. Strange people! </div>
<div id="tu_83" class="t s1_83">Wherever they are you can be certain that there at least they are not; anywhere else in </div>
<div id="tv_83" class="t s1_83">the world they can be. How can they understand? </div>
<div id="tw_83" class="t s1_83">And they listen only to words, they never listen to the meaning -- because the meaning </div>
<div id="tx_83" class="t s1_83">can be listened to only by the heart. The words can be listened to by the head. Now, </div>
<div id="ty_83" class="t s1_83">they don't know how to listen through the heart. Listening through the heart is the </div>
<div id="tz_83" class="t s1_83">meaning of being a disciple; listening through the heart means listening in love, in trust, </div>
<div id="t10_83" class="t s1_83">in deep sympathy, and finally in deep empathy. Listening through the heart means </div>
<div id="t11_83" class="t s1_83">listening as if you have become one with what is being told to you -- when the disciple </div>
<div id="t12_83" class="t s1_83">becomes so attuned to the master that even before the words are uttered he hears them, </div>
<div id="t13_83" class="t s1_83">and not only the words but the meaning, the fragrance that is carried by the words. But </div>
<div id="t14_83" class="t s1_83">it is very invisible. The head is gross. </div>
<div id="t15_83" class="t s1_83">The invisible can be caught only in the net of the heart. </div>
