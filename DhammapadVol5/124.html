<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">awakening of your soul, it is awareness. What is meant by being a witness is that you </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">don't condemn, you don't appreciate either. You don't evaluate at all -- you don't say </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">anything, you simply see. </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">A thought passes inside your mind; you simply see it, mirrorlike. You don't say good, </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">bad; you don't label it. You simply see it is coming in, it is in front of you, it is going out. </div>

<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">witness he will be the same as the Hindu when he becomes a witness. </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">That's why Buddha and Jesus and Moses and Mohammed are not different; they are </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">witnesses. But the Mohammedan, the Christian, the Buddhist, the Jew, they are </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">different. They live through the ideology given by the society, and the society has its </div>

<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">in your ideologies; they will dominate you. This is a social strategy to dominate you. </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">Not only have they placed the policeman outside, and the magistrate and the </div>

<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">they have created only bondage for you. They have created chains for you, subtle prison </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">cells for you. The conscience is the most subtle slavery. </div>
