<div id="t1_230" class="t s1_230">CHAPTER 20. YOU CANNOT MANUFACTURE ENLIGHTENMENT</div>
<div id="t2_230" class="t s2_230">council, which was in London. That was very cunning. That was the last resort, above the supreme</div>
<div id="t3_230" class="t s2_230">court of India.</div>
<div id="t4_230" class="t s2_230">The privy council was in England; she took the case there, and because the case was now to be</div>
<div id="t5_230" class="t s2_230">fought in England, she took Krishnamurti away to England.</div>
<div id="t6_230" class="t s2_230">Once he was outside India then no</div>
<div id="t7_230" class="t s2_230">Indian law was applicable. He still carries a British passport, the same that was given to him by</div>
<div id="t8_230" class="t s2_230">Annie Besant.</div>
<div id="t9_230" class="t s2_230">He is a British citizen because Annie Besant made him a British citizen, so that</div>
<div id="ta_230" class="t s2_230">nothing from India can bother him in any way.</div>
<div id="tb_230" class="t s2_230">Krishnamurti was going to be declared the world teacher. Great preparations were made. In 1925,</div>
<div id="tc_230" class="t s2_230">in Holland, a world conference was called of all the theosophists. Six thousand representatives from</div>
<div id="td_230" class="t s2_230">every country of the world gathered there for this great event. Krishnamurti was going to declare</div>
<div id="te_230" class="t s2_230">himself the world teacher, and immediately there was going to be a tremendous transformation in</div>
<div id="tf_230" class="t s2_230">the world.</div>
<div id="tg_230" class="t s2_230">But Krishnamurti was also tired of these theosophists. They had been as nasty to him as anyone</div>
<div id="th_230" class="t s2_230">can be. And it was not his desire – it was imposed upon him forcibly. Books were written in his name</div>
<div id="ti_230" class="t s2_230">by others and he had to sign them; he was going to be the world teacher, so he had to show some</div>
<div id="tj_230" class="t s2_230">wisdom before he declared it. So there is a book, At the Feet of the Master; Krishnamurti does not</div>
<div id="tk_230" class="t s2_230">remember at all that he ever wrote that book – and that is one of the best books theosophy has</div>
<div id="tl_230" class="t s2_230">produced. It is rare, a masterpiece; it must have been the work of Leadbeater, because he was a</div>
<div id="tm_230" class="t s2_230">master writer, a master orator; or perhaps many people may have joined together.</div>
<div id="tn_230" class="t s2_230">The book is of immense value in itself; who wrote it does not matter. But Krishnamurti does not</div>
<div id="to_230" class="t s2_230">even remember. He says that three hours of sleep and the whole day he was feeling sleepy... and</div>
<div id="tp_230" class="t s2_230">they were chanting mantras and they were reading Tibetan scriptures and Chinese scriptures, and</div>
<div id="tq_230" class="t s2_230">telling him the meaning, and he was not there at all – he was almost in the state of a zombie. And</div>
<div id="tr_230" class="t s2_230">they were taking signatures from him for all kinds of things.</div>
<div id="ts_230" class="t s2_230">He took good revenge. At the ﬁrst day of the meeting he stood up and declared, ”I am not the world</div>
<div id="tt_230" class="t s2_230">teacher at all, and I dissolve the organization that has been created for me.” A special organization,</div>
<div id="tu_230" class="t s2_230">Star of the East – a wing of the theosophical movement – was created especially for the world</div>
<div id="tv_230" class="t s2_230">teacher.</div>
<div id="tw_230" class="t s2_230">It was to have ofﬁces all over the world, secretaries, funds, lands – everything that</div>
<div id="tx_230" class="t s2_230">Krishnamurti as a world teacher needs. He was donated castles, palaces – and this whole wing</div>
<div id="ty_230" class="t s2_230">of thousands of people he dissolved. He returned all the castles and all the palaces to their owners</div>
<div id="tz_230" class="t s2_230">and he said, ”I am ﬁnished with it.” Leadbeater had failed again.</div>
<div id="t10_230" class="t s2_230">And why did Krishnamurti become so adamant against the idea of world teacher?</div>
<div id="t11_230" class="t s2_230">These</div>
<div id="t12_230" class="t s2_230">theosophists made him. It was a constant torture. This was for the ﬁrst time he was free to speak</div>
<div id="t13_230" class="t s2_230">before the world audience; now they could not do anything else. Annie Besant started crying and</div>
<div id="t14_230" class="t s2_230">weeping. But what can you do? And he was saying, ”Yes, yes” up to the last moment, and at the last</div>
<div id="t15_230" class="t s2_230">moment he just turned around one hundred and eighty degrees and said, ”I am nobody’s teacher.”</div>
<div id="t16_230" class="t s2_230">The theosophists must really have tortured him – for his own sake. He still carries the scars, they are</div>
<div id="t17_230" class="t s2_230">not healed. Krishnamurti is not healed yet. He is still angry at all those people who died long ago;</div>
<div id="t18_230" class="t s2_230">not one of them is alive. But he carries those years with them. From the ninth year to his twenty-ﬁfth</div>
<div id="t19_230" class="t s2_230">year were too much because they were trying to compress the whole wisdom of the world in him.</div>
<div id="t1a_230" class="t s2_230">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t1b_230" class="t s2_230">230</div>
<div id="t1c_230" class="t s3_230">Osho</div>
