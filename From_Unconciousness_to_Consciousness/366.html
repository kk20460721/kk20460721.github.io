<div id="t1_366" class="t s1_366">CHAPTER 30. THE ONLY GOLDEN RULE IS THERE ARE NO GOLDEN RULES</div>
<div id="t2_366" class="t s2_366">My grandfather was telling him, ”Now you are a graduate.</div>
<div id="t3_366" class="t s2_366">Be ﬁnished; start looking after the</div>
<div id="t4_366" class="t s2_366">business.”</div>
<div id="t5_366" class="t s2_366">I told him, ”Don’t listen to him. He will kill your whole future.”</div>
<div id="t6_366" class="t s2_366">He said, ”You are a strange boy. You are suggesting to me that I should not listen to my own father</div>
<div id="t7_366" class="t s2_366">and I should listen to you.”</div>
<div id="t8_366" class="t s2_366">I said, ”One day you will repent. So listen to him.” He listened to him. And just before we left Poona</div>
<div id="t9_366" class="t s2_366">he came to see me, and he told me, ”Forgive me.</div>
<div id="ta_366" class="t s2_366">I can still remember you, so small, trying to</div>
<div id="tb_366" class="t s2_366">persuade me not to listen to my father. And of course that was the most convenient thing for me.</div>
<div id="tc_366" class="t s2_366">The business was there; I was getting my inheritance. The business was settled, I was not to do</div>
<div id="td_366" class="t s2_366">much.”</div>
<div id="te_366" class="t s2_366">And once he went into the business, my grandfather immediately started looking for a girl for him. I</div>
<div id="tf_366" class="t s2_366">said to him, ”Look. You are getting caught by and by.”</div>
<div id="tg_366" class="t s2_366">He said to me, ”Are you my friend or my enemy? My father is looking for a wife, and you are telling</div>
<div id="th_366" class="t s2_366">me that he is looking for a prison for me.”</div>
<div id="ti_366" class="t s2_366">I said, ”It is up to you to decide. You should look for your wife. Why should your father look? Strange,</div>
<div id="tj_366" class="t s2_366">his father looked for him – he missed. Now he is looking for you – you will miss. How can he ﬁnd a</div>
<div id="tk_366" class="t s2_366">wife for you?” But my grandfather was a strong man. It was not possible for my uncle to say anything</div>
<div id="tl_366" class="t s2_366">to him; if he decided, it was ﬁnal. And one day he decided for his marriage. The marriage happened.</div>
<div id="tm_366" class="t s2_366">I went to his marriage, and I teased him all the way: ”You are going to a life imprisonment.”</div>
<div id="tn_366" class="t s2_366">When he came to Poona, he said to me, ”You were right. It was a life imprisonment, and it went</div>
<div id="to_366" class="t s2_366">on growing bigger and bigger – ﬁrst business, then wife, then children, now children’s education,</div>
<div id="tp_366" class="t s2_366">now children’s marriage.” And now he is sixty-ﬁve, and he has no time for poetry. When he was in</div>
<div id="tq_366" class="t s2_366">Poona, just for two, three weeks, he started writing poetry again. And he told me, ”For years I have</div>
<div id="tr_366" class="t s2_366">completely forgotten; there has been no time. But looking at you, remembering what you had said</div>
<div id="ts_366" class="t s2_366">to me, I realized you were right. I would like to come here for a few months and to bring back my</div>
<div id="tt_366" class="t s2_366">dreams and my visions, which have all disappeared.”</div>
<div id="tu_366" class="t s2_366">Just two, three days ago, Sheela brought his letter: ”Now you have gone too far away and it will not</div>
<div id="tv_366" class="t s2_366">be possible for me to come there, and I was hoping to come to Poona.” For what was he hoping to</div>
<div id="tw_366" class="t s2_366">come to Poona? And do you think now – since I had advised him, so much water has passed down</div>
<div id="tx_366" class="t s2_366">the Ganges – he will be able to revive his poetry? I don’t think so, because he had shown me a</div>
<div id="ty_366" class="t s2_366">few things that he wrote while he was in Poona – they were not of the quality that I remember was</div>
<div id="tz_366" class="t s2_366">there when he was young. Now so much junk has collected. He is no longer young: tired, bored,</div>
<div id="t10_366" class="t s2_366">repenting continuously. The few days he was there, every day he was repenting, ”Alas, I did not</div>
<div id="t11_366" class="t s2_366">listen to you.” But nobody would have listened to a child. And what I was suggesting was rebellion</div>
<div id="t12_366" class="t s2_366">against the father, his father.</div>
<div id="t13_366" class="t s2_366">A profession you can choose, which is convenient; friends you can choose, who are convenient. I</div>
<div id="t14_366" class="t s2_366">have seen strange people. I had one friend – I rarely had friends, and those I had were not much of</div>
<div id="t15_366" class="t s2_366">friends. So I don’t remember really having any friend; it is just a word. But he thought that he was a</div>
<div id="t16_366" class="t s2_366">friend to me – he was a professor in the chemistry department.</div>
<div id="t17_366" class="t s2_366">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t18_366" class="t s2_366">366</div>
<div id="t19_366" class="t s3_366">Osho</div>
