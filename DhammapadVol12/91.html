<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">has to be created, man is born empty. And millions die only as hollow emptinesses. </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">Their souls are never born because they never make any effort. The old idea is that </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">everybody is born with a soul; it frees you from the great responsibility of creating your </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">own being, of creating yourself. When there is no responsibility to create, you go on </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">living accidentally, like driftwood. </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">Buddha says freedom is the very law of life. What he means by it is that there is nothing </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">higher than freedom. But by the word 'law', please don't misunderstand him. In fact for </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">dhamma, the word 'law' is only approximately right. In the English language there is </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">not exactly the right word for dhamma. In Chinese there is a word tao that exactly </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">means dhamma. The closest word in English is logos, but that has gone out of use. </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">Hence 'the law' is used, but 'law' has other associations: the ordinary law of the state, of </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">governments, of societies. That is not the meaning of Buddha. Of course, these laws are </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">inhibitions; they prohibit you, they hinder you from freedom. </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">Buddha is saying freedom is the only real law and anything that hinders your freedom </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">is against the law of life. Be free. All those laws have to be broken, sabotaged. You have </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">to take your life in your own hands and you are responsible for it. No fate is </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">responsible, no destiny is responsible. You have to create yourself by your own effort. </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">You are just a tabula rasa. You can write beautiful poems on it, beautiful calligraphy, </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">you can do beautiful paintings on it; or you can leave it as it is. Or you can simply </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">throw colors on it, meaninglessly, in an insane way, like a small child. You can destroy </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">the whole thing. And there is nobody else who is responsible except you; the total </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">responsibility is yours. </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">That is the most emphatic thing that Buddha wants you to remember: don't shirk your </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">responsibility. Whatsoever you are is your own work and whatsoever you want to be </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">you can be. But you can be that only if freedom is the law of life. If everything is </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">destined, if there is something like fate, if there is something which has been </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">preprogramed in you, then you are not a man at all, then you are just a biocomputer. </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">You are simply going to repeat the program, you are a gramophone record. You don't </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">have any freedom, you can't change anything. You are just play-things in the hands of </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">unknown forces. </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">Buddha says this is not true. Hence he even denies the existence of God for the simple </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">reason that if God is there then there will be trouble; then he will be the suprememost </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">being. His very presence will become an inhibition to you. </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">That's exactly the logic of Friedrich Nietzsche. He said: God is dead, therefore man is </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">now free. But Nietzsche was only a philosopher. He could not contain that much </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">freedom. He went mad. </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">Buddha is not a philosopher at all, he is a mystic. He used the freedom. He really </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">became responsible for himself. He created his own being and he became the most </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">beautiful person who has ever lived on the earth. He followed the law of freedom and </div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s1_91">achieved the ultimate joy, the ultimate truth. </div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">You can do the same too. That is his message. He says, "Whatsoever has happened to </div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s1_91">me can happen to you. If it is not happening, nobody else is responsible except you." So </div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s1_91">take the total responsibility in your own hands, feel and be responsible, and use the law </div>
