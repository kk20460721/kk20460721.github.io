<div id="t2_132" class="t s1_132">So St. Peter agreed to issue him with a special pass allowing him to stay for just twenty </div>
<div id="t3_132" class="t s1_132">hours. </div>
<div id="t4_132" class="t s1_132">Off went the gambler to have a look round hell, and the first thing he saw when he </div>
<div id="t5_132" class="t s1_132">arrived was a group of old acquaintances playing poker. However, they refused to admit </div>
<div id="t6_132" class="t s1_132">him into the game because he had no money. </div>
<div id="t7_132" class="t s1_132">"I will soon fix that," he said, and off he went down one of the corridors. Ten minutes </div>
<div id="t8_132" class="t s1_132">later he was back, flourishing a big roll of ten-pound notes. </div>
<div id="t9_132" class="t s1_132">"Where did you get all that money ?" asked one of the others. </div>
<div id="ta_132" class="t s1_132">"I sold my pass," replied the gambler. </div>
<div id="tb_132" class="t s1_132">Habits can be too much; you can even refuse heaven. In a fit of habit you are almost </div>
<div id="tc_132" class="t s1_132">unconscious and helpless. That's why the insistence of yoga is to bring more awareness to </div>
<div id="td_132" class="t s1_132">your ties. Remember as much as you can that you are not the body. And remember one </div>
<div id="te_132" class="t s1_132">thing more, that it is difficult to break a habit, but not difficult if you create another to </div>
<div id="tf_132" class="t s1_132">substitute it. And that's how it happens; people go on substituting habits. If you tell them, </div>
<div id="tg_132" class="t s1_132">"You are not the body," they will start thinking they are the mind. Then nothing changes, </div>
<div id="th_132" class="t s1_132">just the name of the habit changes. </div>
<div id="ti_132" class="t s1_132">This I see. If I tell somebody, "Stop smoking," he starts chewing pan. If I tell him to stop </div>
<div id="tj_132" class="t s1_132">chewing pan, he starts chewing gum. Or if you stop him from that too, he starts talking </div>
<div id="tk_132" class="t s1_132">too much; that too is the same thing. In the beginning he was just smoking; at least he </div>
<div id="tl_132" class="t s1_132">was harming only himself, nobody else. Now he cannot smoke, so he talks too much; </div>
<div id="tm_132" class="t s1_132">now he is destroying others' peace and silence also. A smoker is good in a way; he </div>
<div id="tn_132" class="t s1_132">remains confined to himself. Women talk too much; once they start smoking, their </div>
<div id="to_132" class="t s1_132">talking becomes less. </div>
<div id="tp_132" class="t s1_132">In fact you must have observed: whenever you feel nervous, you start smoking. That </div>
<div id="tq_132" class="t s1_132">smoking is just to escape from nervousness. And the same happens whenever you start </div>
<div id="tr_132" class="t s1_132">talking. You are feeling nervous; you want to distract yourself with something. </div>
<div id="ts_132" class="t s1_132">I have heard a beautiful anecdote. </div>
<div id="tt_132" class="t s1_132">The patient, who was only eighteen, caused a lot of worry to his parents because he </div>
<div id="tu_132" class="t s1_132">would spend hours in his room dressing himself very meticulously in his smart clothes. </div>
<div id="tv_132" class="t s1_132">He would take ages brushing his hair, polishing his shoes, then he would go into the </div>
<div id="tw_132" class="t s1_132">kitchen, stick a carrot in his left ear and go dancing at a disco. Naturally his parents were </div>
<div id="tx_132" class="t s1_132">worried about all this and they persuaded him to see a psychiatrist. He arrived at the </div>
<div id="ty_132" class="t s1_132">psychiatrist's office, beautifully groomed and wearing a stick of celery in his left ear. The </div>
<div id="tz_132" class="t s1_132">doctor gently mentioned that his parents were a little worried about him and then he </div>
<div id="t10_132" class="t s1_132">asked, "By the way, is there any reason for you to have a stick of celery protruding from </div>
<div id="t11_132" class="t s1_132">your left ear?" </div>
<div id="t12_132" class="t s1_132">The boy looked surprised and said, "Of course there is. Mum did not have any carrots." </div>
<div id="t13_132" class="t s1_132">Now if a carrot is dropped, then celery</div>
<div id="t14_132" class="t s1_132">....</div>
<div id="t15_132" class="t s1_132">But people go on changing habits. </div>
<div id="t16_132" class="t s1_132">Sometimes it happens you can change a bad habit into a good habit, and everybody will </div>
<div id="t17_132" class="t s1_132">be happy and everybody will be satisfied. But yoga will not be satisfied. You can stop </div>
<div id="t18_132" class="t s1_132">smoking and you can start repeating a mantra. Now if you don't repeat your mantra one </div>
<div id="t19_132" class="t s1_132">day, you feel uneasiness in the same way as you used to feel when you were smoking and </div>
