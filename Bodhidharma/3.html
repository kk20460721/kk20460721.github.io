<div id="t1_3" class="t s1_3">I have a very soft corner in my heart for Bodhidharma. That makes it a very </div>
<div id="t2_3" class="t s1_3">special occasion to speak about him. Perhaps he is the only man whom I have </div>
<div id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">loved so deeply that speaking on him I will be almost speaking on myself. That </div>
<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">also creates a great complexity, because he never wrote anything in his life. No </div>
<div id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">enlightened being has ever written. Bodhidharma is not an exception, but by </div>
<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">tradition these three books that we are going to discuss are attributed to </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">Bodhidharma. </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">The scholars reason that because there is no contrary evidence -- and for almost </div>
<div id="t9_3" class="t s1_3">one thousand years, these books have been attributed to Bodhidharma -- there is </div>
<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">no reason why we should not accept them. I am not a scholar, and there are </div>
<div id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">certainly fragments which must have been spoken by Bodhidharma, but these </div>
<div id="tc_3" class="t s1_3">are not books written by him. These are notes by his disciples. It was an ancient </div>
<div id="td_3" class="t s1_3">tradition that when a disciple takes notes from the master he does not put his </div>
<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">own name on those notes, because nothing of it belongs to him; it has come from </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">the master. </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">But knowing Bodhidharma as intimately as I know him ... There are so many </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">fallacies which are possible only if somebody else was taking notes and his own </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">mind entered into it; he has interpreted Bodhidharma -- and with not much </div>
<div id="tj_3" class="t s1_3">understanding. </div>
<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">Before we enter into these sutras, a few things about Bodhidharma will be good </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">to know. That will give you the flavor of the man and a way to understand what </div>
<div id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">belongs to him in these books and what does not belong to him. It is going to be a </div>
<div id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">very strange commentary. </div>
<div id="to_3" class="t s1_3">Bodhidharma was born fourteen centuries ago as a son of a king in the south of </div>
<div id="tp_3" class="t s1_3">India. There was a big empire, the empire of Pallavas. He was the third son of his </div>
<div id="tq_3" class="t s1_3">father, but seeing everything -- he was a man of tremendous intelligence -- he </div>
<div id="tr_3" class="t s1_3">renounced the kingdom. He was not against the world, but he was not ready to </div>
<div id="ts_3" class="t s1_3">waste his time in mundane affairs, in trivia. His whole concern was to know his </div>
<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">self-nature, because without knowing it you have to accept death as the end. </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">All true seekers in fact, have been fighting against death. Bertrand Russell has </div>
<div id="tv_3" class="t s1_3">made a statement that if there were no death, there would be no religion. There is </div>
<div id="tw_3" class="t s1_3">some truth in it. I will not agree totally, because religion is a vast continent. It is </div>
<div id="tx_3" class="t s1_3">not only death, it is also the search for bliss, it is also the search for truth, it is also </div>
<div id="ty_3" class="t s1_3">the search for the meaning of life; it is many more things. But certainly Bertrand </div>
<div id="tz_3" class="t s1_3">Russell is right: if there were no death, very few, very rare people would be </div>
<div id="t10_3" class="t s1_3">interested in religion. Death is the great incentive. </div>
<div id="t11_3" class="t s1_3">Bodhidharma renounced the kingdom saying to his father, "If you cannot save </div>
<div id="t12_3" class="t s1_3">me from death, then please don't prevent me. Let me go in search of something </div>
<div id="t13_3" class="t s1_3">that is beyond death." Those were beautiful days, particularly in the East. The </div>
<div id="t14_3" class="t s1_3">father thought for a moment and he said, "I will not prevent you, because I </div>
<div id="t15_3" class="t s1_3">cannot prevent your death. You go on your search with all my blessings. It is sad </div>
<div id="t16_3" class="t s1_3">for me but that is my problem; it is my attachment. I was hoping for you to be the </div>
