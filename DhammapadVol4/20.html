<div id="t1_20" class="t s1_20">But students won't be able to see it. Disciples will be able to decipher a little bit, and </div>
<div id="t2_20" class="t s1_20">devotees will be able to drink out of it. </div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">Intellectual activity can make you experts in certain things, useful, efficient. But intellect </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">is a groping in the dark; it has no eyes, because it is not yet meditative. Intellect is </div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s1_20">borrowed, it has no insight of its own. </div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s1_20">The subject was lovemaking. For weeks Arthur had successfully answered all the </div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s1_20">questions asked him on the television quiz show. He was now eligible for the jackpot </div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">prize of one hundred thousand dollars. For this one question he was allowed to call an </div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">expert. Arthur of course chose a world-famous professor of sexology from France. </div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">The jackpot question was, "If you had been king during the first fifty years of the </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">Assyrian empire, which three parts of your bride's anatomy would you have been </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">expected to kiss on your wedding night?" </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">The first two answers came quickly. Arthur replied, "Her lips and her neck." </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">Now, stumped for the answer to the third part of the question, Arthur turned frantically </div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s1_20">to his expert. The Frenchman threw up his hands and groaned, "Alors, mon ami, do not </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s1_20">ask me. I have been wrong twice already." </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">The expert, the knowledgeable, the intellectual, has no insight of his own. He depends </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">on borrowed knowledge, on tradition, on convention. He carries libraries in his head, a </div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">great burden, but he has no vision. He knows much without knowing anything at all. </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">And because life is not the same ever -- it is constantly changing, moment to moment it </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s1_20">is new -- the expert always lags behind, his response is always inadequate. He can only </div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s1_20">react, he cannot respond, because he is not spontaneous. He has already arrived to </div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s1_20">conclusions; he is carrying ready-made answers -- and the questions that life raises are </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s1_20">always new. </div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s1_20">Moreover, life is not a logical phenomenon. And the intellectual lives through logic; </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s1_20">hence he never fits with life and life never fits with him. Of course life is not at a loss; </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s1_20">the intellectual himself is at a loss. He is always feeling like an outsider -- not that life </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">has expelled him; he himself has decided to remain outside life. If you cling too much to </div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s1_20">logic you will never be able to be part of the living process that this existence is. </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s1_20">Life is more than logic: life is paradox, life is mystery. </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">Gannaway and O'Casey arranged to fight a duel with pistols. Gannaway was quite fat, </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">and when he saw his lean adversary facing him he objected. "Debar!" he said, "I am </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s1_20">twice as large as he is, so I ought to stand twice as far away from him as he is from me." </div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s1_20">Absolutely logical, but how can you do it? </div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s1_20">"Be aisy now," replied his second. "I will soon put that right." And taking a piece of </div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s1_20">chalk from his pocket he drew two lines down the fat man's coat leaving a space </div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s1_20">between them. </div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s1_20">"Now," he said, turning to O'Casey, "fire away, and remember that any hits outside that </div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s1_20">chalk line don't count." </div>
