<div id="t2_55" class="t s1_55">you succeed. But whether you fail or you succeed, you are fulfilled all the same. </div>
<div id="t3_55" class="t s1_55">A deep contentment arises because you have done whatsoever you could do. </div>
<div id="t4_55" class="t s1_55">You can never be perfect. How can the part be perfect? You can never be perfect. </div>
<div id="t5_55" class="t s1_55">Whatsoever you do, you can always imagine that it could have been better -- </div>
<div id="t6_55" class="t s1_55">whatsoever you do, you can imagine that better could have been done. </div>
<div id="t7_55" class="t s1_55">I have heard about a great painter. He was seventy years old, and one day he </div>
<div id="t8_55" class="t s1_55">finished his painting and started crying and weeping. His disciples surrounded </div>
<div id="t9_55" class="t s1_55">the master and said, "Master, why are you crying? What has happened?" </div>
<div id="ta_55" class="t s1_55">The master said, "I cannot see any imperfection in this painting. It seems I am </div>
<div id="tb_55" class="t s1_55">dead, finished. It seems I have lost my imagination; that's why I'm crying. This is </div>
<div id="tc_55" class="t s1_55">the first time I cannot see any defect in my painting. I must have lost my </div>
<div id="td_55" class="t s1_55">imagination." </div>
<div id="te_55" class="t s1_55">Whatsoever you do, you can always imagine better. So a perfectionist is always </div>
<div id="tf_55" class="t s1_55">in misery. He can never be satisfied, never; that is not for him. </div>
<div id="tg_55" class="t s1_55">I want you to be whole. Whatsoever you do, you do totally and you are not </div>
<div id="th_55" class="t s1_55">concerned with the result. You are only concerned that you are not withholding </div>

<div id="tj_55" class="t s1_55">dance; you dance totally. You just become the dance and forget the dancer </div>
<div id="tk_55" class="t s1_55">completely. Whether the dance was perfect or not is not the question at all. And </div>
<div id="tl_55" class="t s1_55">who is to decide? Only one thing you have to decide -- whether you were totally </div>

<div id="tn_55" class="t s1_55">it, I say it is imperfect. That is my meaning of perfection. </div>
<div id="to_55" class="t s1_55">It is not comparative. If you dance, you may not dance like Udaya Shanker. </div>
<div id="tp_55" class="t s1_55">Comparatively your dance may be poorer than Udaya Shanker's. But there is a </div>
<div id="tq_55" class="t s1_55">possibility you may be more total in it than Udaya Shanker himself in his dance. </div>
<div id="tr_55" class="t s1_55">Then I say you are more perfect: because it is not a question of form; it is a </div>
<div id="ts_55" class="t s1_55">question of your inner involvement. If the ego drops, then it is whole, then it is </div>

<div id="tx_55" class="t s1_55">purchase anything. But he wasn't happy because there was always something </div>
<div id="ty_55" class="t s1_55">else to be purchased, something else to be brought to his treasury. He travelled </div>
<div id="tz_55" class="t s1_55">all over the world, but whenever he would come back to Athens he was more </div>
<div id="t10_55" class="t s1_55">miserable than before. </div>
<div id="t11_55" class="t s1_55">He came to see Socrates and he asked Socrates, "Why am I so miserable? -- and I </div>
<div id="t12_55" class="t s1_55">have travelled all over the world. I am the most travelled man in Athens, and one </div>
<div id="t13_55" class="t s1_55">would think that travelling gives experience and maturity. But nothing like that </div>
<div id="t14_55" class="t s1_55">has happened to me. I have become more and more miserable. And I go to the </div>
<div id="t15_55" class="t s1_55">far-off countries and then come back, from India, from China, but I'm not gaining </div>
<div id="t16_55" class="t s1_55">any experience. I am becoming more and more imperfect day by day, rather than </div>
<div id="t17_55" class="t s1_55">becoming perfect. What is the trouble with me?" </div>
