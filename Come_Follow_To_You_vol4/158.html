<div id="tc_158" class="t s1_158">and then you tell a bigger one, and then finally you over-reach yourselves.' </div>
<div id="td_158" class="t s1_158">That's the feeling with a man like Jesus. Ordinary humanity feels that way: that </div>

<div id="tg_158" class="t s1_158">certain convincing force in him. He is a man worth loving, but he is over-</div>
<div id="th_158" class="t s1_158">reaching himself. Whatever he is saying is beyond the ordinary human mind. In </div>
<div id="ti_158" class="t s1_158">fact, it is beyond the human mind. He is bringing something into the world of the </div>
<div id="tj_158" class="t s1_158">mind from the world of no-mind. This is an almost unbridgeable gap. He is </div>
<div id="tk_158" class="t s1_158">bound to be misunderstood. </div>
<div id="tl_158" class="t s1_158">In misunderstanding he was crucified. And when on the cross he said,'Father, </div>

<div id="tn_158" class="t s1_158">compassion, it was not just love. It was compassion, it was love; it was also fact. </div>

<div id="ts_158" class="t s1_158">their silent, peaceful lives, who had been forcing them against their wills on an </div>

<div id="tv_158" class="t s1_158">formality. </div>
<div id="tw_158" class="t s1_158">Jesus was trying to prove that God exists, not as a social formality, not as a prop </div>
<div id="tx_158" class="t s1_158">for morality, not as a hypothesis to explain the unexplainable. God exists. In fact, </div>

<div id="tz_158" class="t s1_158">talking about the ultimate fact, a suspicion arises in the ordinary mind:'They are </div>
<div id="t10_158" class="t s1_158">over-reaching themselves. It's okay to believe in God, and to believe in the </div>
<div id="t11_158" class="t s1_158">church and in the temple. It is good to pretend to be religious. It helps -- it is a </div>
<div id="t12_158" class="t s1_158">social lubricant. It gives life a certain smoothness; it gives you a certain </div>
<div id="t13_158" class="t s1_158">respectability. But one should not take these things too seriously. This man Jesus </div>
<div id="t14_158" class="t s1_158">seems to be too serious about it, as if it is a life-and-death problem.' </div>
<div id="t15_158" class="t s1_158">To him, it is the only problem worth encountering, and the only adventure worth </div>
<div id="t16_158" class="t s1_158">going on, the only research. But to the people he was talking to, it looked like </div>
<div id="t17_158" class="t s1_158">nonsense. They may not have said so; they may not have said so out of propriety. </div>
