<div id="t1_21" class="t s1_21">CHAPTER 2. THE OTHER CHEEK: THE MASOCHIST’S SLAP-UP FEAST</div>
<div id="t2_21" class="t s2_21">Whether I keep you starving or I keep myself starving, it is the same; the same principle and the</div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s2_21">same standard should be applied: I am a violent man, if not to your body, then to my own body.</div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s2_21">And in being violent with you, there was a possibility that you may have retaliated – you may have</div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s2_21">stopped me being violent to you. But to be violent with your own body is the easiest thing in the</div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s2_21">world. What can your body do? It cannot retaliate, it cannot prevent you. It has no defense against</div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s2_21">you. So the person who is violent to others, at least is violent to someone who has the right to defend</div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s2_21">himself and can be violent in return. But the person who is violent with himself is really cunning,</div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s2_21">very cunning. He has found the most innocent victim in the world, defenseless. You can do anything</div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s2_21">you want to your own body.</div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s2_21">There have been monks who have been beating their body every morning, till the blood starts</div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s2_21">oozing all over the body. And they were thought to be great saints! There was one Christian saint in</div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s2_21">Alexandria who remained on a sixty-foot-high pillar – on top of it there was space enough just to sit.</div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s2_21">For thirty years he remained sitting on that pillar. He was sleeping there; people were sending food</div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s2_21">and he was pulling the food up by rope. He was defecating, urinating from the pillar... but this was</div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s2_21">thought to be great austerity. And from hundreds of miles people would come to pay respect to this</div>
<div id="th_21" class="t s2_21">madman. He had no other quality, but even kings came to pay respect to him. What was he doing?</div>
<div id="ti_21" class="t s2_21">Just torturing himself.</div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s2_21">I have seen in India so many people torturing themselves in so many ways that it became absolutely</div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s2_21">clear to me that all the religions up to now have been dominated by sado-masochists.</div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s2_21">There is no question about it. These religions give enough evidence that the people who founded</div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s2_21">the religions and the people who followed the religions were sado-masochists.</div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s2_21">I came across a man who was standing for many years. Now, you cannot stand very long; he was</div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s2_21">standing for many years. All his body had shrunk. His whole weight had gone into the legs; the</div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s2_21">legs had become elephant legs. Now even if he wanted to sit, it was impossible. He had to sleep</div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s2_21">standing. Just in front of him there was a wooden support hanging from the ceiling. He would put</div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s2_21">his hands on the support and sleep that way, and the whole day also he was standing that way. And</div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s2_21">thousands of people were worshipping him.</div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s2_21">I asked them, ”What quality is there that you are worshipping? Is it just because he is standing?</div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s2_21">Just because he is an idiot? What has he gained by standing? lust look at his face! Has he ever</div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s2_21">said a single thing which has any meaning?” He was a very ordinary man. But he managed, just</div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s2_21">by standing, to become a great sage. Now, this man is non-violent to everybody but himself This is</div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s2_21">sheer violence. And I cannot conceive, if you have reverence for life, how you can destroy your own</div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s2_21">life in this way.</div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s2_21">Jainism is the only religion which allows a monk, if he wills it, to fast unto death. They don’t call it</div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s2_21">suicide, they have a very beautiful name for it: santhara. Santhara means one who has dropped the</div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s2_21">lust for life, who has gone beyond the lust for living. Many Jaina monks die every year by santhara.</div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s2_21">The government cannot do anything because it is their religious practice. The secular government</div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s2_21">is not supposed to interfere in anybody’s religion. And they don’t commit suicide by taking poison or</div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s2_21">killing themselves with a sword – no, they have a very torturous method. An electric chair would be</div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s2_21">far more non-violent – you just sit on it and you are gone, you may not even feel it. Or you can be</div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s2_21">put under chloroform, so you don’t even feel when you are and when you are not.</div>
<div id="t17_21" class="t s2_21">From Ignorance to Innocence</div>
<div id="t18_21" class="t s2_21">21</div>
<div id="t19_21" class="t s3_21">Osho</div>
