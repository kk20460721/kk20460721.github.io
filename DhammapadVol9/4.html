<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">Psychologists go on saying: First seek ye the kingdom of Freud, Jung, Adler, Pavlov, </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">Skinner and company, and then all else shall be added unto you. It never happens; it </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">has never happened yet to a single individual. It can't happen in the very nature of </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">things. Even Freud knows no meaning, lives without meaning, lives deep down in </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">despair. He says that there is no hope for man, that man can never be happy, it is </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">impossible. It must be his own understanding, his own experience of life. He says that </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">at the most we can help man to be less miserable, that's all. What kind of goal is this? -- </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">helping man to be a little less miserable! It is not very appealing. </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">Man needs blissfulness, not less miserableness. Man needs something positive -- </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">something to live for and something to die for, something so full of worth that even life </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">can be sacrificed to it. But it should not be arbitrary. There are many arbitrary </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">meanings. </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">Adolf Hitler gave Germany an arbitrary meaning: Live for the Aryan race, live for the </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">pure Nordic blood, because you are born to rule the world. He gave great hope, but it </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">flopped. It was bound to happen. He himself committed suicide; that was almost </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">destined. </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">Religions go on giving false meanings to your life. They go on talking of the other life, </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">the beyond: "After death there is paradise for those who are virtuous and there is hell </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">for those who are not virtuous." And who is virtuous? The person who follows the </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">priest is the virtuous person. The person who does not follow the tradition, the </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">convention, the person who is not a conformist, is bound for hell. </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">Yes, out of fear and greed you can give a little meaning to life, but it is so arbitrary, so </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">artificial, that there is not a single individual on the earth who is so stupid that sooner </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">or later he will not see the falsity of it. </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">And now man has come of age; hence religions are disappearing. There is no possibility </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">in the future for Christianity, for Islam, for Hinduism, for Judaism, to exist. And if they </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">want to exist they will have to change their whole outlook, their very foundations. </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">But there is every possibility for Buddha and his message to prevail. In fact, his day has </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">come. He came twenty-five centuries ahead of his time. Now is the time, the right time </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">for him. He does not talk of fear, he does not talk of greed, he does not talk of hell and </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">heaven, he does not talk even about God. He is so modern, so contemporary; he belongs </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">to our century. Even we are not so contemporary as he is. He destroys all the old </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">structures. He frees religion from all frozen ideologies. He brings many revolutionary </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">changes in the religious outlook. </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">First he says there is no need to be knowledgeable; one has to be innocent. It is through </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">innocence that the truth is known, not through knowledge. </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">A neighbor was saying, "Your cat was making an awful noise last night." </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">The other replied, "You are right. Ever since she ate the canary, she thinks she can sing." </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">You can go on eating the scriptures; you will not be able to sing at all. You can know all </div>
