<div id="t1_30" class="t s1_30">Jesus decided to return to earth. He had seen that in America there was a resurgence of </div>
<div id="t2_30" class="t s1_30">Jesus freaks and born-again baptists, so he thought it was a good time to come. He </div>
<div id="t3_30" class="t s1_30">brought Peter along with him. </div>
<div id="t4_30" class="t s1_30">When he came to Earth he made the announcement that he was Jesus, the Son of God. </div>
<div id="t5_30" class="t s1_30">No one would believe him; they thought he was some kind of nut. So Jesus asked Peter, </div>
<div id="t6_30" class="t s1_30">"How can I get them to believe me, to convince them that I am the true savior?" </div>
<div id="t7_30" class="t s1_30">Peter said, "Remember that trick you did in Galilee, when you walked across the water? </div>
<div id="t8_30" class="t s1_30">I bet that would work." </div>
<div id="t9_30" class="t s1_30">So they made a press announcement that tomorrow Jesus would walk on water. On the </div>
<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">next day, the television and newspapers were at the lake to watch Jesus walk on water. </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">Jesus and Peter arrived and rowed out to the middle of the lake, then Jesus climbed </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">over the side of the boat and immediately sank. When he came back up, Peter, in shock, </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">asked, "What happened? Why did you sink?" </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">"Shut up, you fool!" said Jesus. "The last time I did this I didn't have these damned holes </div>
<div id="tf_30" class="t s1_30">in my feet!" </div>
<div id="tg_30" class="t s1_30">Things are more difficult than they were in the time of Jesus and Buddha! But I am </div>
<div id="th_30" class="t s1_30">enjoying, I am having a good time. Zareen, don't be worried at all. My suggestion is: </div>
<div id="ti_30" class="t s1_30">you should enjoy it. </div>
<div id="tj_30" class="t s1_30">You say, "It somehow infuriates me because it seems so far from the actual facts." </div>
<div id="tk_30" class="t s1_30">Don't feel infuriated, don't feel angry -- that won't help. My people have to learn to </div>
<div id="tl_30" class="t s1_30">laugh at all these stupid things that are bound to become more and more intense. As my </div>
<div id="tm_30" class="t s1_30">work deepens, more and more nonsense rumors will go around -- which will have </div>
<div id="tn_30" class="t s1_30">nothing to do with the facts. Or, even if they have something to do with the facts, they </div>
<div id="to_30" class="t s1_30">will distort them. </div>
<div id="tp_30" class="t s1_30">People are going to invent many kinds of stories. If you become infuriated, in a way you </div>
<div id="tq_30" class="t s1_30">help them. That's what they want. That's what they want! -- that if my people become </div>
<div id="tr_30" class="t s1_30">infuriated, angry, then they can crush, destroy you. And, certainly, they can crush and </div>
<div id="ts_30" class="t s1_30">they can destroy you. My people are very few, a chosen few. </div>
<div id="tt_30" class="t s1_30">Don't feel infuriated; otherwise you will be playing into their hands. When such things </div>
<div id="tu_30" class="t s1_30">come to your notice, have a good laugh. Learn to laugh -- respond with laughter! </div>
<div id="tv_30" class="t s1_30">Laughter has to be your protection. And your laughter will make them look stupid. </div>
<div id="tw_30" class="t s1_30">When somebody says something against me, have a good laugh. Pat him on the back, </div>
<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">hug him! Give him a good kiss! </div>
<div id="ty_30" class="t s1_30">That's what Jesus means, really: love your enemies. But I know, it is easy to love your </div>
<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">enemies -- it is more difficult to love your neighbors. So I say, just as Jesus says, again: </div>
<div id="t10_30" class="t s1_30">Love your neighbors. They are the same people! Hug your neighbors; don't just go on </div>
<div id="t11_30" class="t s1_30">loving them spiritually -- express it. When somebody is saying some nonsense thing </div>
<div id="t12_30" class="t s1_30">about me, express your love. Let him feel puzzled -- let him feel either he is mad or you </div>
<div id="t13_30" class="t s1_30">are mad. He will never be able to figure it out, what happened -- why you hugged him. </div>
<div id="t14_30" class="t s1_30">He was not saying such nice things about your master...why did you hug him? That </div>
<div id="t15_30" class="t s1_30">might give him a longing to come and see the master too. When the disciple is doing </div>
<div id="t16_30" class="t s1_30">such a thing it is worth taking the trouble to go and see what is happening there. </div>
