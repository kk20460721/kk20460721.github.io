<div id="t1_56" class="t s1_56">mind may be needed. But when you come across a Jesus or a Buddha the mind </div>
<div id="t2_56" class="t s1_56">falls flat, it bogs down. SOMETHING is too much for it. You cannot think about </div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s1_56">anything, you are as if in a deep shock -- and yet the shock is blissful. That is </div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s1_56">awe. </div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s1_56">The Bible has awe in it -- the quality of putting your mind completely at a stop -- </div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s1_56">but that you will have to reach directly. The missionary, the priest, the bishop, </div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s1_56">they destroy because they start interpreting. They put their minds in it and their </div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s1_56">minds are mediocre. It is as if you are looking at a tremendously beautiful thing </div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s1_56">from the mind of a very stupid man. Or you are looking into a mirror that is </div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s1_56">broken, completely broken -- it has gathered rust, nothing can be mirrored </div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s1_56">perfectly -- and you look in the mirror and see the moon. Distorted. That is how </div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s1_56">it has been happening. </div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s1_56">The Bible is one of the greatest events in the world -- very pure, purer than the </div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s1_56">Bhagavad Gita because the Bhagavad Gita is very refined. The people who </div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s1_56">created it were very cultured and educated, and of course whenever a thing </div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s1_56">becomes very refined it becomes ethereal, unearthly. The Bible is rooted in the </div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s1_56">earth. </div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s1_56">All the prophets of the Bible are people of the earth. Even Jesus moves on the </div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s1_56">earth; he is the son of a carpenter, uneducated, not knowing anything about </div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s1_56">aesthetics, poetics -- nothing. If he speaks poetry, it is because he IS, not knowing </div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s1_56">it at all, a poet. His poetry is raw and wild. </div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus has something of the peasant in him: the wisdom without knowledge. He is </div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s1_56">not a man of knowledge; no university would be willing to confer an honorary </div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s1_56">degree on him, no. He wouldn't fit in at Oxford or Cambridge; he would look </div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s1_56">very foolish in the gowns and clown-like caps. He would look very foolish; he </div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s1_56">wouldn't fit. He belongs to the earth, to the village, to ordinary, plain people. </div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s1_56">Just the other night I was reading a small story, an Arabian story. A man died. </div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s1_56">He had seventeen camels and three sons and he left a will in which, when it was </div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s1_56">opened and read, it was said that one half of the camels should go to the first son, </div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s1_56">one third to the second and one ninth to the third. </div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s1_56">The sons were nonplussed -- what to do? Seventeen camels: one half is to go to </div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s1_56">the first son -- is one to cut one camel in two? And that too won't solve much </div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s1_56">because then one third has to go to the second. That too won't solve much: one </div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s1_56">ninth has to go to the third. Almost all the camels would be killed. </div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s1_56">Of course, they went to the man of the town who was most knowledgeable: the </div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s1_56">Mulla -- the pundit, the scholar, the mathematician. He thought hard, he tried </div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s1_56">hard, but he couldn't find any solution because mathematics is mathematics. He </div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s1_56">said, "I have never divided camels in my life, this whole thing seems to be </div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s1_56">foolish. But you will have to cut them. If the will is to be followed exactly then </div>
<div id="t14_56" class="t s1_56">the camels have to be cut, they have to be divided." </div>
<div id="t15_56" class="t s1_56">The sons were not ready to cut the camels. So what to do? Then somebody </div>
<div id="t16_56" class="t s1_56">suggested, "It is better that you go to someone who knows something about </div>
<div id="t17_56" class="t s1_56">camels, not about mathematics." So they went to the sheikh of the town who was </div>
