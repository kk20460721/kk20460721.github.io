<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">A voice gasped, "Yingle, yangle! You sonofabitch!" </div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">Just look at people's lives. Watch yourself, watch others. Become a watcher, and you </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">will be surprised: everybody is in search of some opportunity. And opportunities are </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">there. People are waiting only for opportunities. If they are not doing some evil, that </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">does not mean that they are good people; it may only be that the opportunity is missing. </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">That is my own observation. </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">When a politician is not in power he is a very good man, a public servant, humble; </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">always ready to bow down and touch your feet; open hospitals and schools. And once </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">he is in power, he is not even ready to recognize you and all that public service </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">disappears. Once he is in power, he has opportunity; now he will do things that he </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">always wanted to do but could not. </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">This has happened in this country in such a crystal-clear way as it has not happened </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">anywhere else. Before independence, just thirty years ago, all these politicians who have </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">become a nuisance to the country were great public servants, great servants of the </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">country, freedom-fighters. They sacrificed much, they lived simple, humble, poor lives, </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">for the freedom of the country. Their lives were an example to be followed, they were </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">ideals; they were worshipped by the people. </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">And then came power -- and within seconds the whole thing changed. They became </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">power-hungry, they became power-possessed. Their faces changed, their masks </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">disappeared. Now the opportunity was there. </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">Lord Acton has said: Power corrupts. I agree and I don't agree. Yes, superficially it </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">seems that power corrupts, but if you go deep into its analysis it is not power that </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">corrupts -- the person has been corrupted always. Power only gives opportunity; power </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">cannot corrupt. If you are corrupted, then power gives you an opportunity to do that </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">which you always wanted to do but were not able to do. </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">People think it is money that corrupts people. No, money simply gives opportunity. </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">Poor people look so good; it is not so. Just let them become rich and then see... all their </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">goodness disappears. In fact the newly rich people are far more dangerous than those </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">who are born rich, because those who are born rich are accustomed to riches. </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">It is said about a prime minister of a king that he accumulated much wealth illegally, </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">behind the king's back; that he became the richest man in the country. Then the king </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">came to know about it. </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">He called the prime minister and he said, "You have served me well so I cannot punish </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">you because of your services and your devotion, but you have been cheating and you </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">have been accumulating illegal wealth. I will not punish you -- you please resign and </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">leave my country and go wherever you want to go." </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">The prime minister said, "Before I leave I would like to suggest one thing. Now I have </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">all that I need, in fact more than I need, if you appoint another man your prime </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">minister, he will have to accumulate wealth again. He will harm you more. Now I need </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">not harm you at all." </div>
