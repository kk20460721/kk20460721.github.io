<div id="t1_86" class="t s1_86">The richest man in the world, just fifty years ago, was the nizam of Hyderabad -- the </div>
<div id="t2_86" class="t s1_86">richest man in the world. In fact, his riches were so great that nobody has ever been able </div>
<div id="t3_86" class="t s1_86">to estimate how much he had. His treasuries were full of diamonds; everything was </div>
<div id="t4_86" class="t s1_86">made of diamonds. Even his paperweight was the biggest diamond in the world; even </div>
<div id="t5_86" class="t s1_86">the Kohinoor is only one third the size of his paperweight. </div>
<div id="t6_86" class="t s1_86">When he died, his paperweight was found in his shoe. The diamonds were not counted </div>
<div id="t7_86" class="t s1_86">because there were so many. They were weighed, not counted -- how many kilos, not </div>
<div id="t8_86" class="t s1_86">how many diamonds -- who could count? </div>
<div id="t9_86" class="t s1_86">Each year the diamonds were brought out of the basements. He had the biggest palace </div>
<div id="ta_86" class="t s1_86">in India, but all the roofs were not enough, because his diamonds were spread on the </div>
<div id="tb_86" class="t s1_86">roofs of his palace just to give them a little sunlight every year. </div>
<div id="tc_86" class="t s1_86">But the man lived a life of such misery, you cannot believe it; even beggars live far </div>
<div id="td_86" class="t s1_86">better. He used to collect cigarettes which others had already smoked and thrown away </div>
<div id="te_86" class="t s1_86">-- just cigarette ends. He would not purchase cigarettes for himself, he would collect </div>
<div id="tf_86" class="t s1_86">these cigarettes and smoke them. Such a miser! For fifty years he used only one single </div>
<div id="tg_86" class="t s1_86">cap -- it was so dirty and stinking! He died in the same cap. He never used to change his </div>
<div id="th_86" class="t s1_86">clothes. And it is said that he used to purchase his clothes from the secondhand </div>
<div id="ti_86" class="t s1_86">marketplace where old, rotten things, used things, are sold. His shoes must have been </div>
<div id="tj_86" class="t s1_86">the dirtiest in the world, but he would only send them once in a while for repair, he </div>
<div id="tk_86" class="t s1_86">would not purchase new shoes. </div>
<div id="tl_86" class="t s1_86">Now, the richest man in the world living in such misery and miserliness -- what had </div>
<div id="tm_86" class="t s1_86">happened to this man? Possessiveness! Possessiveness was his disease, his mania. He </div>
<div id="tn_86" class="t s1_86">wanted to possess everything. He would purchase diamonds all over the world; </div>
<div id="to_86" class="t s1_86">wherever there were diamonds his agent was there to purchase them. Just have more </div>
<div id="tp_86" class="t s1_86">and more! But you cannot eat diamonds -- and he was eating the poorest kind of food. </div>
<div id="tq_86" class="t s1_86">He was so afraid that he was unable to sleep at all -- constant fear that somebody might </div>
<div id="tr_86" class="t s1_86">steal from him. </div>
<div id="ts_86" class="t s1_86">That's how the paperweight -- the costliest diamond that he had, three times more in </div>
<div id="tt_86" class="t s1_86">weight than the Kohinoor -- was found in his shoe. When he was dying he had hidden </div>
<div id="tu_86" class="t s1_86">it in his shoe so nobody could steal it -- otherwise the paperweight would be too visible, </div>
<div id="tv_86" class="t s1_86">too much in the eyes of people. Even dying he was more concerned with the diamond </div>
<div id="tw_86" class="t s1_86">than with his own life. He could never give anything to anybody. </div>
<div id="tx_86" class="t s1_86">This happens to people who become possessive: they don't use things, they are used by </div>
<div id="ty_86" class="t s1_86">things. They are not masters, they are servants of their own things. They go on </div>
<div id="tz_86" class="t s1_86">accumulating and they die without ever having enjoyed all that they had. </div>
<div id="t10_86" class="t s1_86">Buddha says: LIVE IN JOY, WITHOUT POSSESSIONS, LIKE THE SHINING ONES. </div>
<div id="t11_86" class="t s1_86">Live like the buddhas, who don't possess a thing but can use everything. The world has </div>
<div id="t12_86" class="t s1_86">to be used, not possessed. We come empty-handed and we go empty-handed, so there </div>
<div id="t13_86" class="t s1_86">is no point in possessing anything. To be possessive is ugly -- but use everything! While </div>
<div id="t14_86" class="t s1_86">you are, use the world, enjoy everything that the world makes available, and then go </div>
<div id="t15_86" class="t s1_86">without looking back, without clinging to things. </div>
<div id="t16_86" class="t s1_86">This is the way of the buddhas. AES DHAMMO SANANTANO: this is the </div>
<div id="t17_86" class="t s1_86">inexhaustible law of the buddhas. Then a buddha can be a beggar if he chooses to be so </div>
