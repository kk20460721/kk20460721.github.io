<div id="t1_8" class="t s1_8">That's why my insistence is that none of my sannyasins are to leave the ordinary world. </div>
<div id="t2_8" class="t s1_8">They have to become enlightened in the ordinary world so that this excuse, this </div>
<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">traditional excuse, can be dropped forever. </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">And there have been people who have become enlightened living very ordinary lives. </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">Kabir was a father and a husband, and he worked his whole life -- he was a weaver -- </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">yet he became enlightened. He didn't renounce the world, he didn't escape. Or Raidas, </div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s1_8">he was a shoemaker. He continued his work, he remained in the world, and became </div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">enlightened. </div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">And there have been many, but you will be surprised: priests don't talk much about </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">these people because these people are dangerous. They talk about the renunciation of </div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s1_8">Buddha, that he renounced the world, went into the forest; they talk about Mahavira </div>
<div id="tc_8" class="t s1_8">who renounced his kingdom. In the first place you have to have a kingdom to renounce. </div>
<div id="td_8" class="t s1_8">Where is the kingdom? And if you don't have the kingdom, then in this life at least you </div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s1_8">can't become enlightened. Even if you have the kingdom, then you have to renounce it. </div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s1_8">Jesus is presented in such a way that it becomes almost impossible to conceive of him as </div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s1_8">a human being. He is born out of a virgin mother -- now, what nonsense! You are not </div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s1_8">born out of a virgin mother, so at least this life you have missed the train. Next life </div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">choose a virgin mother, because everything starts from there! In the first place you have </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">chosen a wrong train</div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">....</div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">But there are difficulties: if you choose a virgin mother you are </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">a bastard. If Jesus chooses a virgin mother he is simply exceptional -- it is God's grace. </div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s1_8">The priests have been trying to create a distance between you and the enlightened ones </div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s1_8">so that you can feel at ease. And the effort of all the buddhas is not to let you feel at </div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s1_8">ease, is to make you restless, to make you divinely discontented, to make you aware </div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s1_8">that you are capable of tremendous bliss and you are missing it, to make you alert that </div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s1_8">it is your birthright and yet you have not claimed it. </div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s1_8">A MAN IS NOT BORN TO MASTERY. </div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s1_8">A MASTER IS NEVER PROUD. </div>
<div id="tu_8" class="t s1_8">But Buddha immediately in the second sutra says something very significant, because </div>
<div id="tv_8" class="t s1_8">there is every possibility that he will be misunderstood -- hence the second statement. </div>
<div id="tw_8" class="t s1_8">He says that mastery is an achievement, but not in the ordinary sense of the word, </div>
<div id="tx_8" class="t s1_8">because whenever you achieve something you become proud; you say, "I have achieved </div>
<div id="ty_8" class="t s1_8">this." If mastery is an achievement -- which certainly it is -- it is in a totally different </div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s1_8">sense from ordinary achievements. It is not like becoming a president of a country or </div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">becoming the richest man in the world; it is not like becoming famous -- it is totally </div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s1_8">different. The difference is that in the very achievement of it the achiever dies. </div>
<div id="t12_8" class="t s1_8">Remember it, never forget about it; otherwise your spirituality can also become a new </div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s1_8">ego trip. Hence, immediately, Buddha adds: A MASTER IS NEVER PROUD. He cannot </div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s1_8">be -- because he is no more! This is a very strange achievement: in the very process of </div>
<div id="t15_8" class="t s1_8">achieving it, the ego melts, disappears. In fact it happens only when the ego is found no </div>
<div id="t16_8" class="t s1_8">more. It is a very paradoxical achievement: an achievement certainly, but there is no </div>
