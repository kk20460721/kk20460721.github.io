<div id="t5_149" class="t s1_149">ARE WRONG. And when you don't question and silently act, samadhi is not far </div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s1_149">away. Questions come from the mind and whatever answers are given, your </div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s1_149">mind rejoices in becoming more and more knowledgeable. It becomes more and </div>

<div id="tj_149" class="t s1_149">is only Bodhidharma alone, who talks about six senses. And the sixth sense is </div>

<div id="to_149" class="t s1_149">you will immediately lose balance. When you see a drunkard coming home in </div>
