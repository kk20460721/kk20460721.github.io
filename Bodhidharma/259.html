<div id="t1_259" class="t s1_259">called the VEDAS "just rubbish." And the VEDAS were so much respected by the </div>
<div id="t2_259" class="t s1_259">Hindus that anybody calling them rubbish must have had great courage. He did </div>
<div id="t3_259" class="t s1_259">not accept any Hindu AVATARA, any Hindu incarnation, as having any value. </div>
<div id="t4_259" class="t s1_259">For example, Parasurama is one of the Hindu incarnations of God. He was the </div>
<div id="t5_259" class="t s1_259">son of a man who was thought to be a great seer, but he was suspicious ...as all </div>
<div id="t6_259" class="t s1_259">husbands are suspicious about their wives, and all wives are automatically </div>
<div id="t7_259" class="t s1_259">suspicious of their husbands. That is their only relationship. Finally the father </div>
<div id="t8_259" class="t s1_259">became so convinced of his suspicion -- which may have had grounds or may not </div>
<div id="t9_259" class="t s1_259">have had grounds, he could not be certain on this point -- that he ordered his </div>
<div id="ta_259" class="t s1_259">son, Parasurama, to cut off his mother's head and bring it to him. And Prasurama </div>
<div id="tb_259" class="t s1_259">went, without asking why. It was not a small thing! He cut off his mother's head </div>
<div id="tc_259" class="t s1_259">and brought it to his father. </div>
<div id="td_259" class="t s1_259">Then the father told him, "I have been suspecting her, but now I have certain </div>
<div id="te_259" class="t s1_259">evidence that she has been in love with a man who is a great warrior." </div>
<div id="tf_259" class="t s1_259">Parasurama and his family belonged to the caste of the brahmins. Parasurama </div>
<div id="tg_259" class="t s1_259">said, "Don't you be worried. I will not leave a single man of the warrior caste </div>
<div id="th_259" class="t s1_259">alive." </div>
<div id="ti_259" class="t s1_259">The story may be exaggerated, but it shows the quality of the man. It shows that </div>
<div id="tj_259" class="t s1_259">he killed all the warriors of the whole world many, many times. And from where </div>
<div id="tk_259" class="t s1_259">were these new warriors coming? The Hindu society accepts a very strange </div>
<div id="tl_259" class="t s1_259">thing, and nobody ever considers </div>
<div id="tm_259" class="t s1_259">....</div>
<div id="tn_259" class="t s1_259">They go on claiming they have a great </div>
<div id="to_259" class="t s1_259">culture, but they never look at its foundation; their culture is just a phony name. </div>
<div id="tp_259" class="t s1_259">The Hindu society accepted that if a woman came to a brahmin seer and asked </div>
<div id="tq_259" class="t s1_259">that she be given a child, then it was obligatory for the brahmin seer to make love </div>
<div id="tr_259" class="t s1_259">to her and make her pregnant. He could not reject her. So Parasurama went on </div>
<div id="ts_259" class="t s1_259">cutting off the heads of the warriors; the widows were left, and they were going </div>
<div id="tt_259" class="t s1_259">to the seers </div>
<div id="tu_259" class="t s1_259">....</div>
<div id="tv_259" class="t s1_259">It was a good business, a great conspiracy! </div>
<div id="tw_259" class="t s1_259">The whole country was in a state of prostitution, and Parasurama was killing. </div>
<div id="tx_259" class="t s1_259">Such violence cannot be accepted as a quality of God. And it seems illogical ... If </div>
<div id="ty_259" class="t s1_259">his mother was in love with a warrior, he could just have killed him -- we can </div>
<div id="tz_259" class="t s1_259">make a few concessions, because he was thought by the Hindus to be an </div>
<div id="t10_259" class="t s1_259">incarnation of God. But to kill all the warriors of the world, not even of this </div>
<div id="t11_259" class="t s1_259">country, does not seem to have any logic behind it. And it was not certain that </div>
<div id="t12_259" class="t s1_259">what the father was saying ... Parasurama should have asked for evidence, for </div>
<div id="t13_259" class="t s1_259">proof. His father may have been just a jealous man. </div>
<div id="t14_259" class="t s1_259">Now Buddha could not accept Parasurama as a reincarnation of God, and if </div>
<div id="t15_259" class="t s1_259">Parasurama is a reincarnation of God then who will be the reincarnation of the </div>
<div id="t16_259" class="t s1_259">devil? Buddha could not accept Rama as and incarnation of God because Rama </div>
<div id="t17_259" class="t s1_259">killed a sudra, a young man, by pouring hot liquid lead into his ears because he </div>
<div id="t18_259" class="t s1_259">had been listening while hiding behind a tree when a few brahmins were reciting </div>
<div id="t19_259" class="t s1_259">the VEDAS. The sudras were not allowed to read; they were not allowed even to </div>
<div id="t1a_259" class="t s1_259">listen! What kind of culture has this country created, where one-fourth of the </div>
<div id="t1b_259" class="t s1_259">people are not even allowed to listen to its religious scriptures? </div>
