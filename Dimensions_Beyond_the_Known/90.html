<div id="t1_90" class="t s1_90">CHAPTER 5. FROM CHILDHOOD TO ENLIGHTENMENT, THE BIRTH OF A NEW MAN</div>
<div id="t2_90" class="t s2_90">someone does meet me, it makes me very happy, but I do not become unhappy due to not meeting</div>
<div id="t3_90" class="t s2_90">someone. For the state of ultimate joy, I believe that only my grandfather’s death was responsible.</div>
<div id="t4_90" class="t s2_90">That death threw me back to myself permanently. I have not been able to revert back from the center.</div>
<div id="t5_90" class="t s2_90">Due to this condition of being an outsider, a stranger, I have seen a new dimension of experience. It</div>
<div id="t6_90" class="t s2_90">is a condition in which, although I am amidst everything, I continue to remain outside.</div>
<div id="t7_90" class="t s2_90">I became a universe unto myself. This new experience – and a strange one at that – gave me a sort</div>
<div id="t8_90" class="t s2_90">of pain, although it was a joyous pain. It was like this: that at that young age I began to feel and</div>
<div id="t9_90" class="t s2_90">experience a sort of maturity and elderliness. In this experience there was no ego involvement, but</div>
<div id="ta_90" class="t s2_90">an individuality was still there, and that placed me in some embarrassing situations.</div>
<div id="tb_90" class="t s2_90">For example, I could not accept anyone as my teacher though I was always ready to be a student.</div>
<div id="tc_90" class="t s2_90">But I did not ﬁnd anyone whom I could call my master. Everyone I found was very much involved in</div>
<div id="td_90" class="t s2_90">and with life. No one who had not seen death could ever become my teacher. I wanted to respect,</div>
<div id="te_90" class="t s2_90">but I could not. I could respect rivers, mountains and even stones, but not human beings. This was</div>
<div id="tf_90" class="t s2_90">a very embarrassing situation, and it put me in great difﬁculties.</div>
<div id="tg_90" class="t s2_90">I met no such teacher whom I could spontaneously respect, because I never felt that there was</div>
<div id="th_90" class="t s2_90">anything which anyone knew which was such an absolute truth that without it life could have no</div>
<div id="ti_90" class="t s2_90">meaning. Many times I have felt that various teachers were saying and doing things which looked</div>
<div id="tj_90" class="t s2_90">childish – which even I, at that age, would not say or do. Therefore, I had never felt that I was a</div>
<div id="tk_90" class="t s2_90">small child and that I should remain under someone’s protection and guidance. Not that I did not go</div>
<div id="tl_90" class="t s2_90">to anyone: I did go to many people, but I always returned empty-handed and felt that all which was</div>
<div id="tm_90" class="t s2_90">imparted I also knew. There was nothing which could be learned from them.</div>
<div id="tn_90" class="t s2_90">Therefore, a difﬁculty arose in that many a time others felt that I was egoistic. It was natural for them</div>
<div id="to_90" class="t s2_90">to feel that way because I was not able to respect and honor anyone or to obey anyone’s command.</div>
<div id="tp_90" class="t s2_90">Everyone felt that I was an immodest and seditious rebel. Up to a particular age, to my teachers, to</div>
<div id="tq_90" class="t s2_90">my elders and to everybody, I have been a discourteous, rebellious, seditious and egoistic person,</div>
<div id="tr_90" class="t s2_90">and they had no hope that I would ever be of any use to anyone in life.</div>
<div id="ts_90" class="t s2_90">In whatsoever they had put simple faith I could not put any faith at all, and that which they never</div>
<div id="tt_90" class="t s2_90">doubted, I always doubted. To whatsoever they had always stood with head bowed down in pranam,</div>
<div id="tu_90" class="t s2_90">I could not even join my hands. I never felt to do so. I never tried to deceive myself, nor did I learn</div>
<div id="tv_90" class="t s2_90">any hypocrisy. If I had no trust, it was so: I could not help it, I did not try to show off anything which</div>
<div id="tw_90" class="t s2_90">I did not believe to be true.</div>
<div id="tx_90" class="t s2_90">Therefore, this created some difﬁculties, but it also had its advantages.</div>
<div id="ty_90" class="t s2_90">I was thrown back upon</div>
<div id="tz_90" class="t s2_90">myself from another direction as well, because I never believed or felt that the truth could be learned</div>
<div id="t10_90" class="t s2_90">from others. There was only one way to learn – to learn from myself only. I therefore never knew</div>
<div id="t11_90" class="t s2_90">anyone to be my guru. I was my guru and my disciple as well. If I could not follow anyone blindly,</div>
<div id="t12_90" class="t s2_90">the only alternative left was to search in my own way. There was no one to show me a way that I</div>
<div id="t13_90" class="t s2_90">might follow. I had to walk by myself.</div>
<div id="t14_90" class="t s2_90">The most valuable result of this was that I had to pave my own way, follow my own discretion, and</div>
<div id="t15_90" class="t s2_90">in every matter make my own decisions. There was no question of taking anyone’s help. This being</div>
<div id="t16_90" class="t s2_90">thrown back again and again upon myself proved very valuable.</div>
<div id="t17_90" class="t s2_90">Dimensions Beyond the Known</div>
<div id="t18_90" class="t s2_90">90</div>
<div id="t19_90" class="t s3_90">Osho</div>
