<div id="t2_104" class="t s1_104">restored statue of Christ stands without hands, and on its base are carved the </div>
<div id="t3_104" class="t s1_104">words: Christ has no hands but ours. </div>
<div id="t4_104" class="t s1_104">Those twelve hands all betrayed: one positively, eleven negatively. And Christ </div>
<div id="t5_104" class="t s1_104">has no hands except ours, because Christ is a being, PURE being. And all that is </div>
<div id="t6_104" class="t s1_104">to be done is to be done through us, through the hands. In that moment, when </div>
<div id="t7_104" class="t s1_104">Judas betrayed and the remaining eleven fled, Jesus was left without hands, a </div>
<div id="t8_104" class="t s1_104">pure being. In fact, that moment was the moment of crucifixion. The next day, it </div>
<div id="t9_104" class="t s1_104">was nothing new. In that moment, the hands of Christ were cut. In that moment, </div>
<div id="ta_104" class="t s1_104">the real crucifixion happened. The next day was just a repetition of it in more </div>
<div id="tb_104" class="t s1_104">materialistic terms, but spiritually, Jesus was left without hands. </div>
<div id="tc_104" class="t s1_104">WHEN THE MORNING WAS COME, ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS </div>

<div id="ti_104" class="t s1_104">HIM: THOU SAYEST. </div>
<div id="tj_104" class="t s1_104">Jesus was tremendously misunderstood whenever he talked about the kingdom </div>
<div id="tk_104" class="t s1_104">of God. He never talked about the kingdom of this earth. Whenever he said,'I am </div>
<div id="tl_104" class="t s1_104">the King of the Jews,' he never meant to assert any throne on this earth. He was </div>
<div id="tm_104" class="t s1_104">saying something very symbolically. He was saying that he was the cream of the </div>
<div id="tn_104" class="t s1_104">Jewish genius. He was saying that he was the heart of the Jewish race. He was </div>
<div id="to_104" class="t s1_104">saying that he was the flower of the Jewish tree of life. When he said that he was </div>
<div id="tp_104" class="t s1_104">the king, he never meant that he was the king politically. </div>
<div id="tq_104" class="t s1_104">But this is always so: you have to use the language of the people you are talking </div>
<div id="tr_104" class="t s1_104">to, and that very language which you wanted to communicate with becomes the </div>
<div id="ts_104" class="t s1_104">barrier, becomes the cause of all misunderstanding. </div>
<div id="tt_104" class="t s1_104">The people understood the superficial meaning of his words. Had they been a </div>
<div id="tu_104" class="t s1_104">little more in tune with themselves, had they been a little more silent, had they </div>
<div id="tv_104" class="t s1_104">been a little more meditative and prayerful, they would have understood what </div>

<div id="tx_104" class="t s1_104">Many times I say things to you and immediately I feel that you must have </div>

<div id="tz_104" class="t s1_104">my meaning -- because the meaning is a silent shadow that follows the word. </div>
