<div id="t2_40" class="t s1_40">are afraid that if YOU don't dominate, the other is going to dominate you. </div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s1_40">And for all those who want to dominate others, Machiavelli is the teacher. In India also </div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s1_40">a similar type of man has existed; his name was Chanakya. He preceded Machiavelli by </div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s1_40">thousands of years. Both men are the foundations of the extrovert mind; they have laid </div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s1_40">the foundations. And their first foundation is: the best way to defend yourself is to </div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s1_40">attack. Hence, before the other attacks you, attack the other. Before your wife starts </div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s1_40">dominating you, you dominate her, or before your husband starts dominating you, you </div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s1_40">dominate him. </div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s1_40">A young man was going to get married. He asked his father, "Is there any advice for </div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s1_40">me?" And the father whispered something into his ear. The young man laughed and </div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s1_40">said, "I will take care of it." </div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s1_40">He went to the town to get married. As the couple were coming back to the village, the </div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s1_40">horse who was carrying them from the town stopped. The young man was very angry. </div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s1_40">He said to the horse, "This is the first time -- I can forgive you, but remember, I can </div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s1_40">forgive you only two times." </div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s1_40">The horse moved, but again he stopped at another place and wouldn't budge. The </div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s1_40">young man said, "This is the second time -- now be alert!" </div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s1_40">And when the horse stopped for the third time, the young man got down, took his </div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s1_40">pistol and shot the horse immediately then and there. The horse fell down. </div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s1_40">The wife could not believe her eyes -- what cruelty! She said, "What are you doing?" </div>

<div id="tq_40" class="t s1_40">This has been the way down the ages: either the husband dominates or the wife. In </div>

<div id="ts_40" class="t s1_40">dominate in the outside world, in the marketplace. He comes home so tired, he comes </div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s1_40">home so frustrated, he has no desire, will or power to fight with the woman. And the </div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s1_40">woman has been waiting the whole day, accumulating. Her energies are fresh and she </div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s1_40">has nowhere to go to dominate anybody else; only the husband is her dominion. </div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s1_40">Man has imprisoned woman in the house at a great cost, because he has taken away all </div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s1_40">other possibilities of going on ego trips. Now only one outlet is left -- he himself -- and </div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s1_40">he is suffering a lot. In fact, the Women's Liberation movement is not only woman's </div>
<div id="tz_40" class="t s1_40">liberation; if it really happens, it will be far more MAN'S liberation. Hence I don't see </div>
<div id="t10_40" class="t s1_40">any intelligent man against it; all intelligent men are for it, because they know if the </div>
<div id="t11_40" class="t s1_40">woman really becomes free they will be free too. It is going to be freedom for both. </div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s1_40">It is one of the laws of life: either you both can be free or you both will be slaves. It is not </div>

<div id="t14_40" class="t s1_40">the master is always a slave of his own slave, because his mastery also depends on the </div>
