<div id="t2_58" class="t s1_58">dissatisfied being. You will almost become a beggar, begging and begging -- and feeling </div>
<div id="t3_58" class="t s1_58">guilty and feeling bad, almost like a criminal. Just because of an attitude. It seems that </div>
<div id="t4_58" class="t s1_58">you have been influenced too much by religious people, by the church, by the temple, by </div>
<div id="t5_58" class="t s1_58">the priest. </div>
<div id="t6_58" class="t s1_58">Let me tell you one anecdote. </div>
<div id="t7_58" class="t s1_58">An old-time physician whose son had just graduated from medical school decided to pass </div>
<div id="t8_58" class="t s1_58">on some tips about the profession. One day his son accompanied his father while. he was </div>
<div id="t9_58" class="t s1_58">making his hospital rounds. The first patient they called on was advised by his father to </div>
<div id="ta_58" class="t s1_58">cut down on smoking. "How did you manage to come to that conclusion?" asked the son. </div>
<div id="tb_58" class="t s1_58">"Just look around the room and observe the large number of cigarette ends," was his </div>
<div id="tc_58" class="t s1_58">answer. </div>
<div id="td_58" class="t s1_58">The second patient was told to stop eating so much chocolate. Again the new doctor was </div>
<div id="te_58" class="t s1_58">bewildered. "How come?" he said. </div>
<div id="tf_58" class="t s1_58">"You don't look," said the father. "If you had you would notice the large number of </div>
<div id="tg_58" class="t s1_58">chocolate boxes all over the place." </div>
<div id="th_58" class="t s1_58">"I think I have got the idea now," said the son. "Let me try the next one." </div>
<div id="ti_58" class="t s1_58">A woman, who was the third patient, was informed by the son to cut down on things </div>
<div id="tj_58" class="t s1_58">involving the church, religion, and priests. The amazed father asked his son what led him </div>
<div id="tk_58" class="t s1_58">to that strange conclusion, since the church had not even been mentioned in the </div>
<div id="tl_58" class="t s1_58">conversation, and you cannot find churches all over the place. </div>
<div id="tm_58" class="t s1_58">"Well Dad, it was like this," said the son. "Did you notice that I dropped the </div>
<div id="tn_58" class="t s1_58">thermometer? When I bent down to pick it up I could not help noticing the preacher </div>
<div id="to_58" class="t s1_58">under the bed." </div>
<div id="tp_58" class="t s1_58">That's what I also notice: under your bed is the preacher, over your bed is the preacher, </div>
<div id="tq_58" class="t s1_58">all around the place are temples and churches. Cut down, become a little more free. </div>
<div id="tr_58" class="t s1_58">"Most of the time I feel sexual and my eyes remain seeking the other. And also I am too </div>
<div id="ts_58" class="t s1_58">much in the mind." You have to be then. Because if you fight with sex, where else will </div>
<div id="tt_58" class="t s1_58">you gO? Then the whole sex will become a mind thing. Then it will move into the head. </div>
<div id="tu_58" class="t s1_58">Then you will think about it, fantasize about it, dream about it. And those dreams cannot </div>
<div id="tv_58" class="t s1_58">be satisfying because no dream can be satisfying about food. You can go on fantasizing </div>
<div id="tw_58" class="t s1_58">about food and being invited to the palaces of the kings, but that is not going to help. </div>
<div id="tx_58" class="t s1_58">When you will be out of a dream you will again feel hungry, more so. After the dream </div>
<div id="ty_58" class="t s1_58">you will feel more dissatisfied -- and again and again, because you are avoiding an </div>
<div id="tz_58" class="t s1_58">actuality, a reality of life, a fact, which has to be accepted, used, creatively transformed. </div>
<div id="t10_58" class="t s1_58">I know one day it is possible your energy will move in sahasrar but let it move as a </div>
<div id="t11_58" class="t s1_58">mature energy. One day sex will simply disappear from your life; then you will not think </div>
<div id="t12_58" class="t s1_58">about it. Then it will no longer be a fantasy to you. It will simply disappear. When you </div>
<div id="t13_58" class="t s1_58">have achieved the higher orgasm of the same energy, the lower orgasms have no appeal. </div>
<div id="t14_58" class="t s1_58">But up to then it is going to become a head thing. </div>
<div id="t15_58" class="t s1_58">And it is good if sex is in the genitals because that is the right place where it should be. If </div>
<div id="t16_58" class="t s1_58">it is in the head, then you are in a mess. Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples that if each </div>
<div id="t17_58" class="t s1_58">chakra functions where it should function, a man remains healthy. When chakras overlap </div>
<div id="t18_58" class="t s1_58">and the natural locus is lost and energy moves in a haphazard way</div>
<div id="t19_58" class="t s1_58">....</div>
