<div id="t1_114" class="t s1_114">Then Ananda was approached. He was the only one who had lived with Buddha for </div>
<div id="t2_114" class="t s1_114">forty-two years and was not yet enlightened. He had remembered all, everything; he </div>
<div id="t3_114" class="t s1_114">had the whole collection, word for word. His memory must have been just </div>
<div id="t4_114" class="t s1_114">extraordinary. But there was a problem. The problem was: can you believe in the words </div>
<div id="t5_114" class="t s1_114">of an unenlightened person about an enlightened person? </div>
<div id="t6_114" class="t s1_114">Those who are enlightened are not ready to say anything; the one who is ready to </div>
<div id="t7_114" class="t s1_114">reproduce the whole philosophy, word for word, from the beginning to the end, from </div>
<div id="t8_114" class="t s1_114">the first statement that Buddha made to the last... but he is not enlightened. Can you </div>
<div id="t9_114" class="t s1_114">rely on his memory? Can you rely on his interpretation? Now, this is really an insoluble </div>
<div id="ta_114" class="t s1_114">problem: those who know, those who can be relied upon, are not ready to say anything, </div>
<div id="tb_114" class="t s1_114">and the one who is ready to say cannot be relied upon -- he is not enlightened himself. </div>
<div id="tc_114" class="t s1_114">Then the whole gathering told Ananda, "Do one thing -- don't waste a single moment. </div>
<div id="td_114" class="t s1_114">Bring your total energies and become as alert as possible. If you can become </div>
<div id="te_114" class="t s1_114">enlightened before your death, then something is possible. We will not collect your </div>
<div id="tf_114" class="t s1_114">statements unless you are enlightened. You remember -- you are the only one who </div>
<div id="tg_114" class="t s1_114">remembers absolutely -- but we cannot trust it." </div>
<div id="th_114" class="t s1_114">How can you trust a blind man's report about someone who had eyes and was talking </div>
<div id="ti_114" class="t s1_114">about colors, light, rainbows, flowers? How can you believe in the report of a blind </div>
<div id="tj_114" class="t s1_114">man? It is absurd, it cannot be believed! </div>
<div id="tk_114" class="t s1_114">So the congregation prayed to Ananda, "You are the only hope. If you can become </div>
<div id="tl_114" class="t s1_114">enlightened we will be able to accept whatsoever you say, but we will not be able to </div>
<div id="tm_114" class="t s1_114">accept it unless you become enlightened." </div>
<div id="tn_114" class="t s1_114">Ananda had lived for forty-two years with Buddha, but because Buddha was so close to </div>
<div id="to_114" class="t s1_114">him he had started taking him for granted. It happens. It happens here too. Many of you </div>
<div id="tp_114" class="t s1_114">who are close to me can start taking me for granted. Ananda was very close, the closest </div>
<div id="tq_114" class="t s1_114">one; he was not much concerned about his enlightenment. Whenever he was told he </div>
<div id="tr_114" class="t s1_114">said, "I am not worried about it. Buddha is going to take care of me. I have been serving </div>
<div id="ts_114" class="t s1_114">him for forty-two years -- is he not compassionate enough to help drag me out of the </div>
<div id="tt_114" class="t s1_114">darkness? He will do it. And what is the hurry? Why be in such a haste? It can happen </div>
<div id="tu_114" class="t s1_114">tomorrow, it can happen the day after tomorrow. Buddha is there." </div>
<div id="tv_114" class="t s1_114">And for forty-two years he had been postponing and believing deep down in his heart </div>
<div id="tw_114" class="t s1_114">that, "Buddha will do it. Although he says nobody can make anybody else enlightened, </div>
<div id="tx_114" class="t s1_114">I know he can do it. I know miracles have been happening around him. And at least, if </div>
<div id="ty_114" class="t s1_114">not for anybody else, for me he is going to make an exception. I have served him so </div>
<div id="tz_114" class="t s1_114">much. And then he is always there; if today I miss, tomorrow; if tomorrow I miss, the </div>
<div id="t10_114" class="t s1_114">day after tomorrow. Where is he going? He is always there." </div>
<div id="t11_114" class="t s1_114">The day Buddha died, he said to Ananda, "Ananda, now I will not be here tomorrow. </div>
<div id="t12_114" class="t s1_114">So make haste, hurry! Now no more postponing." </div>
<div id="t13_114" class="t s1_114">And it happened that after Buddha's death, when the congregation prayed to Ananda, </div>
<div id="t14_114" class="t s1_114">for twenty-four hours he sat with closed eyes. This was for the first time in his whole </div>
<div id="t15_114" class="t s1_114">life. In fact, there was so much happening around Buddha that it was impossible to </div>
<div id="t16_114" class="t s1_114">close the eyes. The whole day so many things were happening and Ananda was too </div>
<div id="t17_114" class="t s1_114">occupied. Now Buddha was gone and nothing was happening anymore, there was </div>
