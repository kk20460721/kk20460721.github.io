<div id="t1_352" class="t s1_352">CHAPTER 24. SPIRITUALITY IS NOT FOR SALE</div>
<div id="t2_352" class="t s2_352">Pontius Pilate also could not see the point. What was the problem? – Jesus was only saying strange</div>
<div id="t3_352" class="t s2_352">things... let him talk; if you did not want to believe in him, he was not forcing you. And nobody was</div>
<div id="t4_352" class="t s2_352">listening to him either; just a few poor people surrounded him in the hope of going toparadise. No</div>
<div id="t5_352" class="t s2_352">educated, cultured people, no scholarly people, no rabbis, no rich people were around him; he was</div>
<div id="t6_352" class="t s2_352">absolutely powerless. He rodeon a donkey, saying that he was the only begotten son of God. Let</div>
<div id="t7_352" class="t s2_352">him enjoy it. Just something in his head is loose – but that should not be a reason to crucify him.</div>
<div id="t8_352" class="t s2_352">But the people did not ask for Jesus to be released; they asked for Barabbas who had committed</div>
<div id="t9_352" class="t s2_352">seven murders, who was really a murderous man.</div>
<div id="ta_352" class="t s2_352">And if you think about miracles, with Jesus</div>
<div id="tb_352" class="t s2_352">nothing happened, no miracle; but with Barabbas miracles happened.</div>
<div id="tc_352" class="t s2_352">This was a miracle: after</div>
<div id="td_352" class="t s2_352">seven murders the people asked that Barabbas should be released. Either God missed his target</div>
<div id="te_352" class="t s2_352">or... what happened? He forgot the name of his own son and remembered Barabbas? Something</div>
<div id="tf_352" class="t s2_352">went wrong.</div>
<div id="tg_352" class="t s2_352">But it was a miracle. Barabbas was not thinking... he was also thinking that Jesus would be saved.</div>
<div id="th_352" class="t s2_352">Jesus was only thirty-three and he had been teaching for only three years, and he had done no</div>
<div id="ti_352" class="t s2_352">harm to anybody; he had committed no crime. Barabbas could not believe when he was released;</div>
<div id="tj_352" class="t s2_352">he looked back again and again thinking, There seems to be some mistake – Barabbas and free?</div>
<div id="tk_352" class="t s2_352">And within three months he committed another murder.</div>
<div id="tl_352" class="t s2_352">It was the tradition that once the emperor had forgiven somebody he could not be given the death</div>
<div id="tm_352" class="t s2_352">penalty again. So now Barabbas was free to murder as many people as he wanted, but he could not</div>
<div id="tn_352" class="t s2_352">be cruciﬁed. For such people they had in Italy a coal mine which was very deep. There was always</div>
<div id="to_352" class="t s2_352">danger and every year people were dying there; so people who could not be cruciﬁed were sent to</div>
<div id="tp_352" class="t s2_352">the coal mine. Barabbas was sent to the coal mine and the second miracle happened. The coal</div>
<div id="tq_352" class="t s2_352">mine collapsed after a few days and everybody – hundreds of people were working inside – died,</div>
<div id="tr_352" class="t s2_352">except Barabbas. He came out alive!</div>
<div id="ts_352" class="t s2_352">This made even the emperor think that Barabbas was in some direct connection with God. This</div>
<div id="tt_352" class="t s2_352">man had been saved twice from death. People started touching him because he was divine, and he</div>
<div id="tu_352" class="t s2_352">was invited for the annual festival in Rome. The emperor wanted to see what would happen one last</div>
<div id="tv_352" class="t s2_352">time. Barabbas was to ﬁght with a hungry lion – and you will be surprised: the miracle happened</div>
<div id="tw_352" class="t s2_352">the third time. He killed the lion barehanded and was declared victorious. Even the emperor had to</div>
<div id="tx_352" class="t s2_352">think that he was no ordinary man and he should be set free again, should be given all the rights of</div>
<div id="ty_352" class="t s2_352">free citizens. He was released, was given all the rights of free citizens, respectability.</div>
<div id="tz_352" class="t s2_352">But all those years Jesus was haunting his mind. He was so innocent and he had been killed... And</div>
<div id="t10_352" class="t s2_352">ﬁnally, listening to Christian missionaries who were underground in basements teaching the gospel,</div>
<div id="t11_352" class="t s2_352">he became a Christian. And the day he became a Christian he was cruciﬁed! God seems to be</div>
<div id="t12_352" class="t s2_352">absolutely against Christians: poor Barabbas was saved three times from death, and the day he</div>
<div id="t13_352" class="t s2_352">became a Christian he was cruciﬁed.</div>
<div id="t14_352" class="t s2_352">But slowly, slowly – this is how the dynamics of mind and life work – Rome started feeling guilty</div>
<div id="t15_352" class="t s2_352">for killing innocent people who were not doing any harm. The ultimate result was that the whole of</div>
<div id="t16_352" class="t s2_352">Rome became Christian. The empire that had killed Jesus died and it became a Christian kingdom.</div>
<div id="t17_352" class="t s2_352">But deep down every Italian is still a pagan.</div>
<div id="t18_352" class="t s2_352">Socrates Poisoned Again After 25 Centuries</div>
<div id="t19_352" class="t s2_352">352</div>
<div id="t1a_352" class="t s3_352">Osho</div>
