<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">around. They have to go to the Himalayan caves; only then they can meditate. That is a </div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">wrong meditation. If meditation is so poor, so impotent that you can't meditate in your </div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">own home, then your meditation is not worth anything. If it needs the Himalayas, then </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">it is not your meditation that is making you silent; it is the silence of the Himalayas. </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">After thirty years of meditating in the Himalayas, you come back to the world, and then </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">all the effort, that whole arduous journey, all those thirty years of work upon yourself, </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">will simply disappear, evaporate. The world will disturb you more than before, because </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">now you have lived outside the world for thirty years. You have become unaccustomed </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">to it, its noise, its people, their ways. This is not right meditation. </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">Right meditation has to become a strength in you, not a weakness. It has to make you </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">stronger -- so strong that you can sit in the marketplace and yet be meditative. </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">And Buddha even uses the word 'right' for samadhi. That has to be understood. He </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">says: "right realization of truth." One wonders, can there be wrong realization of truth? </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">Buddha says yes. Samadhi is the ultimate state when all desires disappear, all thoughts </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">disappear, the whole mind disappears. You are in a state of no-mind. But this can </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">happen in two ways. </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">You can fall into a deep sleep, so deep that there are no longer even dreams -- the mind </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">has disappeared. In deep sleep there is no desire, there is no mind, no thought. But this </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">is not samadhi -- this is coma! </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">And many people -- in India particularly -- go into such a coma, and they think they are </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">in samadhi. For hours together they become unconscious. It is a kind of hysterical fit. </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">You can see their faces, their mouths foaming. You can see the quality of their being. </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">They are just lying down like corpses; they are not radiating. You will not see any joy </div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s1_124">around them, just a negative kind of emptiness. But they are thought to be great saints. </div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">Buddha says this is a wrong kind of meditation and a wrong kind of samadhi. Right </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">samadhi means you have to be without mind, fully awake; in wakefulness, thoughts </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">have to disappear. It is easy to fall asleep, to fall into a deep coma, in a kind of hysterical </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">fit and be without mind; but that is falling below mind not transcending mind. Right </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">samadhi is a transcendence: you go beyond mind, but you are fully alert, aware. Only </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">then is samadhi right -- when it grows in awareness and when awareness grows </div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">through it. When you become enlightened you have to be absolutely awakened; </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">otherwise you missed at the last step. </div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">This way Buddha divides life into eight parts and calls his way "the eightfold way." </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">THE WAY IS EIGHTFOLD. But you have to look at your life, you will have to decide </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">about your life. Don't just follow the words of the Buddha. Follow the SPIRIT of it, </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">because things have changed. In twenty-five centuries it was bound to be so. You are </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">living in a different kind of society, you are living with a different kind of mind. Your </div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">life is no longer the same as it was in Buddha's time. So the essential core will remain </div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">the same, but many things will have to be changed. </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">Remember that you have to be always alert, watchful, balanced; always in the middle, </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">never moving to the extreme, never becoming excessive in anything. But then you have </div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s1_124">to work it out; different people will have to work out different plans for their own life. </div>
