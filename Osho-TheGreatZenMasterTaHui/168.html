<div id="t1_168" class="t s1_168">Just last night we saw how Maitreya did not say anything to Sudhana but just a</div>
<div id="t2_168" class="t s1_168">finger-snap, which was absolutely absurd, unrelated to anything ... but he clicked his fingers</div>
<div id="t3_168" class="t s1_168">and something transpired through that small gesture: Sudhana became enlightened. He was</div>
<div id="t4_168" class="t s1_168">already ready, just standing on the border line, and this simple gesture pushed him.</div>
<div id="t5_168" class="t s1_168">But there are thick skulls! You go on hammering on them, and they think some kind of</div>
<div id="t6_168" class="t s1_168">massage is being ... You go on telling them the most profound truths, and they think it is a</div>
<div id="t7_168" class="t s1_168">great entertainment. Enlightenment to them is nothing but a curiosity. They don't want to</div>
<div id="t8_168" class="t s1_168">become enlightened, but they want to understand -- perhaps sometime it may be a good</div>
<div id="t9_168" class="t s1_168">dimension to explore.</div>
<div id="ta_168" class="t s1_168">One great master from Sri Lanka was dying. He called all his disciples, and his last words</div>
<div id="tb_168" class="t s1_168">were, "You have been listening for almost half a century, but you go on listening,</div>
<div id="tc_168" class="t s1_168">accumulating knowledge, and nothing seems to change in your being. So as a last resort I have</div>
<div id="td_168" class="t s1_168">decided that those who want to become enlightened I will take with me. I am dying; they will</div>
<div id="te_168" class="t s1_168">have to die with me. So if anyone is really interested, stand up!"</div>
<div id="tf_168" class="t s1_168">Thousands of monks ... and they started looking at each other -- "You are senior, you</div>
<div id="tg_168" class="t s1_168">should stand up. You, a great knower, should stand up. You are so learned in scriptures, you</div>
<div id="th_168" class="t s1_168">give such beautiful sermons, now is the time -- get up!" But nobody was getting up.</div>
<div id="ti_168" class="t s1_168">The old man said, "I don't have much time." Then a man raised his hand, but he also did</div>
<div id="tj_168" class="t s1_168">not get up. The old man said, "Just raising the hand won't do. Stand up"</div>
<div id="tk_168" class="t s1_168">The man said, "Forgive me, but I have many other things to do first. I am raising my hand</div>
<div id="tl_168" class="t s1_168">to enquire, because you will be gone and I don't know anybody else who can show me the</div>
<div id="tm_168" class="t s1_168">way. In short, just tell me! If some day my work is finished, my complicated affairs are</div>
<div id="tn_168" class="t s1_168">settled. I may follow but right now ... please forgive me. Don't misunderstand my hand --</div>
<div id="to_168" class="t s1_168">that's why I am not standing, only the hand is standing. I don't want to become enlightened</div>
<div id="tp_168" class="t s1_168">right now, but I would like to know the right path."</div>
<div id="tq_168" class="t s1_168">The old man said, "For half a century I have been talking about the right path, and you</div>
<div id="tr_168" class="t s1_168">have not understood it. How can you understand with in a few minutes? -- because my time</div>
<div id="ts_168" class="t s1_168">has come. But this has given me a great insight that your curiosity, your enquiry, was not for</div>
<div id="tt_168" class="t s1_168">enlightenment. It was a kind of spiritual entertainment."</div>
<div id="tu_168" class="t s1_168">So there are different people ... There are people who are ready; they need just a small</div>
<div id="tv_168" class="t s1_168">help, just the shadow of a whip. And there are people who would not budge from their state of</div>
<div id="tw_168" class="t s1_168">affairs, even if all the buddhas of the past and the present and the future were trying to make</div>
<div id="tx_168" class="t s1_168">them enlightened. Nobody can make you enlightened unless it has become your own</div>
<div id="ty_168" class="t s1_168">innermost longing.</div>
<div id="tz_168" class="t s1_168">Individuals differ, hence Gautam Buddha was always giving instructions to individuals.</div>
<div id="t10_168" class="t s1_168">He was speaking in big assemblies of thousands of monks but he was answering a particular</div>
<div id="t11_168" class="t s1_168">individual and his question. Or he was saying something to a person who was not even aware</div>
<div id="t12_168" class="t s1_168">that it is being said to him. But the person who is ready will catch it immediately, whether he</div>
<div id="t13_168" class="t s1_168">understands that it is especially for him ... It will start working in his being.</div>
<div id="t14_168" class="t s1_168">Because of differences in individuals the teaching cannot be a philosophical system. It</div>
<div id="t15_168" class="t s1_168">cannot be logical non-contradictory. It has to be multi-dimensional. And Ta Hui is right when</div>
<div id="t16_168" class="t s1_168">he says ... HE GUIDED PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL FACULTIES. He</div>
<div id="t17_168" class="t s1_168">is talking about Gautam Buddha. It seems he has come to a little sense. He is no longer calling</div>
<div id="t18_168" class="t s1_168">him the pale face, the old barbarian ...</div>
<div id="t19_168" class="t s1_168">Chapter 13 - Nothingness</div>
<div id="t1a_168" class="t s1_168">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
