<div id="t1_24" class="t s1_24">But from the very beginning every child is taught not to be so cheerful. To be </div>
<div id="t2_24" class="t s1_24">cheerful is to be childish. To be cheerful is to be natural, but not civilized; to be </div>
<div id="t3_24" class="t s1_24">cheerful is somehow primitive, not cultured. So you have been brought up not to </div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s1_24">be cheerful and whatsoever you have ever enjoyed was condemned again and </div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s1_24">again. If you enjoyed just running and shouting around the house, somebody </div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s1_24">was bound to be there saying,"Stop that nonsense! I am reading the newspaper!"-</div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s1_24">as if the newspaper is something very valuable. </div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s1_24">A child shouting and running is a more beautiful sight than any newspaper. And </div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s1_24">the child cannot understand: "Why do I have to stop? Why can't you stop your </div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s1_24">newspaper reading?" The child cannot understand: "What is wrong in my being </div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s1_24">happy and running?" </div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s1_24">"Stop!" -- the whole cheerfulness is suppressed, the child becomes serious. Now </div>
<div id="td_24" class="t s1_24">he sits in a corner unhappy. The energy needs movement: the child is energy, he </div>
<div id="te_24" class="t s1_24">delights in energy. He wants to move shout and scream. He is full of energy he </div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s1_24">wants to overflow, but whatsoever he does is wrong. Either the mother is saying, </div>
<div id="tg_24" class="t s1_24">"Keep quiet," or the father, or the servant, or the brother, or the neighbors. </div>
<div id="th_24" class="t s1_24">Everybody seems to be against his flowing energy. </div>
<div id="ti_24" class="t s1_24">One day it happened: Mulla Nasrudin's wife was very angry. Her small boy was </div>
<div id="tj_24" class="t s1_24">making too much of a nuisance, creating too much nuisance. Finally she was </div>
<div id="tk_24" class="t s1_24">exhausted and she ran after him -- she wanted to thrash him well -- but he </div>
<div id="tl_24" class="t s1_24">escaped, escaped upstairs, and hid himself under a bed. She tried hard, but she </div>
<div id="tm_24" class="t s1_24">couldn't get him out. And she was a very fat woman, she couldn't get </div>
<div id="tn_24" class="t s1_24">underneath, so she said, "Wait, let your father come." </div>
<div id="to_24" class="t s1_24">When Mulla Nasrudin came, she told the whole story. He said, "Don't be </div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s1_24">worried; leave to me. I will go and put him right." </div>
<div id="tq_24" class="t s1_24">So he went upstairs, walked very quietly, looked under the bed and he was </div>
<div id="tr_24" class="t s1_24">surprised -- surprised the way the boy greeted him. The boy said, "Hello, Dad -- </div>
<div id="ts_24" class="t s1_24">is she after you also?!" </div>
<div id="tt_24" class="t s1_24">Everybody is after him. The overflowing energy is looked at as a nuisance. And </div>
<div id="tu_24" class="t s1_24">that is DELIGHT for the child. He doesn't ask much; he simply asks a little </div>
<div id="tv_24" class="t s1_24">freedom to be happy and to be himself. But that is not allowed. </div>
<div id="tw_24" class="t s1_24">"It is time to go to sleep!" When he doesn't feel like going to sleep, it is time. He </div>
<div id="tx_24" class="t s1_24">has to force himself. And how can you force sleep -- have you ever thought about </div>
<div id="ty_24" class="t s1_24">it? Sleep is nothing voluntary, how can you force it? He turns in his bed -- </div>
<div id="tz_24" class="t s1_24">unhappy, miserable -- and cannot think how to bring on sleep. But it is time; it </div>
<div id="t10_24" class="t s1_24">has to be brought or it is against the rules. </div>
<div id="t11_24" class="t s1_24">And then in the morning when he wants to sleep a little longer -- then he has to </div>
<div id="t12_24" class="t s1_24">get up. When he wants to eat something, it is not allowed; when he doesn't want </div>
<div id="t13_24" class="t s1_24">to eat something, it is forced. This goes on and on. By and by the child comes to </div>
<div id="t14_24" class="t s1_24">understand one thing: that whatsoever is cheerful for him has something wrong </div>
<div id="t15_24" class="t s1_24">about it. Whatsoever makes him happy is wrong, and whatsoever makes him sad </div>
<div id="t16_24" class="t s1_24">and serious is right and good and accepted. </div>
