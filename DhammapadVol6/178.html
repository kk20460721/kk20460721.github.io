<div id="t2_178" class="t s1_178">going to be a part of the crowd -- enough is enough. Many children have cried, I don't </div>
<div id="t3_178" class="t s1_178">follow them. I will start my life with laughter." </div>
<div id="t4_178" class="t s1_178">Whether it really happened or not is not the question. In fact it is difficult to laugh </div>
<div id="t5_178" class="t s1_178">immediately after you are born, but the story is significant because it says something </div>
<div id="t6_178" class="t s1_178">about Zarathustra's whole philosophy of life: it is that of great rebellion. </div>
<div id="t7_178" class="t s1_178">Zarathustra is one of the greatest teachers of the world -- he has accepted life in its </div>
<div id="t8_178" class="t s1_178">totality. He is not a renunciate, he is against renunciation. That's why the few </div>
<div id="t9_178" class="t s1_178">Zarathustra followers that have survived had to escape their original motherland, </div>
<div id="ta_178" class="t s1_178">Persia. They had to leave, because Mohammedans were coercing them, converting </div>
<div id="tb_178" class="t s1_178">them; they converted Persia into a Mohammedan country. Persia is now known as Iran. </div>
<div id="tc_178" class="t s1_178">A few people escaped who were not ready to accept this coercive violence. They came </div>
<div id="td_178" class="t s1_178">to India; they live in Bombay and around Bombay -- the Parsis. They are the only </div>
<div id="te_178" class="t s1_178">followers of Zarathustra; they are very life-affirmative people. Hence many Parsis have </div>
<div id="tf_178" class="t s1_178">become interested in me; to them I have a great appeal because I also affirm life. I am </div>
<div id="tg_178" class="t s1_178">not in favor of escaping. </div>
<div id="th_178" class="t s1_178">It is because of Zarathustra's total affirmation of life that Friedrich Nietzsche loved him </div>
<div id="ti_178" class="t s1_178">tremendously and wrote his great book, THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA. He wrote the </div>

<div id="tk_178" class="t s1_178">affirmative as Zarathustra; a man who begins his life with laughter, whose whole life is </div>
<div id="tl_178" class="t s1_178">a laughter. There is no pessimism, not even a strain of pessimism in him. </div>
<div id="tm_178" class="t s1_178">That's exactly the meaning of tathata -- accept the whole of life as it is. In your </div>
<div id="tn_178" class="t s1_178">acceptance you will be preserving your energy, and you have inexhaustible sources of </div>
<div id="to_178" class="t s1_178">energy if you accept. </div>
<div id="tp_178" class="t s1_178">Secondly: when you accept everything, your life becomes cheerful. Nobody can make </div>
<div id="tq_178" class="t s1_178">you miserable, nothing can make you miserable. </div>
<div id="tr_178" class="t s1_178">A man with three hairs on his otherwise bald head came into a hair saloon and asked to </div>
<div id="ts_178" class="t s1_178">get his hair shampooed and braided. The hairdresser got on with his job but just as he </div>
<div id="tt_178" class="t s1_178">was about to finish combing it, one of the hairs fell out. </div>
<div id="tu_178" class="t s1_178">The hairdresser was very embarrassed but the man only said, "Well, what to do? I guess </div>

<div id="tw_178" class="t s1_178">The hairdresser very carefully put one hair to the right side and was about to put the </div>

<div id="ty_178" class="t s1_178">enough but the man took it really cool. </div>
<div id="tz_178" class="t s1_178">"Well," he said, "I guess now I will have to run around with my hair all ruffled up." </div>

<div id="t11_178" class="t s1_178">contented, he always finds a way to be contented. It is a great art. And a man who is </div>
<div id="t12_178" class="t s1_178">always contented and always finds a way to remain contented has the capacity to see </div>
