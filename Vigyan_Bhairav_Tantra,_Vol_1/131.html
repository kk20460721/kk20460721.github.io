<div id="t1_131" class="t s1_131">CHAPTER 9. TECHNIQUES FOR CENTERING</div>
<div id="t2_131" class="t s2_131">No meditation was given to Hui Neng, no scriptures to read, study or meditate upon. Nothing was</div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s2_131">taught to him, he was just thrown into the kitchen. The whole monastery was working. There were</div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s2_131">pundits, scholars, and there were meditators, and there were yogis, and the whole monastery was</div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s2_131">agog. Everyone was working and this Hui Neng was just cleaning rice and doing kitchen work.</div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s2_131">Twelve years passed.</div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s2_131">Hui Neng didn’t go again to the master because it was not allowed.</div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s2_131">He</div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s2_131">waited, he waited, he waited... he simply waited. He was just taken as a servant. Scholars would</div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s2_131">come, meditators would come, and no one would even pay any attention to him. And there were big</div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s2_131">scholars in the monastery.</div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s2_131">Then the master declared that his death was near, and now he wanted to appoint someone to</div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s2_131">function in his place, so he said, ”Those who think they are enlightened should compose a small</div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s2_131">poem of four lines. In those four lines you should put all that you have gained. And if I approve any</div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s2_131">poems and see that the lines show that enlightenment has happened, I will choose someone as my</div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s2_131">successor.”</div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s2_131">There was a great scholar in the monastery, and no one attempted the poem because everyone</div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s2_131">knew that he was going to win. He was a great knower of scriptures, so he composed four lines.</div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s2_131">Those four lines were just like this... the meaning of it was like this: ”Mind is like a mirror, and dust</div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s2_131">gathers on it. Clean the dust, and you are enlightened.”</div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s2_131">But even this great scholar was afraid because the master would know. He already knows who is</div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s2_131">enlightened and who is not. Though all he has written is beautiful, it is the very essence of all the</div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s2_131">scriptures – mind is like a mirror, and dust gathers on it; remove the dust, and you are enlightened</div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s2_131">– this was the whole gist of all the Vedas, but he knew that was all that it was. He had not known</div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s2_131">anything, so he was afraid.</div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s2_131">He didn’t go directly to the master, but in the night he went to the hut, to his master’s hut, and</div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s2_131">wrote all the four lines on the wall without signing – without any signature. In this way, if the master</div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s2_131">approved and said, ”Okay, this is right,” then he would say, ”I have written them.” If he said, ”No! Who</div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s2_131">has written these lines?” then he would keep silent, he thought.</div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s2_131">But the master approved.</div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s2_131">In the morning the master said, ”Okay!” He laughed and said, ”Okay!</div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s2_131">The man who has written this is an enlightened one.” So the whole monastery began to talk about</div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s2_131">it. Everyone knew who had written it. They were discussing and appreciating, and the lines were</div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s2_131">beautiful – really beautiful. Then some monks came to the kitchen. They were drinking tea and they</div>
<div id="tz_131" class="t s2_131">were talking, and Hui Neng was there serving them. He heard what had happened. The moment he</div>
<div id="t10_131" class="t s2_131">heard those four lines, he laughed. So someone asked, ”Why are you laughing, you fool? You do</div>
<div id="t11_131" class="t s2_131">not know anything; for twelve years you have been serving in the kitchen. Why are you laughing?”</div>
<div id="t12_131" class="t s2_131">No one had even heard him laugh before. He was just taken as an idiot who would not even talk.</div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s2_131">So he said, ”I cannot write, and I am not an enlightened one either, but these lines are wrong. So if</div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s2_131">someone comes with me, I will compose four lines. If someone comes with me, he can write it on</div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s2_131">the wall. I cannot write; I do not know writing.”</div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s2_131">So someone followed him – just as a joke. A crowd came there and Hui Neng said, ”Write: There is</div>
<div id="t17_131" class="t s2_131">no mind and there is no mirror, so where can the dust gather? One who knows this is enlightened.”</div>
<div id="t18_131" class="t s2_131">Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t19_131" class="t s2_131">131</div>
<div id="t1a_131" class="t s3_131">Osho</div>
