<div id="t1_34" class="t s1_34">I SHALL ENDURE HARD WORDS</div>
<div id="t2_34" class="t s1_34">....</div>
<div id="t3_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha expects that that is going to be his </div>
<div id="t4_34" class="t s1_34">reward. He will shower you with his love and compassion and all that you can do is </div>
<div id="t5_34" class="t s1_34">insult him, throw hard words or stones at him. All that you can do is some kind of </div>
<div id="t6_34" class="t s1_34">harm. You are going to hurt him. Hence he says in the beginning: I SHALL ENDURE </div>
<div id="t7_34" class="t s1_34">HARD WORDS. He expects that, and every buddha has expected that down the ages. </div>
<div id="t8_34" class="t s1_34">Once a disciple of Buddha was going to preach his word to the masses. He had become </div>
<div id="t9_34" class="t s1_34">enlightened, and Buddha said, "Now you are ready to go, you need not accompany me </div>
<div id="ta_34" class="t s1_34">any longer. Once in a while you can come to see me; otherwise you can help people on </div>
<div id="tb_34" class="t s1_34">your own. Go and help people to become more aware, more meditative." </div>
<div id="tc_34" class="t s1_34">But he said also, "One thing I would like to ask: What part of the country would you </div>
<div id="td_34" class="t s1_34">like to go to?" There was a part of Bihar, where Buddha lived, where no sannyasin of </div>
<div id="te_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha's had ever gone. The name of the part was Suka. This newly enlightened </div>
<div id="tf_34" class="t s1_34">sannyasin said, "I will go to Suka." </div>
<div id="tg_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha said, "Please don't go there. Nobody has gone there yet for a certain reason. The </div>
<div id="th_34" class="t s1_34">people there are very wild, uncultured, stupid, mischievous, murderous, very violent. </div>
<div id="ti_34" class="t s1_34">Don't go there." </div>
<div id="tj_34" class="t s1_34">But the disciple said, "If they are in such a bad situation they need us more than </div>
<div id="tk_34" class="t s1_34">anybody else. The physician is needed only where people are ill." </div>
<div id="tl_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha said, "That I can understand, but before you go, before I bless you to go, I will </div>
<div id="tm_34" class="t s1_34">ask three questions. First: If they insult you, what will be your response?" </div>
<div id="tn_34" class="t s1_34">The young man said, "I will thank them, I will feel grateful that they are only insulting </div>
<div id="to_34" class="t s1_34">me. They could have beaten me. They are good people. They are not beating me; they </div>
<div id="tp_34" class="t s1_34">are simply insulting me -- and what can words do? Words are words, they can't hurt </div>
<div id="tq_34" class="t s1_34">me." </div>
<div id="tr_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha said, "The second question: If they beat you, what will be your response?" </div>
<div id="ts_34" class="t s1_34">The young man said, "I will thank them, I will feel grateful that they are beating me. </div>
<div id="tt_34" class="t s1_34">They could have killed me. They are only beating me -- they are so compassionate, so </div>
<div id="tu_34" class="t s1_34">kind. It would have been so easy for them to kill me." </div>
<div id="tv_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha said, "Now, the last question. If they kill you, dying, in the last moments, what </div>
<div id="tw_34" class="t s1_34">will be your response?" </div>
<div id="tx_34" class="t s1_34">The young man said, "Still I will be grateful and thankful to them because they are </div>
<div id="ty_34" class="t s1_34">taking a life away from me in which I may have done something wrong. If I had lived </div>
<div id="tz_34" class="t s1_34">more I may have committed some crime, some sin; I may have fallen from my peak of </div>
<div id="t10_34" class="t s1_34">awareness. They are simply taking that life which is useless to me. I have attained the </div>
<div id="t11_34" class="t s1_34">treasure, I don't need life anymore. They are taking something useless away from me </div>
<div id="t12_34" class="t s1_34">and I will be grateful because, who knows, if I had lived more, in some situation I may </div>
<div id="t13_34" class="t s1_34">have gone astray." </div>
<div id="t14_34" class="t s1_34">Buddha said, "Now you can go anywhere you like with my blessings. You have not </div>
<div id="t15_34" class="t s1_34">only become enlightened, you have become capable of being a master." </div>
