<div id="t1_42" class="t s1_42">CHAPTER 3. FLIGHT FROM THE SHADOW</div>
<div id="t2_42" class="t s2_42">Where are you going, so fast? Man and man’s mind have always been mad about speed, as if we</div>
<div id="t3_42" class="t s2_42">are going somewhere and speed is needed. So we go on becoming more and more speedy. Where</div>
<div id="t4_42" class="t s2_42">are you going?</div>
<div id="t5_42" class="t s2_42">Finally, whether you go slow or fast, you reach death.</div>
<div id="t6_42" class="t s2_42">There is a Suﬁ story. A King dreamed that his death was coming. He saw a shadow standing in the</div>
<div id="t7_42" class="t s2_42">dream so he asked: Who are you? The shadow said: I am your death and tomorrow, by the time</div>
<div id="t8_42" class="t s2_42">the sun sets, I will be coming to you. The King wanted to ask if there was any way to escape, but</div>
<div id="t9_42" class="t s2_42">he couldn’t because he became so afraid that the dream was broken, and the shadow disappeared.</div>
<div id="ta_42" class="t s2_42">He was perspiring and trembling.</div>
<div id="tb_42" class="t s2_42">In the middle of the night he called all his wise men and said: Find out the meaning of this dream.</div>
<div id="tc_42" class="t s2_42">And as you know, you cannot ﬁnd more foolish people than wise men. They ran to their houses and</div>
<div id="td_42" class="t s2_42">brought their scriptures. They were big, big volumes. And they started to consult and debate and</div>
<div id="te_42" class="t s2_42">discuss and ﬁght with each other and argue.</div>
<div id="tf_42" class="t s2_42">Listening to their talk the King became more and more confused. They were not agreeing on any</div>
<div id="tg_42" class="t s2_42">point; they belonged to different sects, as wise men always do. They don’t belong to themselves,</div>
<div id="th_42" class="t s2_42">they belong to some dead tradition. One was a Hindu, another was a Mohammedan, another was a</div>
<div id="ti_42" class="t s2_42">Christian. They had brought their scriptures with them and they tried and tried. And as they got into</div>
<div id="tj_42" class="t s2_42">discussion they became mad, and argued over and over again. The King was very much disturbed</div>
<div id="tk_42" class="t s2_42">because the sun was rising, and when the sun rises, it is not long until the sun will set, because</div>
<div id="tl_42" class="t s2_42">rising is really setting, it has already started. The journey has started and within twelve hours the</div>
<div id="tm_42" class="t s2_42">sun will set.</div>
<div id="tn_42" class="t s2_42">He tried to interrupt them, but they said: Don’t interrupt, this is a serious question. Then one old</div>
<div id="to_42" class="t s2_42">man, who had served the King for his whole life, came near and whispered in his ear: It is better</div>
<div id="tp_42" class="t s2_42">that you escape, because these people will never come to any conclusion. Wise men have never</div>
<div id="tq_42" class="t s2_42">reached any conclusion. They will discuss and debate, and their death will come, but the conclusion</div>
<div id="tr_42" class="t s2_42">will not come My suggestion is that when death has warned you, it is better that you escape from</div>
<div id="ts_42" class="t s2_42">this palace at least! Go anywhere! And go fast! This advice appealed, it was absolutely right. When</div>
<div id="tt_42" class="t s2_42">man cannot do anything, he thinks of ﬂight, escape.</div>
<div id="tu_42" class="t s2_42">The King had a very fast horse, he got onto it and escaped. He had told the wise men: If I come</div>
<div id="tv_42" class="t s2_42">back alive and you have decided, tell me – but right now, I am going. He was very happy, and faster</div>
<div id="tw_42" class="t s2_42">and faster he went, because it was a life and death problem.</div>
<div id="tx_42" class="t s2_42">Again and again he looked back to see if the shadow was coming, but there was no shadow. He</div>
<div id="ty_42" class="t s2_42">was happy, death was not there, and he was escaping. By the time the sun was setting, he was</div>
<div id="tz_42" class="t s2_42">hundreds and hundreds of miles away from the capital. Under a big Banyan tree he stopped, got</div>
<div id="t10_42" class="t s2_42">down from his horse, thanked it and said: It is you, you who have saved me. Suddenly, as he was</div>
<div id="t11_42" class="t s2_42">talking to and thanking the horse, he felt the same hand that he had felt in the dream. He looked</div>
<div id="t12_42" class="t s2_42">back. The same shadow was there, and Death said: I would also like to thank your horse, he is</div>
<div id="t13_42" class="t s2_42">really fast. I have been waiting under this Banyan tree all day and I was worried whether you would</div>
<div id="t14_42" class="t s2_42">be able to reach it or not The distance was so great, but this horse is really something. You have</div>
<div id="t15_42" class="t s2_42">arrived at exactly the moment you were needed here.</div>
<div id="t16_42" class="t s2_42">When the Shoe Fits</div>
<div id="t17_42" class="t s2_42">42</div>
<div id="t18_42" class="t s3_42">Osho</div>
