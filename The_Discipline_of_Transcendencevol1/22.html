<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">of them... you are not alone. </div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">To be alone is really the greatest miracle. That means now you don't belong to </div>

<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">you are simply happy by being yourself. You don't need anything, your bliss is </div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">unconditional. Yes, it is the greatest miracle in the world. </div>

<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">you. It is a response, a natural response. The first lesson of love is to learn how to </div>
<div id="t15_22" class="t s1_22">be alone. </div>
<div id="t16_22" class="t s1_22">It is a very significant statement. It has nothing like a parable in it. It is </div>
