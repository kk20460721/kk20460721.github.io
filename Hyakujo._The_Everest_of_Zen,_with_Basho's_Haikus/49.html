<div id="t1_49" class="t s1_49">CHAPTER 3. IN SEARCH OF A LOST TREASURE</div>
<div id="t2_49" class="t s2_49">he was completely trained for it. Even books were written in his name by Leadbeater. A great book,</div>
<div id="t3_49" class="t s2_49">AT THE FEET OF THE MASTER, is supposed to have been written by him when he was thirteen</div>
<div id="t4_49" class="t s2_49">years of age – and he himself does not remember! Later on when asked, ”Have you written this</div>
<div id="t5_49" class="t s2_49">book?” He said, ”I don’t remember.” The reality is, he never wrote that book. That book – and I have</div>
<div id="t6_49" class="t s2_49">looked deeply into Leadbeater’s other books – is in the same style. It is the same man, Leadbeater,</div>
<div id="t7_49" class="t s2_49">who has written that book in the name of J. Krishnamurti. It is to prove to the world that it is not an</div>
<div id="t8_49" class="t s2_49">ordinary human being, but a divine incarnation – that at the age of thirteen he was writing such a</div>
<div id="t9_49" class="t s2_49">great book.</div>
<div id="ta_49" class="t s2_49">The book is certainly great, and Leadbeater was a very articulate writer and well-studied man. He</div>
<div id="tb_49" class="t s2_49">chose J. Krishnamurti and his brother Nityananda just when Krishnamurti was nine years old.</div>
<div id="tc_49" class="t s2_49">Those two boys were playing in the river, near Adyar in Madras, where the headquarters of the</div>
<div id="td_49" class="t s2_49">Theosophical Movement was. Leadbeater saw those two boys swimming and enjoying in the river,</div>
<div id="te_49" class="t s2_49">throwing water at each other.</div>
<div id="tf_49" class="t s2_49">And he was certainly a very perceptive man – he could see that</div>
<div id="tg_49" class="t s2_49">something great was possible with these two boys. He found three other boys. They all became</div>
<div id="th_49" class="t s2_49">great in their own ﬁelds.</div>
<div id="ti_49" class="t s2_49">Nityananda died because of too much discipline. He was a very fragile person. They had to wake up</div>
<div id="tj_49" class="t s2_49">at three o’clock, to go through all kinds of rituals, to listen to scriptures, to eat only certain things...</div>
<div id="tk_49" class="t s2_49">One of the great difﬁculties with Leadbeater was, he was a homosexual. And he abused every child,</div>
<div id="tl_49" class="t s2_49">including J. Krishnamurti. There was a case against Leadbeater in Madras High Court. When the</div>
<div id="tm_49" class="t s2_49">father of these two children – he was a poor man, a poor clerk whose wife had died and so he was</div>
<div id="tn_49" class="t s2_49">in trouble about how to manage these two boys and his ofﬁce... So when Leadbeater proposed the</div>
<div id="to_49" class="t s2_49">idea that Annie Besant could adopt them, the father was very happy. Annie Besant was a world-</div>
<div id="tp_49" class="t s2_49">famous woman.</div>
<div id="tq_49" class="t s2_49">He gave the adoption to Annie Besant, but it was discovered by many people that those small</div>
<div id="tr_49" class="t s2_49">children had been sexually abused by Leadbeater. So the man appealed to the high court: ”I want</div>
<div id="ts_49" class="t s2_49">my children to be returned me. They are being homosexually abused by Leadbeater.”</div>
<div id="tt_49" class="t s2_49">To avoid the situation, the judge was ready to return the children because there were witnesses</div>
<div id="tu_49" class="t s2_49">of this abuse. Annie Besant, being a very famous British woman, managed to smuggle all those</div>
<div id="tv_49" class="t s2_49">children to England before the court orders were passed. This was easy for her because India was</div>
<div id="tw_49" class="t s2_49">under British rule, and Annie Besant was a powerful woman. So she managed to take the children</div>
<div id="tx_49" class="t s2_49">out of the country.</div>
<div id="ty_49" class="t s2_49">Then when the magistrate’s orders were issued, saying that the children should be returned, the</div>
<div id="tz_49" class="t s2_49">children were not there.</div>
<div id="t10_49" class="t s2_49">She did not put those children, J. Krishnamurti included, into any state school.</div>
<div id="t11_49" class="t s2_49">This was such</div>
<div id="t12_49" class="t s2_49">a guarded phenomenon – in a public school he may have started smoking, he may have started</div>
<div id="t13_49" class="t s2_49">behaving like ordinary students. He was kept almost a prisoner. Private tutors were teaching him,</div>
<div id="t14_49" class="t s2_49">and all kinds of nonsense – religious, scriptural – was forced upon him.</div>
<div id="t15_49" class="t s2_49">All this created a situation in which he revolted.</div>
<div id="t16_49" class="t s2_49">Hyakujo: The Everest of Zen, with Basho’s Haikus</div>
<div id="t17_49" class="t s2_49">49</div>
<div id="t18_49" class="t s3_49">Osho</div>
