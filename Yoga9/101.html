<div id="t2_101" class="t s1_101">both. </div>
<div id="t3_101" class="t s1_101">A man had a reputation as a road hog. He was lying in a hospital bed after an accident. </div>
<div id="t4_101" class="t s1_101">The doctor asked the nurse, "How is he this morning?" </div>
<div id="t5_101" class="t s1_101">She said, "Oh, he keeps putting his right hand out." </div>

<div id="t9_101" class="t s1_101">The primitive societies live in the psychological time. The East has lived in the </div>
<div id="ta_101" class="t s1_101">psychological time; the West lives in the chronological time. If you move farther into the </div>
<div id="tb_101" class="t s1_101">primitive societies hidden behind the hills and the forests, deep, you will see they live </div>
<div id="tc_101" class="t s1_101">absolutely in psychological time. There are a few primitive societies in which dream is </div>
<div id="td_101" class="t s1_101">more important than reality, and the first thing a child has to do before breakfast is to </div>
<div id="te_101" class="t s1_101">relate his dream to his elders. The first thing is psychoanalysis. The dream has to be </div>
<div id="tf_101" class="t s1_101">related to the elders before breakfast, and they all gather together and they analyze the </div>
<div id="tg_101" class="t s1_101">dream. And then they tell the child to do something, because the dream is symbolic and it </div>
<div id="th_101" class="t s1_101">shows that something is needed to be done. </div>
<div id="ti_101" class="t s1_101">For example, a child dreams that he has been fighting with a friend, and in the morning </div>
<div id="tj_101" class="t s1_101">he tells the dream to his elders. They will interpret it, and they will send the child with </div>

<div id="tn_101" class="t s1_101">you have simply dreamt, but that particular primitive society says that you dreamt it </div>
<div id="to_101" class="t s1_101">because you wanted to do something like that, otherwise why? It must be a desire, </div>
<div id="tp_101" class="t s1_101">hidden, repressed. As far as mind is concerned, you have committed it. Go and tell the </div>

<div id="tx_101" class="t s1_101">The young girl went to see her psychiatrist and he asked her what she had dreamt on the </div>

<div id="t12_101" class="t s1_101">somebody else do it? Because psychological time is personal, nobody can understand </div>
<div id="t13_101" class="t s1_101">more than you yourself. Your dreams, how can somebody else understand them? His </div>
<div id="t14_101" class="t s1_101">interpretations are going to be falsifications. His interpretations are going to be his </div>
