<div id="t1_81" class="t s1_81">forms: of man, animals, birds, gods, angels. And they had become tremendously </div>
<div id="t2_81" class="t s1_81">efficient in it. All over Tibet they were known as 'the expert twisters'. And by and </div>
<div id="t3_81" class="t s1_81">by they also became very rich, because their goods were sold all over the </div>
<div id="t4_81" class="t s1_81">country. Their goods had even started to be sold in India and China, and beyond </div>
<div id="t5_81" class="t s1_81">the borders. </div>
<div id="t6_81" class="t s1_81">The village became very very rich and affluent. And as it happens always: </div>
<div id="t7_81" class="t s1_81">whenever a society, a village, a family, a man, becomes very affluent, the </div>
<div id="t8_81" class="t s1_81">awareness dawns that this whole success has been a failure. Because riches are </div>
<div id="t9_81" class="t s1_81">there, but the poverty is not destroyed by them. In fact, only a rich man knows </div>
<div id="ta_81" class="t s1_81">how poor he is. A poor man is never so poor; he cannot compare, he has nothing </div>
<div id="tb_81" class="t s1_81">to compare his poverty against. And a poor man is never hopeless; he goes on </div>
<div id="tc_81" class="t s1_81">hoping. Some day or other, he will attain to happiness, he will attain to riches </div>
<div id="td_81" class="t s1_81">and success. But a rich man a man who has succeeded -- fails utterly, because </div>
<div id="te_81" class="t s1_81">suddenly he becomes hopeless; now there is no hope. Whatsoever could be </div>
<div id="tf_81" class="t s1_81">attained, he has attained -- and nothing has been attained. For the first time, the </div>
<div id="tg_81" class="t s1_81">inner poverty erupts into consciousness. </div>
<div id="th_81" class="t s1_81">In that village it happened -- as it is happening in America today -- in that village </div>
<div id="ti_81" class="t s1_81">it happened: people had become affluent, very rich. Their goods were sold all </div>
<div id="tj_81" class="t s1_81">over Asia. And by and by they became aware that this whole life seemed to be </div>
<div id="tk_81" class="t s1_81">pointless... just continuously twisting wires, metals, and bringing more and more </div>
<div id="tl_81" class="t s1_81">money into the homes. But for what? There seemed to be no meaning in it. </div>
<div id="tm_81" class="t s1_81">So they decided to invite a sage who used to live in the hills, to tell them the </div>
<div id="tn_81" class="t s1_81">secret of life. Because all that this world could give, they had, but everything </div>
<div id="to_81" class="t s1_81">seemed to be pointless. </div>
<div id="tp_81" class="t s1_81">The sage came. Before he even uttered a single sentence, he knew what was </div>
<div id="tq_81" class="t s1_81">going to happen. But still he spoke. He said, "Unless you die, you will not attain </div>
<div id="tr_81" class="t s1_81">to the meaning you are asking for. Unless you lose yourself, you will not gain </div>
<div id="ts_81" class="t s1_81">yourself." He talked about surrender, egolessness. </div>
<div id="tt_81" class="t s1_81">One man stood up and he said, "Wait. This is impossible. I am; how can I </div>
<div id="tu_81" class="t s1_81">surrender my am-ness? Who will surrender it? It is impossible. You are talking </div>
<div id="tv_81" class="t s1_81">nonsense." </div>
<div id="tw_81" class="t s1_81">Another man said, "If I lose myself, what is the guarantee that I will gain my self </div>
<div id="tx_81" class="t s1_81">about which you are talking?" </div>
<div id="ty_81" class="t s1_81">Another said, "You are just talking absurdities. We have asked you to come to </div>
<div id="tz_81" class="t s1_81">teach us life, and you are teaching death. What you are saying to us means: </div>
<div id="t10_81" class="t s1_81">should we commit suicide?" </div>
<div id="t11_81" class="t s1_81">The sage laughed and he said, "I knew beforehand what was going to happen. I </div>
<div id="t12_81" class="t s1_81">know your disease. For centuries, and for generations and generations, you have </div>
<div id="t13_81" class="t s1_81">been twisting wires and metals; you have become expert twisters. So I knew it </div>
<div id="t14_81" class="t s1_81">beforehand: whatsoever I would say, you would immediately twist it." </div>
<div id="t15_81" class="t s1_81">It seems that from that village, one man has come here. </div>
<div id="t16_81" class="t s1_81">Now I will read the two questions. He has asked many, but there is no need of </div>
<div id="t17_81" class="t s1_81">them -- two will give you the vision of how things can be twisted. </div>
