<div id="t1_350" class="t s1_350">Many other masters said to Chou, "This is too much! You can hit ... but at least listen to</div>
<div id="t2_350" class="t s1_350">his answer."</div>
<div id="t3_350" class="t s1_350">But Chou used to say, "Even to listen to their answers is to give an indication that there</div>
<div id="t4_350" class="t s1_350">can be a right answer. I want to make it absolutely clear to them that all answers are wrong.</div>
<div id="t5_350" class="t s1_350">By hitting them again and again, one day it dawns on the disciple that perhaps no answer is</div>
<div id="t6_350" class="t s1_350">right, perhaps there is no answer at all ... and then he will not come, because now what is the</div>
<div id="t7_350" class="t s1_350">point? Then he will sit under the tree in the garden of the master, enjoying."</div>
<div id="t8_350" class="t s1_350">And when the master sees that a certain disciple has not come for many days -- the disciple</div>
<div id="t9_350" class="t s1_350">had to report every day what is his finding for those twenty-four hours -- then Chou would go</div>
<div id="ta_350" class="t s1_350">to look for the disciple and would find him giggling under a tree. He would sit with the</div>
<div id="tb_350" class="t s1_350">disciple and giggle, and he would say, "So you have found it!"</div>
<div id="tc_350" class="t s1_350">This is the man who said once ... He gave to a disciple a famous koan: "What is the sound</div>
<div id="td_350" class="t s1_350">of one hand clapping?" And the disciple, rather than going out, took the stick of the master</div>
<div id="te_350" class="t s1_350">and hit him hard. This was the situation in which Chou said to him, "AN OBVIOUS CASE. I</div>
<div id="tf_350" class="t s1_350">FORGIVE YOU THIRTY BLOWS" -- otherwise, if you had gone and meditated, you would</div>
<div id="tg_350" class="t s1_350">have got thirty blows. You did the right thing. I was asking you something absurd.</div>
<div id="th_350" class="t s1_350">But what is the point of asking the absurd? The point is that mind comes to a stop only</div>
<div id="ti_350" class="t s1_350">when it faces the absurd; if it can solve the problem it goes on functioning. When it cannot</div>
<div id="tj_350" class="t s1_350">solve it this way or that way, it tries hard all the doors and everything is closed, a realization</div>
<div id="tk_350" class="t s1_350">arises that there is no way out -- mind stops.</div>
<div id="tl_350" class="t s1_350">In that very stopping is the answer. In that very stopping is the silence, the</div>
<div id="tm_350" class="t s1_350">transcendence ... the peace that passeth understanding.</div>
<div id="tn_350" class="t s1_350">Wu Ye, another master, told questioners, "NO FALSE THINKING!" That was his only</div>
<div id="to_350" class="t s1_350">teaching. He was asked by the emperor to come to the court to deliver a sermon on some</div>
<div id="tp_350" class="t s1_350">auspicious occasion. He came with his thousands of disciples. There was great silence. All the</div>
<div id="tq_350" class="t s1_350">warriors and the samurais and the courtiers and the queens and the princes and all the rich</div>
<div id="tr_350" class="t s1_350">people of the capital were invited. Wu Ye stepped up onto the platform, looked all around and</div>
<div id="ts_350" class="t s1_350">said, "NO FALSE THINKING! The sermon is over" -- and he stepped down.</div>
<div id="tt_350" class="t s1_350">The emperor looked ... the whole court was shocked: "What kind of sermon is this?" But</div>
<div id="tu_350" class="t s1_350">Wu Ye's disciples had a great laugh, because they knew this was going to be the sermon. This</div>
<div id="tv_350" class="t s1_350">was the only sermon they had been hearing every day. Every day, without fail, with great</div>
<div id="tw_350" class="t s1_350">seriousness Wu Ye comes and says, "NO FALSE THINKING!"</div>
<div id="tx_350" class="t s1_350">He was a simple man. In fact, he has condensed the whole philosophy of Buddha into a</div>
<div id="ty_350" class="t s1_350">simple statement: NO FALSE THINKING. And if you start looking into the matter, all</div>
<div id="tz_350" class="t s1_350">thinking is false. No false thinking means no thinking; no false thinking means falling into a</div>
<div id="t10_350" class="t s1_350">deep silence, becoming a no-mind.</div>
<div id="t11_350" class="t s1_350">His disciples slowly, slowly had understood, because they were meditating. But every day</div>
<div id="t12_350" class="t s1_350">the sermon was there -- and with great seriousness he used to come. Even his old disciples</div>
<div id="t13_350" class="t s1_350">sometimes were expecting that perhaps today he is going to say something else. But in his</div>
<div id="t14_350" class="t s1_350">whole life, as far as I know -- he was the only consistent man -- he never said anything else.</div>
<div id="t15_350" class="t s1_350">Another master Ta Hui mentions is Lu Tsu. Whenever Lu Tsu saw a monk enter the gate,</div>
<div id="t16_350" class="t s1_350">he would immediately turn around and sit facing the wall. Strange behavior! -- somebody</div>
<div id="t17_350" class="t s1_350">comes to you and the moment he enters in the door, you immediately turn around and start</div>
<div id="t18_350" class="t s1_350">looking at the wall!</div>
<div id="t19_350" class="t s1_350">Chapter 30 - Be thorough going</div>
<div id="t1a_350" class="t s1_350">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
