<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">welcome, but he will not call you forth, he will not seek and search for you. </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">Buddha says: Mostly it happens that fifty percent of the enlightened ones are arhatas </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">and fifty percent are bodhisattvas. That's how nature keeps its balance on every plane. </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">So don't be worried if you feel one day that you have arrived, but there is no desire to </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">help anybody; then don't force it. Forcing it will be ugly, will be violent, will be </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">destructive. If it is not there it is not there. Then God is happy with you as you are. </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">But if you feel that there is a desire arising in you to help, to be compassionate, to hold </div>

<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">worried about the troubles. The troubles ARE there, but the world needs some people </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">who can show the way, and only those who know can show the way. Even for them it is </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">difficult. And the world is in immense need because it is being led by stupid people. It </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">is being guided by politicians and priests, all kinds of people who don't know what </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">they are doing. That's why it is always in such chaos. </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">Mulla Nasruddin's son came home late from school. The Mulla grabbed him and gave </div>

<div id="tr_9" class="t s1_9">are teaching and who are bringing up new children -- to create more chaos in the world. </div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s1_9">Yes, bodhisattvas are needed, but their path is far more arduous than the path of the </div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">arhatas. The mystic enjoys his bliss. He is like a beautiful roseflower, fragrant, dancing </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">in the wind, in the sun, in the rain, but unconcerned about anything else. The </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">bodhisattva takes the burden of others on his shoulders. He tries to help people who are </div>
