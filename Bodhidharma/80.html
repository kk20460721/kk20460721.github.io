<div id="t1_80" class="t s1_80">In the UPANISHADS there is an ancient story that I have always loved. A great </div>
<div id="t2_80" class="t s1_80">king named Yayati became one hundred years old. Now it was enough; he had </div>
<div id="t3_80" class="t s1_80">lived tremendously. He had enjoyed all that life could make available. He was </div>
<div id="t4_80" class="t s1_80">one of the greatest kings of his time. But the story is beautiful </div>
<div id="t5_80" class="t s1_80">....</div>
<div id="t6_80" class="t s1_80">Death came and said to Yayati, "Get ready. It is time for you, and I have come to </div>
<div id="t7_80" class="t s1_80">take you." Yayati saw Death, and he was a great warrior and he had won many </div>
<div id="t8_80" class="t s1_80">wars. Yayati started trembling, and said, "But it is too early." Death said, "Too </div>
<div id="t9_80" class="t s1_80">early! You have been alive for one hundred years. Even your children have </div>
<div id="ta_80" class="t s1_80">become old. Your eldest son is eighty years old. What more do you want?" </div>
<div id="tb_80" class="t s1_80">Yayati had one hundred sons because he had one hundred wives. He asked </div>
<div id="tc_80" class="t s1_80">Death, "Can you do a favor for me? I know you have to take someone. If I can </div>
<div id="td_80" class="t s1_80">persuade one of my sons, can you leave me for one hundred years more and take </div>
<div id="te_80" class="t s1_80">one of my sons?" Death said, "That is perfectly okay if somebody else is ready to </div>
<div id="tf_80" class="t s1_80">go. But I don't think </div>
<div id="tg_80" class="t s1_80">....</div>
<div id="th_80" class="t s1_80">If you are not ready, and you are the father and you have </div>
<div id="ti_80" class="t s1_80">lived more and you have enjoyed everything, why should your son be ready?" </div>
<div id="tj_80" class="t s1_80">Yayati called his one hundred sons. The older sons remained silent. There was </div>
<div id="tk_80" class="t s1_80">great silence, nobody was saying anything. Only one, the youngest son who was </div>
<div id="tl_80" class="t s1_80">only sixteen years of age, stood up and he said, "I am ready." Even Death felt </div>
<div id="tm_80" class="t s1_80">sorry for the boy and said to the young man, "Perhaps you are too innocent. </div>
<div id="tn_80" class="t s1_80">Can't you see your ninety-nine brothers are absolutely silent? Someone is eighty, </div>
<div id="to_80" class="t s1_80">someone is seventy-five, someone is seventy-eight, someone is seventy, someone </div>
<div id="tp_80" class="t s1_80">is sixty -- they have lived -- but they still want to live. And you have not lived at </div>
<div id="tq_80" class="t s1_80">all. Even I feel sad to take you. You think again." </div>
<div id="tr_80" class="t s1_80">The boy said, "No, just seeing the situation makes me completely certain. Don't </div>
<div id="ts_80" class="t s1_80">feel sad or sorry; I am going with absolute awareness. I can see that if my father </div>
<div id="tt_80" class="t s1_80">is not satisfied in one hundred years, what is the point of being here? How can I </div>
<div id="tu_80" class="t s1_80">be satisfied? I am seeing my ninety-nine brothers; nobody is satisfied. So why </div>
<div id="tv_80" class="t s1_80">waste time? At least I can do this favor to my father. In his old age, let him enjoy </div>
<div id="tw_80" class="t s1_80">one hundred years more. But I am finished. Seeing the situation that nobody is </div>
<div id="tx_80" class="t s1_80">satisfied, I can understand one thing completely -- that even if I live one hundred </div>
<div id="ty_80" class="t s1_80">years, I will not be satisfied either. So it doesn't matter whether I go today or </div>
<div id="tz_80" class="t s1_80">after ninety years. You just take me." </div>
<div id="t10_80" class="t s1_80">Death took the boy. And after one hundred years he came back. And Yayati was </div>
<div id="t11_80" class="t s1_80">in the same position. And he said, "These hundred years passed so soon. All my </div>
<div id="t12_80" class="t s1_80">old sons have died, but I have another regiment. I can give you some son. Just </div>
<div id="t13_80" class="t s1_80">have mercy on me." </div>
<div id="t14_80" class="t s1_80">It went on -- the story goes on to say -- for one thousand years. Ten times Death </div>
<div id="t15_80" class="t s1_80">came. And nine times he took some son and Yayati lived one hundred years </div>
<div id="t16_80" class="t s1_80">more. The tenth time Yayati said, "Although I am still as unsatisfied as I was </div>
<div id="t17_80" class="t s1_80">when you came for the first time, now -- although unwillingly, reluctantly -- I </div>
<div id="t18_80" class="t s1_80">will go, because I cannot go on asking for favors. It is too much. And one thing </div>
<div id="t19_80" class="t s1_80">has become certain to me, that if one thousand years cannot help me to be </div>
<div id="t1a_80" class="t s1_80">contented, then even ten thousand will not do." </div>
