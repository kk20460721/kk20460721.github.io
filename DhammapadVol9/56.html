<div id="t1_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus came to a village. He saw a man lying in the gutter, shouting, talking incoherently, </div>
<div id="t2_56" class="t s1_56">making noise. It was difficult to understand what he wanted to say; he was completely </div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s1_56">drunk. </div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus came close just to understand what he wanted to say -- maybe he needed some </div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s1_56">help. When he came close he recognized the face. He shook the man. The man opened </div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s1_56">his eyes, and Jesus said, "Don't you recognize me? I recognize you." </div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s1_56">The man said, "I also recognize you, but please leave me alone." </div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus said, "As far as I remember you were ill, very ill, almost on the verge of death, and </div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s1_56">I cured you. I have done a miracle -- and I don't see any gratitude in your eyes." </div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s1_56">The man said, "Gratitude? I was going to die and that would have been a rest from this </div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s1_56">ugly life. You made me healthy again and now I am suffering again. Who is </div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s1_56">responsible? Why did you make me healthy again? Who gave you the right?" </div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus was shocked -- he had never thought about it. Jesus said, "But you are healthy -- </div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s1_56">you can USE your health." </div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s1_56">And the man said, "That's what I am doing. When one is healthy one drinks, eats, </div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s1_56">enjoys the things of life. What else can I do with my health?" </div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s1_56">It is really a very pertinent question: What will you do with your health? Eat, drink, be </div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s1_56">merry! And the man seems to be almost angry at Jesus. </div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus walked away very puzzled, and he saw another man who was running after a </div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s1_56">prostitute. He stopped the man and said, "Young man, I know you perfectly well. You </div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s1_56">were blind and I gave you eyes." </div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s1_56">And the man said, "What else should I do with the eyes? The eyes are meant to look and </div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s1_56">search for beauty. And that woman -- have you not seen how beautiful she is? Leave me </div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s1_56">alone! I have no more time for you." </div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s1_56">Jesus was very sad because he was thinking he had helped these people. He came out of </div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s1_56">the village and a man was preparing to kill himself. He asked the man, "Life is so </div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s1_56">valuable! Why are you killing yourself?" </div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s1_56">The man looked at Jesus and he said, "Don't you recognize me? I had died and you are </div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s1_56">the man who disturbed my death and you brought me back from my death. It is too </div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s1_56">much! I cannot bear this life any longer. Enough is enough! And please, you have come </div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s1_56">again... and I have made every preparation to kill myself. Don't do your miracle again -- </div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s1_56">I don't want any of your miracles!" </div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s1_56">This is a strange story, but of great significance. Man is such, so blind, that he will do </div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s1_56">something wrong if he is healthy, he will do something wrong if he is alive, he will do </div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s1_56">something wrong if he has eyes -- he will see something wrong. Unless you are </div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s1_56">conscious you are going to do wrong. </div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s1_56">That's why in the East, Buddha, Mahavira, Lao Tzu and people like them have never </div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s1_56">done any miracles -- or they have done only one miracle, and that miracle is the </div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s1_56">transformation of unconsciousness into consciousness -- because unless that happens </div>
<div id="t14_56" class="t s1_56">everything is going to be wrong. It is giving a sword into a child's hand: either he will </div>
<div id="t15_56" class="t s1_56">cut himself or somebody else. You don't give poison to a child to play with; it is </div>
<div id="t16_56" class="t s1_56">dangerous. Man is unconscious, almost in a state of drunkenness. </div>
