<div id="t2_105" class="t s1_105">SEEKING WEALTH, HE DESTROYS HIMSELF. </div>
<div id="t3_105" class="t s1_105">THE FOOL IS HIS OWN ENEMY... for many reasons. First: he will die without being </div>
<div id="t4_105" class="t s1_105">born. He will die as a seed. He will never bloom, he will never come to flowers and to </div>
<div id="t5_105" class="t s1_105">fruits. He will never know what fulfillment is. His life will be a sheer wastage. His life </div>
<div id="t6_105" class="t s1_105">will be a desert without any oasis. He will not know any blessing, any benediction, any </div>
<div id="t7_105" class="t s1_105">ecstasy -- which was his birthright. He will be self-destructive. Not to grow into </div>
<div id="t8_105" class="t s1_105">consciousness is the most suicidal act one can commit; hence Buddha says: THE FOOL </div>
<div id="t9_105" class="t s1_105">IS HIS OWN ENEMY. He misses a great opportunity. </div>
<div id="ta_105" class="t s1_105">Life is such a precious opportunity to know, to be, but the fool misses. He will not even </div>
<div id="tb_105" class="t s1_105">be aware what he has missed. He will pass through life like a zombie. His whole life is </div>
<div id="tc_105" class="t s1_105">mechanical. He gets up early in the morning, takes his breakfast, goes to the office, does </div>
<div id="td_105" class="t s1_105">his work, drives back home... and he is doing everything, but still he is a robot. He is </div>
<div id="te_105" class="t s1_105">not yet inwardly full of light; deep inside him there is only darkness. He is doing all </div>
<div id="tf_105" class="t s1_105">these things because he has practiced doing them. He has become skillful. </div>
<div id="tg_105" class="t s1_105">Scientists have been working for centuries to create robots. I don't see why they should </div>
<div id="th_105" class="t s1_105">be so much concerned about creating robots -- there are so many, millions of them! And </div>
<div id="ti_105" class="t s1_105">there is no need to make robots at all; all these millions of robots go on producing more </div>
<div id="tj_105" class="t s1_105">robots! In fact, the question is how to stop them from producing more! </div>
<div id="tk_105" class="t s1_105">Each fool leaves at least a dozen fools -- particularly in India -- behind him. When he </div>
<div id="tl_105" class="t s1_105">dies he makes the world twelve times more foolish; he leaves a dozen fools as a proof </div>
<div id="tm_105" class="t s1_105">that he has been here. What is the need of creating robots? </div>
<div id="tn_105" class="t s1_105">I was reading a story that robots have been created -- it is a twenty-first century story -- </div>
<div id="to_105" class="t s1_105">and they are so exactly like human beings that it is very difficult to distinguish. If you </div>
<div id="tp_105" class="t s1_105">meet a robot on the way driving his car you will not be able to distinguish whether he is </div>
<div id="tq_105" class="t s1_105">a robot or not. He will look exactly like a man. Only one difference will be there: he will </div>
<div id="tr_105" class="t s1_105">be more efficient. Less accidents will be there on the road. He will finish his work in </div>
<div id="ts_105" class="t s1_105">time. He will not go on piling up files on his table; his table will be clean. </div>
<div id="tt_105" class="t s1_105">So a few indications so you can judge whether the man is really a robot or a man. Once </div>
<div id="tu_105" class="t s1_105">in a while only you will know who is a robot -- when his battery runs down. Then </div>
<div id="tv_105" class="t s1_105">only... if he was talking to you and he was giving you great argument, philosophical </div>
<div id="tw_105" class="t s1_105">arguments for God's existence, and then he suddenly says, "Grrr, grrrr, grrr-rr-rrr...!" </div>
<div id="tx_105" class="t s1_105">and immediately runs towards the electric plug and connects himself to the electricity </div>
<div id="ty_105" class="t s1_105">to recharge himself -- then you will know that this is not a real man; otherwise there </div>
<div id="tz_105" class="t s1_105">will not be any difference. </div>
<div id="t10_105" class="t s1_105">And that, too, is possible to overcome sooner or later: we can fix two batteries. Why one </div>
<div id="t11_105" class="t s1_105">battery? I was worried: why fix one battery in the poor man? -- you can fix two batteries </div>
<div id="t12_105" class="t s1_105">so that while one is being used, the other is being charged automatically. If you can </div>
<div id="t13_105" class="t s1_105">create a robot, can't you create an automatic battery? Why make him look foolish: "Grrr, </div>
<div id="t14_105" class="t s1_105">grrr, grrr"? And this can happen any time. He is making love to his woman, and "Grrr, </div>
