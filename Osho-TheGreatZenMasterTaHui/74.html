<div id="t1_74" class="t s1_74">Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru tried to persuade him, saying, "There is every chance for you to</div>
<div id="t2_74" class="t s1_74">become the chief minister of your state." -- he was from Bihar, the land of Buddha.</div>
<div id="t3_74" class="t s1_74">But Maitreya said, "I want one thing understood clearly: ambition is hell and I am not</div>
<div id="t4_74" class="t s1_74">going to look back; politics is finished for me. All ambitions are finished for me." And since</div>
<div id="t5_74" class="t s1_74">then he has been with me.</div>
<div id="t6_74" class="t s1_74">He has never asked a single question. He has never doubted, his trust was absolute. In</div>
<div id="t7_74" class="t s1_74">these years, thousands of people have come to me; many have been lost, but he remained</div>
<div id="t8_74" class="t s1_74">unwavering. He could not conceive how people can find contradictions in my statements.</div>
<div id="t9_74" class="t s1_74">Sometime in 1984 Maitreya became enlightened, but he had chosen to remain silent, so he</div>
<div id="ta_74" class="t s1_74">remained silent. He did not even tell me what had happened to him. But the day it happened I</div>
<div id="tb_74" class="t s1_74">called a small meeting of a few sannyasins in Rancho Rajneesh in America. I declared that</div>
<div id="tc_74" class="t s1_74">there were going to be three special committees: one of mahasattvas, the great beings who are</div>
<div id="td_74" class="t s1_74">destined to become enlightened in this very life; the second of sambuddhas, who have already</div>
<div id="te_74" class="t s1_74">become enlightened; and the third of bodhisattvas, who will also become enlightened ... but</div>
<div id="tf_74" class="t s1_74">perhaps they will take a little longer than the other two categories, but certainly before their</div>
<div id="tg_74" class="t s1_74">death.</div>
<div id="th_74" class="t s1_74">Because I had included Maitreya's name, he was shocked. He wanted to keep it completely</div>
<div id="ti_74" class="t s1_74">to himself, not to say anything about enlightenment to anybody. As he left the meeting, he told</div>
<div id="tj_74" class="t s1_74">a few people outside, "It is very strange, I have not said -- I have been trying to hide it -- but</div>
<div id="tk_74" class="t s1_74">somehow he has seen it. And not only has he seen it, he has declared me enlightened."</div>
<div id="tl_74" class="t s1_74">And his response was truly a response of great love. He said, "Osho is really a rascal."</div>
<div id="tm_74" class="t s1_74">All these years before his enlightenment and after his enlightenment, he just remained</div>
<div id="tn_74" class="t s1_74">absolutely ordinary, with no ego, with no desire, with no greed.</div>
<div id="to_74" class="t s1_74">Just before I came back to Poona, Maitreya told me in Bombay, "I have got ten thousand</div>
<div id="tp_74" class="t s1_74">rupees in a post office deposit in Patna, Bihar; that's all I have, but now I will not need it."</div>
<div id="tq_74" class="t s1_74">Certainly he was becoming aware that his time of departure was coming closer. And he</div>
<div id="tr_74" class="t s1_74">transferred the money to Neelam for the ashram. He died without anything, any possessions.</div>
<div id="ts_74" class="t s1_74">And he slipped very slowly, very silently, from sleep into eternal sleep.</div>
<div id="tt_74" class="t s1_74">I am saying this evening is special, because one of us has moved from the world of mortals</div>
<div id="tu_74" class="t s1_74">to the world of immortals. He will not be born again. He has attained to the freedom and the</div>
<div id="tv_74" class="t s1_74">liberation we have been talking about.</div>
<div id="tw_74" class="t s1_74">This is a moment of great celebration and rejoicing. It happens very rarely. In millions of</div>
<div id="tx_74" class="t s1_74">people perhaps one comes to this silent explosion of light and disappears into the ocean of</div>
<div id="ty_74" class="t s1_74">consciousness that surrounds existence.</div>
<div id="tz_74" class="t s1_74">I would like these talks to be dedicated to Swami Anand Maitreya, who slipped from sleep</div>
<div id="t10_74" class="t s1_74">into eternal sleep. But he was not asleep! He has gone in full awakening. He has gone with</div>
<div id="t11_74" class="t s1_74">full awareness. You will keep him in your memories because he has shown the path to you,</div>
<div id="t12_74" class="t s1_74">too. He lived joyously, although he had nothing, and he died peacefully, blissfully.</div>
<div id="t13_74" class="t s1_74">That's what attaining to one's destiny means. Those who live in misery and die in misery</div>
<div id="t14_74" class="t s1_74">go on missing their destiny. They are failures, and because they have failed so many times,</div>
<div id="t15_74" class="t s1_74">they become accustomed to failing again and again. But even if one person amongst you</div>
<div id="t16_74" class="t s1_74">succeeds, it is your success, too. He has proved that what we have been talking about is not</div>
<div id="t17_74" class="t s1_74">mere philosophy -- it is an authentic path to self-realization.</div>
<div id="t18_74" class="t s1_74">Chapter 6 - Innocence</div>
<div id="t19_74" class="t s1_74">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1a_74" class="t s1_74">74</div>
