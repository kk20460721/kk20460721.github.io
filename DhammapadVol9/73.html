<div id="t1_73" class="t s1_73">Be with a true master. Just being with him, sitting by his side in deep silence, with no </div>
<div id="t2_73" class="t s1_73">prejudice, with no idea what is happening, something transpires. Something jumps </div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s1_73">from the master into your heart. You can feel it. It is energy, it is an energy </div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s1_73">phenomenon. It is not a question of a theory, of any hypothesis, of philosophy. It is a </div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s1_73">jump of energy, a quantum leap. Something invisible radiates from the true master and </div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s1_73">penetrates to the true disciple. And who is the true disciple? -- the one whose heart is </div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s1_73">open. </div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s1_73">And once you have felt the presence of the true master, Buddha says: GO WITH HIM </div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s1_73">JOYFULLY... not reluctantly, not with doubts -- joyfully, dancing, celebrating. You have </div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s1_73">found the master. There can be no greater blessing than that, because on the way you </div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s1_73">will find many problems without the master. The first step will not be possible; only the </div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s1_73">master can push you. And you can allow him to push you only if you trust. </div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s1_73">It is just like a new bird who has come out of the egg and sits on the edge of the nest, </div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s1_73">looks at his mother, father, parents, other birds flying in the sky. A great longing arises </div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s1_73">in his heart too. He flutters his wings, but he cannot gather courage; he is afraid he may </div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s1_73">fall down. He has never flown before. He does not know what it is all about, how these </div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s1_73">people are managing. They may be different, they may have certain qualities. Who </div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s1_73">knows that he has wings also? He can have a certain feeling that there are wings; he can </div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s1_73">see a certain similarity. But the fear of falling, of killing oneself or crippling oneself, is </div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s1_73">also there. </div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s1_73">The mother goes and calls from the tree far away, gives him a call. He wants to go, but </div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s1_73">the fear</div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s1_73">....</div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s1_73">The mother goes around the nest, flies, to show him that "What I am doing </div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s1_73">YOU can do." Slowly slowly, he gathers courage, and one day the mother simply </div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s1_73">pushes him. He has to be pushed. In spite of his fear, when he is pushed he can see that </div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s1_73">he opens his wings; he is able to balance himself. Of course, in the beginning it is a little </div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s1_73">awkward, but soon he becomes efficient. </div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s1_73">Without the master the first step is difficult, the most difficult thing. How to move into </div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s1_73">the unknown if there is nobody to push you? But the master can push you only if you </div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s1_73">trust him, if you love him. It is just like the bird loves the mother and he knows that </div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s1_73">whatsoever she is doing she will not do any harm. Out of that trust he allows her to </div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s1_73">push him; in fact, deep down he wants to be pushed. He knows, "I cannot do it on my </div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s1_73">own." But if the mother is doing it she must be doing it right. </div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s1_73">When the disciple feels such a love affair with the master, then things become possible. </div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s1_73">And then there are many dangers on the way. The first step is the most difficult; then as </div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s1_73">you move deeper and deeper many more things have to be dropped. Who is going to </div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s1_73">tell you what to drop and what not to drop? It is all unknown to you. Somebody needs </div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s1_73">to constantly watch you. </div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s1_73">And then comes the last step, when the ego dies. That is also very difficult -- it seems as </div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s1_73">if YOU are dying. The master has to help you die because only through death you will </div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s1_73">be reborn. The master has to help you understand that this is not death. The seed </div>
<div id="t17_73" class="t s1_73">disappearing in the soil is not dying; it is really being born as a tree. And the river </div>
<div id="t18_73" class="t s1_73">disappearing in the ocean is not dying, it is simply becoming the ocean. It is not losing </div>
<div id="t19_73" class="t s1_73">anything, it is gaining much more. It is losing nothing and gaining all. </div>
