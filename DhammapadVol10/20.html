<div id="t1_20" class="t s1_20">to them? Centuries of priesthoods, of different religions, have been giving them false </div>
<div id="t2_20" class="t s1_20">consolations. All those false consolations are no longer applicable. Man has become </div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">more adult. It is good to give children toys to play with, but when somebody comes of </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">age and you go on giving him toys to play with, he will start feeling life is meaningless. </div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s1_20">He needs something more; he needs something more real. </div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s1_20">Beware of being led by blind people! </div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s1_20">A young woman, hardly more than a girl, went to see the local rabbi. "You don't know </div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">me," she began with a catch in her throat, "but I just had to speak to somebody. You see, </div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">I have no mother or father and I don't know much about worldly matters." </div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">"You don't have to say another word," said the rabbi. "I understand perfectly. It is a </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">man, isn't it?" </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">"Yes, and he is always trying to kiss me. Kiss, kiss, kiss -- that's all he ever thinks of." </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">You must be firm," said the rabbi sternly. "That kind of man you don't need. Just tell </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">him you don't allow such kinds of goings-on." </div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s1_20">As she left, the rabbi said, "Come back in a week and let me know how you are making </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s1_20">out." </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">Sure enough, the girl returned a week later, but this time she was even more disturbed </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">than before. </div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">"What is the matter now?" asked the rabbi. </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">"I stopped him from all that kissing," said the unhappy young lady, "but now -- well, I </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s1_20">don't know how to put it</div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s1_20">....</div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s1_20">" </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s1_20">"Put, put!" urged the rabbi. "With me you got nothing to be ashamed." </div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s1_20">"He's trying to -- er -- touch me with his hands," she stammered in embarrassment. </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s1_20">The rabbi rose from his chair in righteous anger. "You tell that no-goodnik he should </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s1_20">keep his dirty hands to himself!" barked the rabbi. "What kind of a way is that to treat a </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">decent Jewish girl? Tell him to stop at once, you hear?" </div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s1_20">But when she visited the rabbi again she was almost in tears. "I did everything you </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s1_20">said," moaned the girl, "but now he insists he wants to sleep with me." </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">"What!" yelled the outraged rabbi. "I never heard of such chutzpah in my whole life. </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">You go right home and the next time you see him I want you to throw that bum out of </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s1_20">the house. You understand? I am ordering you! Throw him out!" </div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s1_20">A few days later she visited the rabbi once more. Her eyes were red from weeping and </div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s1_20">her face was a picture of misery. </div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s1_20">"Did you do like I ordered?" demanded the rabbi. </div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s1_20">She nodded, and, still sobbing, she said through her tears, "Now he wants a divorce!" </div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s1_20">Your priests are as unconscious as you are, or even more. They are not even aware of </div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s1_20">the situation man is passing through. They go on handing out old recipes which are no </div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s1_20">more relevant. They go on giving you great advice which may have been useful </div>
<div id="t15_20" class="t s1_20">sometime in the past but is utterly out of context in the present situation. </div>
<div id="t16_20" class="t s1_20">You don't need more priests and their help. You need a few awakened people in the </div>
<div id="t17_20" class="t s1_20">world. You need more meditators -- not mediators. The priests have been mediators </div>
