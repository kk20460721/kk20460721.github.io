<div id="t1_8" class="t s1_8">much worried about it, hmm? because Buddhists say there are seven bodies and Jains say </div>
<div id="t2_8" class="t s1_8">there are nine: bodies. Nothing wrong and there is no contradiction because these are just </div>
<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">maps. If you are studying the whole world's map, then even big cities disappear, even big </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">rivers disappear. If you are studying a map of a nation, then many new things appear </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">which were not on the world map. And if you are studying the map of a province, then </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">many more things appear. And if you are studying the map of a district, of course many </div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s1_8">more. And if just of one city, then many more. And if just of one house, then of course</div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">....</div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">Things go on appearing; it depends. </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">Jains say nine, Buddha says seven, Patanjali says five. There are schools which say only </div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s1_8">three. And they all are true because they are not discussing any argument. They are just </div>
<div id="tc_8" class="t s1_8">giving you a few tools to work with. </div>
<div id="td_8" class="t s1_8">And I think five is almost the perfect amount. Because more than five is too much, less </div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s1_8">than five is too few. Five seems almost perfect. And Patanjali is a very balanced thinker. </div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s1_8">Now a few things about these chakras. The first chakra, the first dynamic center, is sex -- </div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s1_8">muladhar. It joins you with nature, it-joins you with the past, it joins you with the future. </div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s1_8">You were born out of two persons' sexual play. Your parents' sexual play became the </div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">cause of your birth. You are related to your parents through the sex center, and to your </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">parents' parents and so on and so forth. To the whole past you are related through the sex </div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">center; the thread runs through the sex center. And if you give birth to some child, you </div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">will be related to the future. </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">Jesus insists many times, in a very rude way, "If you don't hate your mother and your </div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s1_8">father, you cannot come and follow me." It looks almost hard, almost unbelievable that a </div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s1_8">man like Jesus -- why should he use such hard words? And he is compassion incarnate, </div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s1_8">and he is love. Why does he say, "Hate your mother, hate yom father if you want to </div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s1_8">follow me"? The meaning is: drop out of the sexual context. What he is saying </div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s1_8">symbolically is: go beyond the sex center. Then immediately you are no longer related </div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s1_8">with the past, no longer related with the future. </div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s1_8">It is sex that makes you part of time. Once you go beyond sex, you become part of </div>
<div id="tu_8" class="t s1_8">eternity, not of time. Then suddenly only the present exists. You are the present, but if </div>
<div id="tv_8" class="t s1_8">you see yourself through the sex center, you are the past also because your eyes will have </div>
<div id="tw_8" class="t s1_8">the color of your mother and your father and your body will have atoms and cells from </div>
<div id="tx_8" class="t s1_8">millions of generations. Your whole structure, biostructure, is part of a long continuum. </div>
<div id="ty_8" class="t s1_8">You are part of a big chain. </div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s1_8">In India they say your debt to your parents cannot be fulfilled unless you give birth to </div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">children. If you want that your debt should be fulfilled with the past, you have to create </div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s1_8">future. If you really want to repay, there is no other way. Your mother loved you, your </div>
<div id="t12_8" class="t s1_8">father loved you -- what can you do now, they are gone? You can become a mother, a </div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s1_8">father, to children and repay it to nature, to the same reservoir from where your parents </div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s1_8">came, you came, your children will come. </div>
<div id="t15_8" class="t s1_8">Sex is the great chain. It is the whole chain of the world -- samsar; and it is the link with </div>
<div id="t16_8" class="t s1_8">others. Have you watched it? The moment you feel sexual you start thinking of the other. </div>
<div id="t17_8" class="t s1_8">When you are not feeling sexual you never think of the other. A person who is beyond </div>
<div id="t18_8" class="t s1_8">sex is beyond others. He may live in the society, but he is not in the society. He may be </div>
<div id="t19_8" class="t s1_8">walking in the crowd, but he walks alone. And a man who is sexual, he may be sitting on </div>
<div id="t1a_8" class="t s1_8">the top of Everest, alone, but he will think of the other. He may be sent to the moon to </div>
<div id="t1b_8" class="t s1_8">meditate, but he will meditate about the other. </div>
