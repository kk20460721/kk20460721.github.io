<div id="t1_61" class="t s1_61">In fact, in the west, it is very difficult to teach people the non-action mode. So he </div>
<div id="t2_61" class="t s1_61">was teaching techniques. methods of how to become integrated. He would say, </div>
<div id="t3_61" class="t s1_61">"There is no soul already there." Not that there is no soul, and not that he was not </div>
<div id="t4_61" class="t s1_61">aware of it; but it was a device. People had become very lethargic about the soul. </div>
<div id="t5_61" class="t s1_61">They thought it was already there -- So why worry, why bother? It is there. Any </div>
<div id="t6_61" class="t s1_61">day we can find it, so let us in the meanwhile find other things which are not </div>
<div id="t7_61" class="t s1_61">already there. Meanwhile, let us find beautiful women, more wine, more money, </div>
<div id="t8_61" class="t s1_61">more power -- things which are not there. So let us seek these. And the day we </div>
<div id="t9_61" class="t s1_61">are fed-up with all this, at any moment, we will close our eyes and we will go in, </div>
<div id="ta_61" class="t s1_61">and the soul will be there. It is never lost; you cannot lose it and you cannot gain </div>
<div id="tb_61" class="t s1_61">it. It is already there." So people have become very lethargic. </div>
<div id="tc_61" class="t s1_61">You can see it in the east. The whole east has become so lousy and lethargic. The </div>
<div id="td_61" class="t s1_61">soul is there and everybody knows it, everybody has heard it. God is within the </div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s1_61">heart, He is already there, so why create any fuss about Him? People seek that </div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s1_61">which is not there. </div>
<div id="tg_61" class="t s1_61">Gurdjieff became aware of this fact: that the theory that the soul is already there </div>
<div id="th_61" class="t s1_61">had made people very lethargic, very uninterested in the soul; very uninterested, </div>
<div id="ti_61" class="t s1_61">absolutely uninterested in the inner world. The mind is interested only in that </div>
<div id="tj_61" class="t s1_61">which gives a challenge. which is an adventure. So Gurdjieff, to fit with the </div>
<div id="tk_61" class="t s1_61">western mind, started saying that the soul is not there: "Don't sit patiently, do </div>
<div id="tl_61" class="t s1_61">something -- because when persons die, all persons don't survive. Only those </div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s1_61">who have integrated their centers will survive. Others will simply disappear like </div>
<div id="tn_61" class="t s1_61">vegetables, So it is for you choose. You are taking a risk," Gurdjieff said. "If you </div>
<div id="to_61" class="t s1_61">do something -- and doing means arduous doing, hard work, a whole life </div>
<div id="tp_61" class="t s1_61">devoted </div>
<div id="tq_61" class="t s1_61">-- then only will you be able to survive death. Otherwise you are going </div>
<div id="tr_61" class="t s1_61">to be discarded. You will be thrown in the junkyard. God is not going to choose </div>
<div id="ts_61" class="t s1_61">you unless you are integrated. You have to EARN it. Only very few will be saved </div>
<div id="tt_61" class="t s1_61">after death, not all." </div>
<div id="tu_61" class="t s1_61">This is a very strange theory, never propounded before, never in the whole </div>
<div id="tv_61" class="t s1_61">history of humanity. There have been people who say, "There is no soul." We </div>
<div id="tw_61" class="t s1_61">know them; they are atheists. They have always been there. There are people </div>
<div id="tx_61" class="t s1_61">who say, "There is soul, and it cannot be destroyed. Even death cannot destroy </div>
<div id="ty_61" class="t s1_61">it." We have heard about them; they have always been there. But Gurdjieff was </div>
<div id="tz_61" class="t s1_61">saying something absolutely new, something which had never been said before. </div>
<div id="t10_61" class="t s1_61">He was saying, "Soul is possible; it is not actual. It is simply possible. You may </div>
<div id="t11_61" class="t s1_61">attain to it, you may not attain to it -- you may miss it. There is more possibility </div>
<div id="t12_61" class="t s1_61">that you will miss it, because the way you are living, you are not earning it." </div>
<div id="t13_61" class="t s1_61">Gurdjieff said, "Man is like a seed. It is not necessary that the seed will become a </div>
<div id="t14_61" class="t s1_61">tree. It is not necessary -- the seed may not find the right soil. Even if the right </div>
<div id="t15_61" class="t s1_61">soil is found, there may be no rains. Or even if there are rains, animals may come </div>
<div id="t16_61" class="t s1_61">and destroy the plant. There are a thousand and one difficulties. The seed is not </div>
<div id="t17_61" class="t s1_61">going to necessarily be a tree. If one thousand and one protections are taken, only </div>
<div id="t18_61" class="t s1_61">then will the seed become a tree. You are not a soul; you are just a possibility. A </div>
