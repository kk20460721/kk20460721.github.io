<div id="t1_349" class="t s1_349">But Buddha had just left his mind. He came back, opened his eyes and said, "Ananda, I</div>
<div id="t2_349" class="t s1_349">would not like it to be on record that when I was still alive somebody had come to ask, and I</div>
<div id="t3_349" class="t s1_349">did not answer. Let the man come. I have just gone beyond the mind; It is not much trouble</div>
<div id="t4_349" class="t s1_349">for me to come back, because that has been happening my whole life. The moment I talk to</div>
<div id="t5_349" class="t s1_349">you, I have to come to the mind. The moment I am not talking to you, I move away from it.</div>
<div id="t6_349" class="t s1_349">There is no problem. Don't take it seriously."</div>
<div id="t7_349" class="t s1_349">The man had many questions in his mind, but the situation was such that he forgot all. He</div>
<div id="t8_349" class="t s1_349">simply said, "I used to think that I had many questions, but looking at you, I only want to ask</div>
<div id="t9_349" class="t s1_349">you one question: What should I ask you? There is not much time ... you had just entered the</div>
<div id="ta_349" class="t s1_349">boat and now you have come back out. I cannot waste your time in unnecessary things; just</div>
<div id="tb_349" class="t s1_349">tell me exactly what is the question."</div>
<div id="tc_349" class="t s1_349">Gautam Buddha said:. "It was worth coming back. You are a man who may not have been</div>
<div id="td_349" class="t s1_349">very alert in life, who may not have realized your potential, but in this moment you are</div>
<div id="te_349" class="t s1_349">showing your pure intelligence. The question is only one: you are the question and you are the</div>
<div id="tf_349" class="t s1_349">answer. You in your unawareness is the question; you as awareness is the answer."</div>
<div id="tg_349" class="t s1_349">And it is said that that man became enlightened. The situation was such ... Buddha came</div>
<div id="th_349" class="t s1_349">back. There were ten thousand monks with tears in their eyes, and silence all around. Buddha</div>
<div id="ti_349" class="t s1_349">had condensed his whole philosophy: "You as ignorance is the question, and you as alert</div>
<div id="tj_349" class="t s1_349">awareness, you as consciousness, is the answer."</div>
<div id="tk_349" class="t s1_349">And how does one becomes conscious? Just by being thoroughgoing, just by being total in</div>
<div id="tl_349" class="t s1_349">every act. "Be as alert," says Ta Hui "as if you are CROSSING A BRIDGE MADE OF A</div>

<div id="tn_349" class="t s1_349">AND FEET SLIP, YOU CAN'T EVEN PRESERVE YOUR OWN LIFE, MUCH LESS</div>
<div id="to_349" class="t s1_349">SAVE OTHERS."</div>
<div id="tp_349" class="t s1_349">In such a situation you will become absolutely aware. You will be simply awareness,</div>
<div id="tq_349" class="t s1_349">nothing else. Just a purity, a luminosity ... and that is enlightenment, the great affair. Your</div>
<div id="tr_349" class="t s1_349">seeking the path is really nothing but seeking awareness, Ta Hui reminds you.</div>
<div id="ts_349" class="t s1_349">Mu Chou once said: "AN OBVIOUS CASE. I FORGIVE YOU THIRTY BLOWS." Now</div>
<div id="tt_349" class="t s1_349">Zen has special methods of its own, not developed by any other tradition. Mu Chou is one of</div>
<div id="tu_349" class="t s1_349">the great masters who used to hit his disciples with his stick when they would bring the</div>
<div id="tv_349" class="t s1_349">answer to a koan meditation. They were asked to meditate on a koan. A koan is a puzzle</div>
<div id="tw_349" class="t s1_349">which has no answer, and they were told to find out the answer, "and when you have found it,</div>
<div id="tx_349" class="t s1_349">come."</div>
<div id="ty_349" class="t s1_349">Naturally every answer was going to be wrong. The sound of one hand clapping ... now</div>
<div id="tz_349" class="t s1_349">what answer is going to be right? So Mu Chou did not wait for their answers. He would</div>
<div id="t10_349" class="t s1_349">simply hit them and tell them, "Go back, your answer was wrong. Meditate again; find the</div>
<div id="t11_349" class="t s1_349">right answer."</div>
<div id="t12_349" class="t s1_349">He was known as a crazy master -- at least he should have the generosity to listen to the</div>
<div id="t13_349" class="t s1_349">poor disciple's answer. The disciple had been meditating day in, day out, and he has found</div>
<div id="t14_349" class="t s1_349">some answer -- he had heard the wind passing through the pine trees and the music ... he had</div>
<div id="t15_349" class="t s1_349">heard the sound of running water and he thought, "Perhaps this is it!" -- and he had run</div>
<div id="t16_349" class="t s1_349">immediately to the master to tell him that he had heard the sound of one hand clapping, with</div>
<div id="t17_349" class="t s1_349">great expectation. But the master was really a hard taskmaster! He would hit him even before</div>
<div id="t18_349" class="t s1_349">he had uttered a single word.</div>
