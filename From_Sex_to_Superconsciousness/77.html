<div id="t1_77" class="t s1_77">CHAPTER 5. FROM LUST TO THE LORD</div>
<div id="t2_77" class="t s2_77">But, how can you hit your boss? Is there a man who does not feel like hitting his boss at some point?</div>
<div id="t3_77" class="t s2_77">Such an employee is rare.</div>
<div id="t4_77" class="t s2_77">In any case, the man went on suppressing the desire to hit his boss, but he began to develop a</div>
<div id="t5_77" class="t s2_77">complex about it, and, afraid he might actually hit his boss someday, he started leaving his shoes at</div>
<div id="t6_77" class="t s2_77">home. But he could not forget about the shoes. Whenever he saw his boss, his hands automatically</div>
<div id="t7_77" class="t s2_77">went towards his feet.</div>
<div id="t8_77" class="t s2_77">But fortunately the shoes had been left at home, and he felt a bit easier</div>
<div id="t9_77" class="t s2_77">because he knew that one day, in a frenzy, he just might take off a shoe and throw it at his boss.</div>
<div id="ta_77" class="t s2_77">But he didn’t free himself of the shoes just by leaving them at home; they continued to loom large</div>
<div id="tb_77" class="t s2_77">on his conscience. If he were ﬁddling with a pen, he drew shoes on the paper; in idle moments, he</div>
<div id="tc_77" class="t s2_77">sketched the shape of a shoe. The shoes ﬁlled his thoughts, and he was mortally afraid he would</div>
<div id="td_77" class="t s2_77">attack his boss sometime.</div>
<div id="te_77" class="t s2_77">At home, he told his family it was better if he did not go to the ofﬁce at all. Now, his mental condition</div>
<div id="tf_77" class="t s2_77">was such that he did not need his own shoes: he might grab anyone’s shoes to hit his boss; his</div>
<div id="tg_77" class="t s2_77">hands had even started moving towards the feet of his colleagues. At this point, his family decided</div>
<div id="th_77" class="t s2_77">it was high time he was taken to a psychiatrist. And so he went.</div>
<div id="ti_77" class="t s2_77">The psychiatrist said his sickness was nothing much to worry about, that it was curable. He advised</div>
<div id="tj_77" class="t s2_77">him to hang a picture of his boss at home and to hit it with a shoe ﬁve times every morning. The</div>
<div id="tk_77" class="t s2_77">photo was to be hit religiously, before he went to the ofﬁce, and furthermore, he was not to miss a</div>
<div id="tl_77" class="t s2_77">single day. The ritual was to be observed daily, just like morning prayers, and then, after returning</div>
<div id="tm_77" class="t s2_77">from the ofﬁce each day, the process was to be repeated.</div>
<div id="tn_77" class="t s2_77">The man’s ﬁrst reaction was, ”What nonsense!” Although he was astonished at the idea, he felt quite</div>
<div id="to_77" class="t s2_77">happy about it. The photo was hung and, accordingly, he began the prescribed ritual.</div>
<div id="tp_77" class="t s2_77">On the very ﬁrst day, when he went to the ofﬁce after hitting the photo ﬁve times, he noticed a</div>
<div id="tq_77" class="t s2_77">strange sensation: he did not feel as angry at his boss as he had. And, within a fortnight, he had</div>
<div id="tr_77" class="t s2_77">become very polite to his employer. His boss also noticed the change in him, but of course he was</div>
<div id="ts_77" class="t s2_77">unaware of what had been going on. He also told his employee that he had become very polite,</div>
<div id="tt_77" class="t s2_77">very obedient and very nice indeed of late and wanted to know what had happened. The employee</div>
<div id="tu_77" class="t s2_77">replied, ”Please don’t ask me about it or everything will be topsy-turvy again. I just can’t tell you.”</div>
<div id="tv_77" class="t s2_77">What is the truth behind this story? Can anything really be achieved just by hitting a photo? Yes –</div>
<div id="tw_77" class="t s2_77">by hitting the photo, the man’s obsession to hit his boss with a shoe simply dissolved, faded away.</div>
<div id="tx_77" class="t s2_77">Temples like those of Khajuraho, Konarak and Puri should be in every nook and corner of this</div>
<div id="ty_77" class="t s2_77">country.</div>
<div id="tz_77" class="t s2_77">There is nothing important to be found in other temples; there is nothing scientiﬁc, no</div>
<div id="t10_77" class="t s2_77">planning, no meaning in them.</div>
<div id="t11_77" class="t s2_77">They are not needed at all.</div>
<div id="t12_77" class="t s2_77">But the existence of the Khajuraho</div>
<div id="t13_77" class="t s2_77">temples and others like them is full of meaning. Anyone whose mind is overly anxious about sex</div>
<div id="t14_77" class="t s2_77">should go there and meditate. When he returns, he will be light of heart; he will be at peace.</div>
<div id="t15_77" class="t s2_77">The Tantrikas tried to transform sex into spirituality, but the preachers of morality in our country did</div>
<div id="t16_77" class="t s2_77">not allow the message to reach the masses. These are the same people who wanted to put a stop</div>
<div id="t17_77" class="t s2_77">to my talks.</div>
<div id="t18_77" class="t s2_77">From Sex to Superconsciousness</div>
<div id="t19_77" class="t s2_77">77</div>
<div id="t1a_77" class="t s3_77">Osho</div>
