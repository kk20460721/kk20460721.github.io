<div id="t1_6" class="t s1_6">chariots, how much gold, how many diamonds. They go on and on and on. </div>
<div id="t2_6" class="t s1_6">Why? Why have these accounts been kept? And the reality is that he was never a </div>
<div id="t3_6" class="t s1_6">very great king. the kingdom was very small, not more than a small district. And </div>
<div id="t4_6" class="t s1_6">his father was not more than a collector of a district, not more than that. Because </div>
<div id="t5_6" class="t s1_6">in Mahavir's time India was divided into two thousand kingdoms, so it could not </div>
<div id="t6_6" class="t s1_6">be very great. And it is almost impossible that he had so many elephants and so </div>
<div id="t7_6" class="t s1_6">many chariots and so much gold, it is exaggeration. But people understand only </div>
<div id="t8_6" class="t s1_6">the language of money. They exaggerate, because that is the only way to prove </div>
<div id="t9_6" class="t s1_6">that Mahavir was very great. Had he been the son of a carpenter, nobody would </div>
<div id="ta_6" class="t s1_6">have ever bothered about him. </div>
<div id="tb_6" class="t s1_6">Jesus is a revolution in the world of religion. He is the first poor man who </div>
<div id="tc_6" class="t s1_6">declared, "I am the son of God." He is the first poor man who dared to declare, "I </div>
<div id="td_6" class="t s1_6">am a prophet, a teerthankera, an avatar." Never before had such a thing </div>
<div id="te_6" class="t s1_6">happened in the history of man. He opened the way for many others to follow. </div>
<div id="tf_6" class="t s1_6">Then Mohammed could declare, and then came Kabir, and Sena, and Nanak, and </div>
<div id="tg_6" class="t s1_6">Dadu, and many more. Jesus opened the gate -- that even a poor man who had </div>
<div id="th_6" class="t s1_6">nothing to renounce, can renounce, because the real renunciation is not of </div>
<div id="ti_6" class="t s1_6">wealth, but of the ego. The real renunciation is not of wealth, let me repeat it, but </div>
<div id="tj_6" class="t s1_6">of the ego. It is not a question of renouncing what you have, it is a question of </div>
<div id="tk_6" class="t s1_6">renouncing what you are. You can have much and you can renounce that. But if </div>
<div id="tl_6" class="t s1_6">the ego continues -- and it can continue -- it can be fulfilled by having much, it </div>
<div id="tm_6" class="t s1_6">can be fulfil]ed by renouncing much. And if the ego is there, you remain </div>
<div id="tn_6" class="t s1_6">ordinary, you remain superficial. </div>
<div id="to_6" class="t s1_6">AND THEY WERE OFFENDED IN HIM. Had he been an emperor's son, they </div>
<div id="tp_6" class="t s1_6">would have fallen at his feet. But he was just an ordinary carpenter's son and </div>
<div id="tq_6" class="t s1_6">everybody in the village knew about him. </div>
<div id="tr_6" class="t s1_6">BUT JESUS SAID UNTO THEM, A PROPHET IS NOT WITHOUT HONOUR, </div>
<div id="ts_6" class="t s1_6">SAVE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, AND IN HIS OWN HOUSE. </div>
<div id="tt_6" class="t s1_6">A great insight. Why has it happened so many times, that people who are closest </div>
<div id="tu_6" class="t s1_6">always misunderstand? We should have expected just the contrary, that the </div>
<div id="tv_6" class="t s1_6">people of Jesus' village would understand him first. Before anyone else would </div>
<div id="tw_6" class="t s1_6">understand him, the people of Jesus' house, family, relatives, would understand </div>
<div id="tx_6" class="t s1_6">him first. But it doesn't happen. Why? A deep insight into the human ego is </div>
<div id="ty_6" class="t s1_6">needed to understand it. With those who are close to you, it is very difficult to </div>
<div id="tz_6" class="t s1_6">believe that they had gone beyond and above you. If somebody else who is not </div>
<div id="t10_6" class="t s1_6">close to you goes beyond you, maybe you are not bothered -- he is so far away, </div>
<div id="t11_6" class="t s1_6">the competitive ego does not arise. But if your own brother goes and you are left </div>
<div id="t12_6" class="t s1_6">behind -- and you were born to the same parents, you lived in the same house, </div>
<div id="t13_6" class="t s1_6">and you were educated in the same school; and your own brother goes so far </div>
<div id="t14_6" class="t s1_6">away -- your ego is hurt. Then what have you been doing? You feel defeated, you </div>
<div id="t15_6" class="t s1_6">feel a loser. Then the easiest way is to deny that he has gone beyond, then the </div>
<div id="t16_6" class="t s1_6">easiest way is to prove that he is just as ordinary as you are ordinary. The easiest </div>
<div id="t17_6" class="t s1_6">way is to disprove his claim, to deny. </div>
