<div id="t2_127" class="t s1_127">pure. The moment it was heard by people it became impure. When it was recorded -- </div>
<div id="t3_127" class="t s1_127">and remember it was recorded after many years, after three hundred years...now can </div>
<div id="t4_127" class="t s1_127">you imagine that people can record after three hundred years exactly the same thing </div>
<div id="t5_127" class="t s1_127">that Buddha said? It is impossible! People are people; they will automatically destroy it, </div>
<div id="t6_127" class="t s1_127">distort it -- they will give their own colors to it. </div>
<div id="t7_127" class="t s1_127">The day Buddha died, his followers were divided into thirty-six schools -- immediately! </div>
<div id="t8_127" class="t s1_127">Thirty-six interpretations. Nobody was agreeing on what he said, or even if they were </div>
<div id="t9_127" class="t s1_127">agreeing about the words, they were not agreeing about the meaning that was given to </div>
<div id="ta_127" class="t s1_127">the words. </div>
<div id="tb_127" class="t s1_127">I am reminded: </div>
<div id="tc_127" class="t s1_127">In the last year of his life, Sigmund Freud called all his disciples -- the important ones, </div>
<div id="td_127" class="t s1_127">the chief ones. He was feeling death coming close by, he must have heard the first steps </div>
<div id="te_127" class="t s1_127">of death, and he wanted to have a last gathering. </div>
<div id="tf_127" class="t s1_127">They were sitting at the table, nearabout thirty people from all over the world -- all the </div>
<div id="tg_127" class="t s1_127">chief disciples -- and they started arguing about something that Freud had said a few </div>
<div id="th_127" class="t s1_127">days before. Freud was there! He was the host, but they completely forgot about Freud. </div>
<div id="ti_127" class="t s1_127">They became so involved in the argument: somebody was saying one thing, and </div>
<div id="tj_127" class="t s1_127">somebody else was saying something else, and somebody else was contradicting both. </div>
<div id="tk_127" class="t s1_127">And they were arguing about what Freud really meant</div>
<div id="tl_127" class="t s1_127">....</div>
<div id="tm_127" class="t s1_127">And Freud watched, listened, </div>
<div id="tn_127" class="t s1_127">and then shouted, "Stop all this nonsense! Do you think I am dead? I am here, present -- </div>
<div id="to_127" class="t s1_127">why don't you ask me what my meaning was? And if you can do this to me while I am </div>
<div id="tp_127" class="t s1_127">alive, what are you going to do when I am dead? You don't bother to ask me, and you </div>
<div id="tq_127" class="t s1_127">have wasted one hour in arguing with each other, fighting, getting irritated, annoyed, </div>
<div id="tr_127" class="t s1_127">shouting at each other...and the master is present!" </div>
<div id="ts_127" class="t s1_127">And Freud is not an enlightened man. If this can happen to an unenlightened person, </div>
<div id="tt_127" class="t s1_127">what about the Buddha who speaks from the highest peaks of existence? The moment </div>
<div id="tu_127" class="t s1_127">he utters something, it is no longer the same as it was in his heart. When it is heard, it is </div>
<div id="tv_127" class="t s1_127">no longer the same as it was uttered. When it is interpreted, it is totally something else. </div>
<div id="tw_127" class="t s1_127">Many times I will criticize. Many times I will tell you about all the advantages and all </div>
<div id="tx_127" class="t s1_127">the disadvantages that have happened. Buddha is the purest religious dimension, the </div>
<div id="ty_127" class="t s1_127">purest possible, but how can I avoid saying that he is a one-dimensional man? If I don't </div>
<div id="tz_127" class="t s1_127">say it, it will be untrue. If I don't say it, my love for truth is not total then. I have to say </div>
<div id="t10_127" class="t s1_127">it, that he is one-dimensional -- the purest in his dimension, but he lacks the other </div>
<div id="t11_127" class="t s1_127">dimensions. </div>
<div id="t12_127" class="t s1_127">He has no appreciation of beauty, not at all. He has no appreciation of music, not at all. </div>
<div id="t13_127" class="t s1_127">He has no appreciation of love, not at all. The aesthetic dimension is missing, he has </div>
<div id="t14_127" class="t s1_127">bypassed it. And he has no scientific approach; he cannot have -- science was not yet </div>
<div id="t15_127" class="t s1_127">developed enough. He is one-dimensional purity, but one-dimensional. </div>
<div id="t16_127" class="t s1_127">And because he is one-dimensional, this whole country has remained one-dimensional. </div>
<div id="t17_127" class="t s1_127">Buddha is one-dimensional, Mahavira is one-dimensional, Patanjali is one-dimensional. </div>
