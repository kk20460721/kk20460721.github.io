<div id="t3_242" class="t s1_242">the whole of history, China has been the most populated land in the world. </div>
<div id="t4_242" class="t s1_242">And if Buddhism was spreading like wildfire, it was time to give it a solid </div>
<div id="t5_242" class="t s1_242">foundation. Bodhidharma had been specially sent as a messenger because </div>
<div id="t6_242" class="t s1_242">although during the six hundred years before Bodhidharma, thousands of </div>
<div id="t7_242" class="t s1_242">Buddhist scholars had gone to China at the invitation of emperors to translate all </div>
<div id="t8_242" class="t s1_242">Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, not a single one had been enlightened. </div>
<div id="t9_242" class="t s1_242">So Bodhidharma was sent specially to give people a certain taste of what </div>
<div id="ta_242" class="t s1_242">enlightenment is. They had heard the word, they were enchanted with the idea, a </div>
<div id="tb_242" class="t s1_242">great longing had arisen in millions of people to attain to enlightenment, but </div>
<div id="tc_242" class="t s1_242">they had not even seen an enlightened person. His presence, his silence, his </div>

<div id="te_242" class="t s1_242">By sending Bodhidharma Pragyatara had a certain specific purpose in her mind: </div>
<div id="tf_242" class="t s1_242">to give China its first enlightened master. The trouble was that he could not say </div>
<div id="tg_242" class="t s1_242">anything against Mahayana that would disturb all the new initiates into </div>
<div id="th_242" class="t s1_242">Buddhism. He could not say anything against Gautam Buddha, because nobody </div>
<div id="ti_242" class="t s1_242">was going to listen to him. </div>
<div id="tj_242" class="t s1_242">They were so much impressed with Gautam Buddha and his life and his </div>
<div id="tk_242" class="t s1_242">teachings that in just six hundred years, they created thirty thousand temples </div>
<div id="tl_242" class="t s1_242">and monasteries. Two million people were initiated as Buddhist monks and </div>
<div id="tm_242" class="t s1_242">almost the whole country became Buddhist. They may not all have been monks </div>
<div id="tn_242" class="t s1_242">but they were laymen; they had started the journey hoping that one day they </div>

<div id="t11_242" class="t s1_242">upon his shoulders. </div>
<div id="t12_242" class="t s1_242">As far as superficial questions were concerned, he was perfectly right and </div>

<div id="t16_242" class="t s1_242">does ignorance come?" ...if he had accepted his innocence, if he had announced, </div>
<div id="t17_242" class="t s1_242">"I know how awareness can be created, but I don't know from where ignorance </div>
<div id="t18_242" class="t s1_242">comes. Perhaps ignorance is forever there." </div>
<div id="t19_242" class="t s1_242">Ignorance never comes; it is just like darkness. Have you ever seen darkness </div>
<div id="t1a_242" class="t s1_242">coming or going? You always see light coming in and the darkness is not there. </div>
<div id="t1b_242" class="t s1_242">You always see light going out and the darkness is there. Darkness is always </div>
<div id="t1c_242" class="t s1_242">there -- no coming, no going. It is the light that comes and goes. Darkness is </div>
<div id="t1d_242" class="t s1_242">simply the absence of light. </div>
<div id="t1e_242" class="t s1_242">This would have been the perfect answer to the people: that darkness has always </div>
<div id="t1f_242" class="t s1_242">been there. There is no source for it because it is non-existential. Only something </div>
<div id="t1g_242" class="t s1_242">that exists can have some source. Light has source. In the same way, awareness </div>
