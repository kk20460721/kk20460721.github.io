<div id="t2_21" class="t s1_21">your knowledge, because your knowledge is basically false, borrowed. </div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">Before you can be made familiar with the truth, the untrue has to be taken away. </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">Sometimes the master has to be very merciless, and sometimes the master has to say </div>

<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">percent of people, Gurdjieff is right. </div>

<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">to Gopi Krishna! What kind of genius has he? At the most, the only proof that he has </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">given of his genius is some absolutely worthless poetry, just like the poetry </div>

<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">And now he is propounding around the world that when kundalini arises your latent </div>

<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">What Gopi Krishna is talking about is not kundalini but kundabuffer. Gurdjieff would </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">have put him right with a single blow. But he attracts people. People are very much </div>

<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">about it, Sufis are absolutely unaware of this energy called kundalini. Only Hindu yoga </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">talks about it. </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">There IS something in it, but not exactly the way it is told to people. The knowledge that </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">is floating around about kundalini is all nonsense, and Gurdjieff was right to condemn </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">it. He was condemning the whole theosophical movement. Theosophists were very </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">much against Gurdjieff. They knew nothing, but they created a great movement. They </div>

<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">Gurdjieff shattered many beliefs. He shattered one of the most fundamental beliefs of </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">the whole of humanity. He said, "There is no soul. You are not born with a soul -- the </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">soul has to be created by great effort. And only very rare people have been able to </div>

<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">Now, can you create a greater shock? -- just telling people, "You are soulless. There is </div>

<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">body, a mechanism. Yes, you have a possibility, a potentiality to become a soul, but </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">then you have to do much work for it, great work for it, and only then is it possible to </div>
