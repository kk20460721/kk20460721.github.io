<div id="t1_402" class="t s1_402">absolutely right, they will not say something which is only approximately true, because the</div>
<div id="t2_402" class="t s1_402">approximately true is nothing but a lie. They will not give an example because there is no</div>
<div id="t3_402" class="t s1_402">parallel to their experience, there is no possibility of any comparison. Seeing the situation, one</div>
<div id="t4_402" class="t s1_402">can understand why they have chosen to remain silent.</div>
<div id="t5_402" class="t s1_402">But there has been another category of awakened people, enlightened ones, who have</div>
<div id="t6_402" class="t s1_402">tried, although their efforts have not been very successful. By their very nature, they cannot</div>
<div id="t7_402" class="t s1_402">be. But even if one person in a million has become awakened by the efforts of a bodhisattva,</div>
<div id="t8_402" class="t s1_402">the second category of enlightened people, the effort was worth making.</div>
<div id="t9_402" class="t s1_402">The arhatas also have an answer for this. They say that if one man in a million becomes</div>
<div id="ta_402" class="t s1_402">awakened by listening to a bodhisattva, that man was destined to become enlightened whether</div>
<div id="tb_402" class="t s1_402">the bodhisattva had spoken or not.</div>
<div id="tc_402" class="t s1_402">I have been in a dilemma. You cannot deny what the arhatas are saying. They are saying</div>
<div id="td_402" class="t s1_402">the man has not become awakened from listening to you, because whatever you are saying is</div>
<div id="te_402" class="t s1_402">just a hint, far away; it cannot make anyone enlightened. And they have a certain reason for</div>
<div id="tf_402" class="t s1_402">saying it, because people have become enlightened sitting by their side in silence, too.</div>
<div id="tg_402" class="t s1_402">Nothing has been said, nothing has been indicated, but just the presence of the arhata, his</div>
<div id="th_402" class="t s1_402">silence, his peace, have proved contagious. Anyone who is receptive, available, open, has felt</div>
<div id="ti_402" class="t s1_402">something which was not said, and has moved on the path. Not only has he moved ... many</div>
<div id="tj_402" class="t s1_402">have reached to the ultimate.</div>
<div id="tk_402" class="t s1_402">Hence the arhata has also a reason for saying that there is no need to say anything. Those</div>
<div id="tl_402" class="t s1_402">who can understand will understand even your silence, and those who cannot understand are</div>
<div id="tm_402" class="t s1_402">not going to understand; you may go on for years and years speaking to them, and they will</div>
<div id="tn_402" class="t s1_402">remain deaf. You may talk about light, but they will not open their eyes. You may try to excite</div>
<div id="to_402" class="t s1_402">them about the beauties of the ultimate, but they will go on postponing the journey.</div>
<div id="tp_402" class="t s1_402">But the bodhisattva has his own reasoning -- and perhaps both are right. The bodhisattva</div>
<div id="tq_402" class="t s1_402">says that there are people who are just on the verge: just a little push and they may be</div>
<div id="tr_402" class="t s1_402">transformed; just a little indication -- a finger pointing to the moon -- and they may be able to</div>
<div id="ts_402" class="t s1_402">see. And anyway, even if nobody understands, it is still worthwhile to make the effort; at least</div>
<div id="tt_402" class="t s1_402">it shows your compassion, at least it shows you are not unconcerned with the vast humanity</div>
<div id="tu_402" class="t s1_402">which is groping in darkness. You have done whatever is humanly possible to do. If nobody</div>
<div id="tv_402" class="t s1_402">hears it, if nobody listens to it, it is up to them -- but they cannot blame you. They cannot</div>
<div id="tw_402" class="t s1_402">complain that you knew and yet you remained silent, that you should have made some effort</div>
<div id="tx_402" class="t s1_402">to wake them up.</div>
<div id="ty_402" class="t s1_402">These two categories have been in conflict for centuries, and both have been so clear about</div>
<div id="tz_402" class="t s1_402">their approach that not even a single arhata has been converted by the bodhisattvas, or</div>
<div id="t10_402" class="t s1_402">vice-versa: not a single bodhisattva has been converted by the arhatas.</div>
<div id="t11_402" class="t s1_402">My own understanding is that this conversion has not happened because both have</div>
<div id="t12_402" class="t s1_402">something absolutely true about their approach. One is committed to the truth absolutely; one</div>
<div id="t13_402" class="t s1_402">is committed to love, to compassion absolutely. And both values, truth and love, are of equal</div>
<div id="t14_402" class="t s1_402">significance.</div>
<div id="t15_402" class="t s1_402">I think there is no need for any arhata to become a bodhisattva, or any bodhisattva to</div>
<div id="t16_402" class="t s1_402">become an arhata. Perhaps both are needed. Perhaps people are needed to sing songs of that</div>
<div id="t17_402" class="t s1_402">which cannot be said, and people are needed to remain silent, so silent that their silence itself</div>
<div id="t18_402" class="t s1_402">becomes a magnetic force. Perhaps both have done immense service to humanity, the one by</div>
<div id="t19_402" class="t s1_402">Chapter 36 - Compassion</div>
<div id="t1a_402" class="t s1_402">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
