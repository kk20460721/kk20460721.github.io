<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">dropping sexuality. Nobody has ever been heard to die by becoming celibate. </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">You can live perfectly well. Only if you drop food you will die -- within three </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">months, at the most you can survive three months if you are perfectly healthy, </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">then you will die. Dropping food will be death to you. Dropping sex has nothing </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">to do with you. Maybe your children will never be born; that will be a death to </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">them -- death before they are even born -- but not death to you. </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">Through sex the race survives; through food, the individual. So the body is </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">concerned only with food. This body is concerned only with food, but your mind </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">is concerned with sex -- because only through sex, the mind thinks, will it have a </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">sort of immortality. You will die, that seems certain. You cannot deceive -- </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">everybody some day is dying. And every time the bell tolls it tolls for thee. Every </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">time death happens, you become shaken: your own death is coming close by. It </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">WILL come. It is only a question of time, but it is to come; there is no way to </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">escape from it. And wherever you escape to, you will find it waiting for you. </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">I have heard a very famous story, a Sufi story: </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">A king dreamt. In the night in his dream he saw Death. He became afraid. He </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">asked, "What is the matter? Why are you making me so frightened?" </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">Death said, "I have come to tell you that tomorrow by sunset I am coming, so get </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">ready. It is just out of compassion so that you can prepare." </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">The king was so shocked, his sleep was broken. It was the middle of the night; he </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">called his ministers and he said, "Find people who can interpret the dream, </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">because time is short. Maybe it is true!" </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">Then the interpreters came, but as interpreters always have been, they were great </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">scholars. They brought many big books and they started discussing and </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">disputing and arguing. And the sun started rising, and it was morning. And an </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">old man who was a very trusted servant to the king, he came to the king and he </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">whispered in his ear, "Don't be foolish! These people will quarrel for ever and </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">ever, and they will never come to any conclusion." </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">Now, everybody was trying that HIS interpretation was right, and the king was </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">more confused than ever. So he asked the old man, "Then what am I supposed to </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">do?" </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">He said, "Let them continue their discussions. They are not going to conclude so </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">soon -- and the sun will be setting, because once it has risen the sunset is not very </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">far. Rather, take my advice and escape -- at least escape from this palace. Be </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">somewhere else! By the evening reach somewhere as far away as possible." </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">The logic looked right. The king had a very fast horse, the fastest in the world. </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">He rushed, he escaped. Hundreds of miles he passed. By the time he reached a </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">certain town the sun was just about to set. He was very happy. He patted his </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">horse and he said, "You did well. We have come very far." </div>
