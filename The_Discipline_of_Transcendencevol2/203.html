<div id="t2_203" class="t s1_203">....</div>
<div id="t3_203" class="t s1_203">And every morning you say it was unreal, and again in the night </div>
<div id="t4_203" class="t s1_203">when you dream, dream becomes real. </div>
<div id="t5_203" class="t s1_203">In a dream it is so difficult to remember that this is a dream. But in the morning it </div>
<div id="t6_203" class="t s1_203">is so easy. What happens? You are the same person. In the dream there is only </div>
<div id="t7_203" class="t s1_203">one reality. How to compare? How to say it is unreal? Compared to what? It is </div>
<div id="t8_203" class="t s1_203">the only reality. Everything is as unreal as everything else so there is no </div>
<div id="t9_203" class="t s1_203">comparison. In the morning when you open your eyes another reality is there. </div>
<div id="ta_203" class="t s1_203">Now you can say it was all unreal. Compared to this reality, dream becomes </div>
<div id="tb_203" class="t s1_203">unreal. </div>
<div id="tc_203" class="t s1_203">There is an awakening -- compared to THAT reality of THAT awakening, this </div>
<div id="td_203" class="t s1_203">whole reality becomes unreal. </div>
<div id="te_203" class="t s1_203">That night for the first time I understood the meaning of the word maya. Not </div>
<div id="tf_203" class="t s1_203">that I had not known the word before, not that I was not aware of the meaning of </div>
<div id="tg_203" class="t s1_203">the word. As you are aware, I was also aware of the meaning -- but I had never </div>
<div id="th_203" class="t s1_203">understood it before. How can you understand without experience? </div>
<div id="ti_203" class="t s1_203">That night another reality opened its door, another dimension became available. </div>
<div id="tj_203" class="t s1_203">Suddenly it was there, the other reality, the separate reality, the really real, or </div>
<div id="tk_203" class="t s1_203">whatsoever you want to call it -- call it god, call it truth, call it dhamma, call it </div>
<div id="tl_203" class="t s1_203">tao, or whatsoever you will. It was nameless. But it was there -- so opaque, so </div>
<div id="tm_203" class="t s1_203">transparent, and yet so solid one could have touched it. It was almost suffocating </div>
<div id="tn_203" class="t s1_203">me in that room. It was too much and I was not yet capable of absorbing it. </div>
<div id="to_203" class="t s1_203">A deep urge arose in me to rush out of the room, to go under the sky -- it was </div>
<div id="tp_203" class="t s1_203">suffocating me. It was too much! It will kill me! If I had remained a few moments </div>
<div id="tq_203" class="t s1_203">more, it would have suffocated me -- it looked like that. </div>
<div id="tr_203" class="t s1_203">I rushed out of the room, came out in the street. A great urge was there just to be </div>
<div id="ts_203" class="t s1_203">under the sky with the stars, with the trees, with the earth... to be with nature. </div>
<div id="tt_203" class="t s1_203">And immediately as I came out, the feeling of being suffocated disappeared. It </div>
<div id="tu_203" class="t s1_203">was too small a place for such a big phenomenon. Even the sky is a small place </div>
<div id="tv_203" class="t s1_203">for that big phenomenon. It is bigger than the sky. Even the sky is not the limit </div>
<div id="tw_203" class="t s1_203">for it. But then I felt more at ease. </div>
<div id="tx_203" class="t s1_203">I walked towards the nearest garden. It was a totally new walk, as if gravitation </div>
<div id="ty_203" class="t s1_203">had disappeared. I was walking, or I was running, or I was simply flying; it was </div>
<div id="tz_203" class="t s1_203">difficult to decide. There was no gravitation, I was feeling weightless -- as if some </div>
<div id="t10_203" class="t s1_203">energy was taking me. I was in the hands of some other energy. </div>
<div id="t11_203" class="t s1_203">For the first time I was not alone, for the first time I was no more an individual, </div>
<div id="t12_203" class="t s1_203">for the first time the drop has come and fallen into the ocean. Now the whole </div>
<div id="t13_203" class="t s1_203">ocean was mine, I was the ocean. There was no limitation. A tremendous power </div>
<div id="t14_203" class="t s1_203">arose as if I could do anything whatsoever. I was not there, only the power was </div>
<div id="t15_203" class="t s1_203">there. </div>
<div id="t16_203" class="t s1_203">I reached to the garden where I used to go every day. The garden was closed, </div>
<div id="t17_203" class="t s1_203">closed for the night. It was too late, it was almost one o'clock in the night. The </div>
<div id="t18_203" class="t s1_203">gardeners were fast asleep. I had to enter the garden like a thief, I had to climb </div>
