<div id="t1_297" class="t s1_297">CHAPTER 19. MAN: THE GREATEST PROBLEM – AND THE ONLY SOLUTION</div>
<div id="t2_297" class="t s2_297">of strong arms; and he was really a giant of a man. He was the son of a king, and the king became</div>
<div id="t3_297" class="t s2_297">a monk. The king’s eldest son’s name was Bharat, and because of this man’s name, India’s oldest</div>
<div id="t4_297" class="t s2_297">name is Bharat, the land of Bharat.</div>
<div id="t5_297" class="t s2_297">Bharat was the eldest son and Bahubali was the youngest son – there were only two sons. Bharat</div>
<div id="t6_297" class="t s2_297">was conventionally the inheritor of the kingdom. When the father became a monk and renounced</div>
<div id="t7_297" class="t s2_297">the world, he did not proclaim who the successor was. When he was asked, he said, ”How can I do</div>
<div id="t8_297" class="t s2_297">that? A thing which I am renouncing... how can I proclaim one of my own sons to be the inheritor of</div>
<div id="t9_297" class="t s2_297">something that I have rejected? It is for them: if they want it, it is there; I am not taking it away.</div>
<div id="ta_297" class="t s2_297">”But people will laugh at me: ’If you found it so useless that you simply kicked it out of your way...</div>
<div id="tb_297" class="t s2_297">you must have some deep greed, some attachment if you still want your eldest son to become the</div>
<div id="tc_297" class="t s2_297">king.” He said, ”The kingdom is just worthless – nobody needs to inherit it. If they want to, that is</div>
<div id="td_297" class="t s2_297">their business.”</div>
<div id="te_297" class="t s2_297">Bharat, seeing that his father thought that the kingdom was not even worth his declaring somebody</div>
<div id="tf_297" class="t s2_297">a successor, followed his father. Bahubali was very much interested in the kingdom; he was a very</div>
<div id="tg_297" class="t s2_297">worldly man. And he was a great warrior. He knew perfectly well that Bharat was going to be the</div>
<div id="th_297" class="t s2_297">owner of the kingdom; his chances of being a king were nil. But he could shine in other ﬁelds, and</div>
<div id="ti_297" class="t s2_297">the best one was to be the greatest warrior in the country. And of course Bharat was no match for</div>
<div id="tj_297" class="t s2_297">him – Bharat was a simple man.</div>
<div id="tk_297" class="t s2_297">Bahubali prepared himself to be the greatest warrior. But there was trouble, and the trouble was that</div>
<div id="tl_297" class="t s2_297">Bharat had not renounced the world for the simple reason that there was nothing to renounce; the</div>
<div id="tm_297" class="t s2_297">father had not given him any inheritance. It is a beautiful story. The father had not given him any</div>
<div id="tn_297" class="t s2_297">inheritance, thinking it was useless. So what had he got to renounce? – he was already in a state</div>
<div id="to_297" class="t s2_297">of renunciation.</div>
<div id="tp_297" class="t s2_297">But a formal declaration from Bharat was needed saying that he had renounced the kingdom; only</div>
<div id="tq_297" class="t s2_297">then could Bahubali succeed.</div>
<div id="tr_297" class="t s2_297">If he did not make a formal declaration...</div>
<div id="ts_297" class="t s2_297">and he was not willing</div>
<div id="tt_297" class="t s2_297">to because, he said, ”If I have not succeeded to it in the very ﬁrst place, I don’t own it; how can I</div>
<div id="tu_297" class="t s2_297">renounce somebody else’s property?”</div>
<div id="tv_297" class="t s2_297">One year passed, and Bahubali was getting more and more agitated because this was a very strange</div>
<div id="tw_297" class="t s2_297">situation. The father had left, the elder brother was meditating in the mountains, and the younger</div>
<div id="tx_297" class="t s2_297">brother was in a limbo. He could not declare himself the king; for that Bharat had to renounce it</div>
<div id="ty_297" class="t s2_297">formally. At least he should say, ”I am no longer interested,” but he had gone into silence and was</div>
<div id="tz_297" class="t s2_297">simply meditating.</div>
<div id="t10_297" class="t s2_297">Bahubali went there, very angry; and he was a man of tremendous power. He took Bharat up in</div>
<div id="t11_297" class="t s2_297">his hands and was going to throw him down into the valley; even pieces of his body would not have</div>
<div id="t12_297" class="t s2_297">been found. But just as he was holding him up in his hands a thought arose: ”What am I doing?</div>
<div id="t13_297" class="t s2_297">And for what? That kingdom, my father has renounced; after his whole life’s experience he found it</div>
<div id="t14_297" class="t s2_297">worthless.</div>
<div id="t15_297" class="t s2_297">”My brother loves me immensely, so much that if I had asked him to make me the successor, he</div>
<div id="t16_297" class="t s2_297">would have crowned me himself. But he is also right because he is no one. And even here, while</div>
