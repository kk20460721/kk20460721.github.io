<div id="t1_301" class="t s1_301">CHAPTER 27. LOVE: THE CONSCIOUS PATH OF THE EGO</div>
<div id="t2_301" class="t s2_301">It is simply a defense mechanism. They are trying to tell the whole world why they have left me –</div>
<div id="t3_301" class="t s2_301">because I am not what they used to think. Still they are unaware that it is not my problem that they</div>
<div id="t4_301" class="t s2_301">have left, it does not matter to me. Thousands of people have come and gone; I don’t know even</div>
<div id="t5_301" class="t s2_301">their names. While they are here on my surgery table I do whatever I can do, but a few idiots escape</div>
<div id="t6_301" class="t s2_301">while the surgery is only half done.</div>
<div id="t7_301" class="t s2_301">I have heard about a politician. He had gone to a great surgeon, a brain surgeon. The politician was</div>
<div id="t8_301" class="t s2_301">very important and he was contesting for the presidency of the country, so the brain surgeon had</div>
<div id="t9_301" class="t s2_301">called all his colleagues and told them to be very careful. But they saw so much crap in his brain</div>
<div id="ta_301" class="t s2_301">that they ﬁnally thought that it was better to put him in a coma and take out the whole brain and give</div>
<div id="tb_301" class="t s2_301">it a dry cleaning.</div>
<div id="tc_301" class="t s2_301">While they were cleaning his brain in another room, the man came to a little, and at that very moment</div>
<div id="td_301" class="t s2_301">one man came in and said, ”What are you doing lying here? You have been chosen the president of</div>
<div id="te_301" class="t s2_301">the country!”</div>
<div id="tf_301" class="t s2_301">So he jumped off the table. The surgeons saw that he was jumping off the table and they could not</div>
<div id="tg_301" class="t s2_301">believe it; they said, ”Wait, your brain is being washed!”</div>
<div id="th_301" class="t s2_301">The politician said, ”For ﬁve years at least I will not need it. You can keep it and clean it completely.</div>
<div id="ti_301" class="t s2_301">I have become the president of the country; what do I need the brain for?”</div>
<div id="tj_301" class="t s2_301">Shiva used to be sitting by my side every evening in darshan. He was a guard – not my bodyguard,</div>
<div id="tk_301" class="t s2_301">just one of the guards – and his function here was that when people in darshan sometimes fell down,</div>
<div id="tl_301" class="t s2_301">if they felt such an upsurge of energy that they could not manage to sit, his function was to take them</div>
<div id="tm_301" class="t s2_301">back to their seats or take them and make them lie down by the side.</div>
<div id="tn_301" class="t s2_301">I had never seen anything that could be called intelligent in him. He never wrote a single word, he</div>
<div id="to_301" class="t s2_301">never wrote any book about his experiences here. Perhaps he was so insensitive that although he</div>
<div id="tp_301" class="t s2_301">was amidst tremendous experiences happening, his insensitivity did not allow him to be aware of it.</div>
<div id="tq_301" class="t s2_301">The day I left for America he followed me. Certainly in America there was a different arrangement;</div>
<div id="tr_301" class="t s2_301">the whole commune was a different kind of functioning organization, and he was not chosen to be a</div>
<div id="ts_301" class="t s2_301">guard. He came twice, but I was in silence and isolation so he could not approach me.</div>
<div id="tt_301" class="t s2_301">The others who were in the ofﬁce said, ”We don’t need you as a guard because we have been</div>
<div id="tu_301" class="t s2_301">conﬁrmed by the American government as a city. We have a police department so now guards are</div>
<div id="tv_301" class="t s2_301">not needed.”</div>
<div id="tw_301" class="t s2_301">Of course we did not allow any non-sannyasin to be in the police department. We sent our own</div>
<div id="tx_301" class="t s2_301">people for the training; our own people were the policemen, so there was no need for guards. Those</div>
<div id="ty_301" class="t s2_301">policemen were functioning under the chief of police of Oregon.</div>
<div id="tz_301" class="t s2_301">Shiva was so much hurt because his power had been taken away that he wrote a book, BHAGWAN,</div>
<div id="t10_301" class="t s2_301">THE GOD THAT FAILED. If he had been authentic and true he should have written, SHIVA, THE</div>
<div id="t11_301" class="t s2_301">GUARD THAT FAILED. But nobody looks at himself; people always project on others.</div>
<div id="t12_301" class="t s2_301">Satyam Shivam Sundram</div>
<div id="t13_301" class="t s2_301">301</div>
<div id="t14_301" class="t s3_301">Osho</div>
