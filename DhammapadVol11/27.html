<div id="t7_27" class="t s1_27">could have missed him. But they were missing him! Even his own father could not </div>
<div id="t8_27" class="t s1_27">recognize that he was enlightened; even his own wife could not recognize that he was </div>
<div id="t9_27" class="t s1_27">enlightened. There were only a few people who had the courage to recognize him -- </div>
<div id="ta_27" class="t s1_27">because to recognize him means you have to change your life-style, to recognize him </div>
<div id="tb_27" class="t s1_27">means you can't remain the same anymore. To recognize a buddha as a buddha means </div>
