<div id="t1_5" class="t s1_5">Only the newcomers were a little at a loss -- they could not comprehend what was </div>
<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">going on. But I feel thankful to them too. Although they could not understand what was </div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">going on, they waited -- they were waiting for me to speak, they were waiting for me to </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">say something, they were hoping. Many were afraid that I might not speak ever </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">again...that was also a possibility. I was not certain myself. </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">Words are becoming more and more difficult for me. They are becoming more and </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">more of an effort. I have to say something so I go on saying something to you. But I </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">would like you to get ready as soon as possible so that we can simply sit in </div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">silence...listening to the birds and their songs...or listening just to your own </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">heartbeat...just being here, doing nothing</div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">....</div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">Get ready as soon as possible, because I may stop speaking any day. And let the news </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">be spread to all the nooks and corners of the world: those who want to understand me </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">only through the words, they should come soon, because I may stop speaking any day. </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">Unpredictably, any day, it may happen -- it may happen even in the middle of a </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">sentence. Then I am not going to complete the sentence! Then it will hang forever and </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">forever...incomplete. </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">But this time you have pulled me back. </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">These sayings of Buddha are called THE DHAMMAPADA. This name has to be </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">understood. Dhamma means many things. It means the ultimate law, logos. By </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">"ultimate law" is meant that which keeps the whole universe together. Invisible it is, </div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">intangible it is -- but it is certainly; otherwise the universe would fall apart. Such a vast, </div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">infinite universe, running so smoothly, so harmoniously, is enough proof that there </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">must be an undercurrent that connects everything, that joins everything, that bridges </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">everything -- that we are not islands, that the smallest grass leaf is joined to the greatest </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">star. Destroy a small grass leaf and you have destroyed something of immense value to </div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">the existence itself. </div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">In existence there is no hierarchy, there is nothing small and nothing great. The greatest </div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">star and the smallest grass leaf, both exist as equals; hence the other meaning of the </div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">word 'dhamma'. The other meaning is justice, the equality, the nonhierarchic existence. </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">Existence is absolutely communist; it knows no classes, it is all one. Hence the other </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">meaning of the word 'dhamma' -- justice. </div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s1_5">And the third meaning is righteousness, virtue. Existence is very virtuous. Even if you </div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s1_5">find something which you cannot call virtue, it must be because of your </div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s1_5">misunderstanding; otherwise the existence is absolutely virtuous. Whatsoever happens </div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">here, always happens rightly. The wrong never happens. It may appear wrong to you </div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">because you have a certain idea of what right is, but when you look without any </div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">prejudice, nothing is wrong, all is right. Birth is right, death is right. Beauty is right and </div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s1_5">ugliness is right. </div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s1_5">But our minds are small, our comprehension is limited; we cannot see the whole, we </div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s1_5">always see only a small part. We are like a person who is hiding behind his door and </div>
<div id="t16_5" class="t s1_5">looking through the keyhole into the street. He always sees things...yes, somebody is </div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s1_5">moving, a car suddenly passes by. One moment it was not there, one moment it is there, </div>
<div id="t18_5" class="t s1_5">and another moment it is gone forever. That's how we are looking at existence. We say </div>
