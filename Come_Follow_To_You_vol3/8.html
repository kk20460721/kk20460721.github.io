<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">become the foe and you start destroying him. Because his very presence is </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">offensive, he has to be destroyed. </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">When Jesus was crucified, a great weight disappeared from the Jewish mind. </div>

<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">somebody who was a constant reminder that you were empty, hollow within, </div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">that you were not fulfilled. Contemporaries cannot understand. Very rare </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">people, rare because they can drop their egos, can see what Jesus is. And even </div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s1_8">their vision is always shaking, even their vision is not very certain, even their </div>

<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">That was always a practice with him that whenever he would move into the </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">multitudes, into the crowd, afterwards he would go alone into deep prayer and </div>

<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">meditating, a very fragile quality, a very delicate quality of consciousness is born </div>

<div id="tw_8" class="t s1_8">aloneness, it is a loneliness; you miss the other. You don't find yourself in it, you </div>
<div id="tx_8" class="t s1_8">simply miss the other. When you are alone, you are not alone, because you are </div>
<div id="ty_8" class="t s1_8">not there. Only that desire to be with others is there -- that is what loneliness is. </div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s1_8">Always remember the distinction between aloneness and loneliness. Aloneness is </div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">a peak of experience. Loneliness is a valley. Aloneness has light in it, a flame. </div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s1_8">Loneliness is dark and damp. Loneliness is when you desire others; aloneness is </div>
