<div id="t2_67" class="t s1_67">He has four, you are disturbing. You are disturbing his knowledge. He is not </div>
<div id="t3_67" class="t s1_67">worried about God; who is worried about God? But he is worried about it. He </div>
<div id="t4_67" class="t s1_67">has settled himself, he was feeling secure in his knowledge, he was feeling that </div>
<div id="t5_67" class="t s1_67">he was in the know. Now here you come and you say,. "No, God has four faces." </div>
<div id="t6_67" class="t s1_67">Now you create an anxiety in him, again the same anxiety that was there before </div>
<div id="t7_67" class="t s1_67">he had decided. That's why one religion does not want to listen to another </div>
<div id="t8_67" class="t s1_67">religion's ideas -- because it creates anxiety. It creates a great turmoil, it creates a </div>
<div id="t9_67" class="t s1_67">great chaos. </div>
<div id="ta_67" class="t s1_67">People want to remain fixed in their ideas; nobody should disturb them. But this </div>
<div id="tb_67" class="t s1_67">is not knowledge. This is what belief is. Belief means: you cannot recognize the </div>
<div id="tc_67" class="t s1_67">fact that you don't know. You are not courageous enough to recognize that you </div>
<div id="td_67" class="t s1_67">are ignorant. Cowards carry many beliefs with them, so there is no need to </div>
<div id="te_67" class="t s1_67">recognize the fact of ignorance. But ignorance is more beautiful than false </div>
<div id="tf_67" class="t s1_67">knowledge; at least it is true, authentic. If a person says, "I don't know," to me, he </div>
<div id="tg_67" class="t s1_67">is the beginning of a religious consciousness. He is at the door. The person who </div>
<div id="th_67" class="t s1_67">says, "I know," and if you say anything against him he gets disturbed and is </div>
<div id="ti_67" class="t s1_67">worried and starts protecting and defending himself, then it seems that his </div>
<div id="tj_67" class="t s1_67">knowledge is just a security measure. He has just created a make-believe around </div>
<div id="tk_67" class="t s1_67">him. He had been living in his dream, and you come and you disturb the dream. </div>
<div id="tl_67" class="t s1_67">You cannot disturb a man of knowing -- because a man of knowing knows that </div>
<div id="tm_67" class="t s1_67">the ultimate cannot be known. You can have a taste of it, but you can never </div>
<div id="tn_67" class="t s1_67">formulate it. The ultimate remains a mystery; mystery is its very nature. There is </div>
<div id="to_67" class="t s1_67">no way to dissolve the mystery. He knows his ignorance, he knows the ultimate </div>
<div id="tp_67" class="t s1_67">mystery. And the ultimate mystery and the seeker's ignorance meet with each </div>
<div id="tq_67" class="t s1_67">other, and there is a great communion. </div>
<div id="tr_67" class="t s1_67">When the person of knowledge goes to truth, he never listens to truth -- because </div>
<div id="ts_67" class="t s1_67">truth is also disturbing. He has his belief: the truth has to follow his belief. The </div>
<div id="tt_67" class="t s1_67">truth has to come in the form of his belief; only then can he recognize. </div>
<div id="tu_67" class="t s1_67">It is said about Tulsidas, a great Hindu poet -- I will not call him a great Hindu </div>
<div id="tv_67" class="t s1_67">saint, but he was REALLY a great poet</div>
<div id="tw_67" class="t s1_67">....</div>
<div id="tx_67" class="t s1_67">He was taken to a temple of Krishna's Mathura. He was a follower of Ram. A </div>
<div id="ty_67" class="t s1_67">person took him to this beautiful temple, and Krishna's statue was there with a </div>
<div id="tz_67" class="t s1_67">flute on his lips. But Tulsidas would not bow down. The friends asked, "Why? </div>
<div id="t10_67" class="t s1_67">Why don't you bow down?" He said, "I cannot. I can bow down only to Rama. </div>
<div id="t11_67" class="t s1_67">If," he said to Krishna's statue, "if you want me to bow down to you, then you </div>
<div id="t12_67" class="t s1_67">will have to become Ram. Change your form, and rather than the flute take a </div>
<div id="t13_67" class="t s1_67">bow, as Rama carries a bow." The story says that Krishna transformed his form. </div>
<div id="t14_67" class="t s1_67">He became Ram with a bow on his shoulder. And then Tulsidas bowed down. </div>
<div id="t15_67" class="t s1_67">The story must be fiction, but it is very symbolic: a person who has a belief </div>
<div id="t16_67" class="t s1_67">would always like to force truth to come according to his belief, according to his </div>
<div id="t17_67" class="t s1_67">channel. But truth never comes according to you. So half the story seems to be </div>
<div id="t18_67" class="t s1_67">true and the other half seems to be fiction. It seems to be true that Tulsidas said </div>
