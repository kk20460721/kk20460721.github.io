<div id="t1_86" class="t s1_86">One of the mystics of India, Kabir, sings a song, JYON KI TYON DHAR DINHI </div>
<div id="t2_86" class="t s1_86">CHADARIYA. "I have returned to God" or to existence, "the clothing that he had </div>
<div id="t3_86" class="t s1_86">given to me to live in the world -- without any change. I have not made it dirty; </div>
<div id="t4_86" class="t s1_86">not even a particle of dust has gathered on it. I have put it back into his hands </div>
<div id="t5_86" class="t s1_86">exactly as fresh as it was when he gave it to me." This is the experience of an </div>
<div id="t6_86" class="t s1_86">awakened man. He lives in the darkest nights in the same silence, in the same </div>
<div id="t7_86" class="t s1_86">peace, as he lives in the brightest day. He never makes the division. He remains </div>
<div id="t8_86" class="t s1_86">always transcendental, he remains always above any divisions. Divisions are left </div>
<div id="t9_86" class="t s1_86">far behind. </div>
<div id="ta_86" class="t s1_86">SUCH IS HIS POWER, ACTIONS CAN'T HOLD HIM. NO MATTER WHAT </div>
<div id="tb_86" class="t s1_86">KIND OF ACTION, A BUDDHA TRANSFORMS IT. </div>
<div id="tc_86" class="t s1_86">This statement has to be taken deep into your heart </div>
<div id="td_86" class="t s1_86">....</div>
<div id="te_86" class="t s1_86">You have heard the story in Greek mythology of King Midas, who had been </div>
<div id="tf_86" class="t s1_86">praying his whole life to God: "Just grant me one wish, that whatever I touch </div>
<div id="tg_86" class="t s1_86">must turn into gold." And it seems God became tired of his continuous nagging </div>
<div id="th_86" class="t s1_86">...because what are your prayers other than nagging? </div>
<div id="ti_86" class="t s1_86">And a poor God, and so many nagging people, and he has been nagged for </div>
<div id="tj_86" class="t s1_86">millions of years -- it is no wonder if he has disappeared or committed suicide or </div>
<div id="tk_86" class="t s1_86">whatever has happened. Nobody can tolerate that much nagging. </div>
<div id="tl_86" class="t s1_86">Finally, God granted him the wish -- "Whatever you touch will turn into gold. </div>
<div id="tm_86" class="t s1_86">And now leave me at peace!" </div>
<div id="tn_86" class="t s1_86">But the unconscious man cannot do anything better. Friedrich Nietzsche is right </div>
<div id="to_86" class="t s1_86">when he says that if all your prayers were fulfilled, you would be in utter hell. </div>
<div id="tp_86" class="t s1_86">Your prayers are coming from your unconsciousness; you don't know what you </div>
<div id="tq_86" class="t s1_86">are asking for. It is good that God is deaf and no prayer is ever answered; </div>
<div id="tr_86" class="t s1_86">otherwise you would repent ..."Why have I prayed ...?" </div>
<div id="ts_86" class="t s1_86">And this was the situation with King Midas. He had never thought of all the </div>
<div id="tt_86" class="t s1_86">implications of his whole lifelong prayer. Morning and evening he went on </div>
<div id="tu_86" class="t s1_86">praying only for one thing: "I don't want anything else. Just a simple thing -- </div>
<div id="tv_86" class="t s1_86">whatever I touch should be transformed into gold." </div>
<div id="tw_86" class="t s1_86">But as the prayer was granted he became aware of its implications. He could not </div>
<div id="tx_86" class="t s1_86">eat because whatever he touched turned into gold. He could not drink because </div>
<div id="ty_86" class="t s1_86">by the time his lips touched the water, it would turn into gold. His wife escaped, </div>
<div id="tz_86" class="t s1_86">his children left him, his friends stopped coming to see him. Even his servants </div>
<div id="t10_86" class="t s1_86">remained alert. All his great courtiers forgot to come to his court. He used to sit </div>
<div id="t11_86" class="t s1_86">alone -- hungry, thirsty, but it was now too late. It took his whole life to pray to </div>
<div id="t12_86" class="t s1_86">get the wish. Now to get it canceled would take a whole life again! </div>
<div id="t13_86" class="t s1_86">He started praying but nothing happened. He died from starvation, and he killed </div>
<div id="t14_86" class="t s1_86">a few people by touching them. He certainly made a gold palace by touching his </div>
<div id="t15_86" class="t s1_86">house; all his furniture became gold -- but what is the purpose of it? He suffered </div>
<div id="t16_86" class="t s1_86">so badly as perhaps nobody has ever suffered, and he was one of the richest men </div>
<div id="t17_86" class="t s1_86">in the world. </div>
