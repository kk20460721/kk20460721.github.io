<div id="t1_135" class="t s1_135">At the point of expression, yoga divides reality in two: purusha and prakriti. Prakriti </div>
<div id="t2_135" class="t s1_135">means "matter"; purusha means "consciousness." Now when you are identified with the </div>
<div id="t3_135" class="t s1_135">bodymind, with prakriti, with nature, with matter; both are polluted. Pollution is always </div>
<div id="t4_135" class="t s1_135">double. </div>
<div id="t5_135" class="t s1_135">For example, if you mix water and milk, you say, "The milk is no longer pure," but you </div>
<div id="t6_135" class="t s1_135">have not observed anything: the water is also no longer pure. Because water is free so </div>
<div id="t7_135" class="t s1_135">nobody is worried, that is one thing; but when you mix water and milk, both become </div>
<div id="t8_135" class="t s1_135">impure. This is something, because both were pure -- water was water, milk was milk -- </div>
<div id="t9_135" class="t s1_135">both were pure. This is a miracle. Two purities meet, and both become impure. </div>
<div id="ta_135" class="t s1_135">Impurity has nothing condemnatory in it. It simply says the foreign element has entered. </div>
<div id="tb_135" class="t s1_135">It simply says something which is not of its innermost nature has entered, that's all. </div>
<div id="tc_135" class="t s1_135">This sutra is very beautiful. "Vibhuti Pada" ends with this sutra; it is a culmination. This </div>
<div id="td_135" class="t s1_135">sutra says when you are identified with the body, you are impure, body is impure. When </div>
<div id="te_135" class="t s1_135">you are identified with the mind, you are impure, mind is impure. When you are not </div>
<div id="tf_135" class="t s1_135">identified, both become pure. </div>
<div id="tg_135" class="t s1_135">Now this will look like a paradox. A siddha, or a Buddha, one who has achieved, his </div>
<div id="th_135" class="t s1_135">mind functions in purity. His genius functions in purity; all his talents become pure. And </div>
<div id="ti_135" class="t s1_135">his consciousness functions in purity. Both are separated -- milk is milk, water is water. </div>
<div id="tj_135" class="t s1_135">Both have become pure again. </div>
<div id="tk_135" class="t s1_135">The sutra says, "Liberation is obtained when there is equality of purity between the </div>
<div id="tl_135" class="t s1_135">purusha and sattva." Sattva is the highest point of prakriti, nature, matter. Sattva means </div>
<div id="tm_135" class="t s1_135">the "intelligence"; and purusha means the "awareness." That is the most subtle tie inside </div>
<div id="tn_135" class="t s1_135">you because they are so similar. Intelligence and awareness are so similar that many </div>
<div id="to_135" class="t s1_135">times you may start thinking that an intelligent man is an aware man. It is not so. </div>
<div id="tp_135" class="t s1_135">Einstein is intelligent, tremendously intelligent, but he is not a Buddha, he is not aware. </div>
<div id="tq_135" class="t s1_135">He may even be more unaware than ordinary people because he will be inside his </div>
<div id="tr_135" class="t s1_135">intelligence so much. </div>
<div id="ts_135" class="t s1_135">It happened that Einstein was going to some place in a bus, and the conductor came and </div>
<div id="tt_135" class="t s1_135">asked for the money. He gave him the money. The conductor gave Einstein his change. </div>
<div id="tu_135" class="t s1_135">Einstein counted it but counted it wrongly -- the greatest mathematician of the world -- </div>
<div id="tv_135" class="t s1_135">and he said, "You have not given me the right change; give me a few more coins." </div>
<div id="tw_135" class="t s1_135">The conductor counted again; he said, "Don't you know figures?" </div>
<div id="tx_135" class="t s1_135">He was not aware that this was Albert Einstein. There has never been such a great </div>
<div id="ty_135" class="t s1_135">mathematical genius ever... and the conductor said, "Don't you know figures?" Nobody </div>
<div id="tz_135" class="t s1_135">has known anything more than this man about figures, but what happened? </div>
<div id="t10_135" class="t s1_135">People who are very intelligent almost always become absentminded. They are moved by </div>
<div id="t11_135" class="t s1_135">and attached to their intelligence so much that they become oblivious to many things in </div>
<div id="t12_135" class="t s1_135">the outside world. </div>
<div id="t13_135" class="t s1_135">I have heard about a great psychoanalyst, a very intelligent man. He was absorbed so </div>
<div id="t14_135" class="t s1_135">much in his experiments that for two or three days he didn't turn up home. The wife was </div>
<div id="t15_135" class="t s1_135">worried. The third day she could not wait anymore, so she phoned and she said, "What </div>
<div id="t16_135" class="t s1_135">are you doing? Come back; I am waiting for you. And supper is ready." </div>
<div id="t17_135" class="t s1_135">He said, "Okay, I will come. What is the address?" </div>
<div id="t18_135" class="t s1_135">He had forgotten completely -- his wife and the home and the address also. </div>
<div id="t19_135" class="t s1_135">Intelligence is not necessarily awareness. Awareness is necessarily intelligence! A man </div>
<div id="t1a_135" class="t s1_135">who is aware is intelligent, but a man who is intelligent need not be aware, there is no </div>
