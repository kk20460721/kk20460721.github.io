<div id="t2_113" class="t s1_113">smokes and goes on telling the child, "Never smoke. This is very bad, and you will </div>
<div id="t3_113" class="t s1_113">suffer." </div>
<div id="t4_113" class="t s1_113">Of course Adam had to cat it, but God is the culprit. He has to be because he is the </div>
<div id="t5_113" class="t s1_113">foundation of all. So if sin happens he has to be the criminal; if virtue happens he has to </div>
<div id="t6_113" class="t s1_113">be the cause of it. All is his. Deepest, you will always find him there. And he must be </div>
<div id="t7_113" class="t s1_113">laughing since then. </div>
<div id="t8_113" class="t s1_113">Adam could not understand; a little psychology was needed. It is not a religious question; </div>
<div id="t9_113" class="t s1_113">it is a psychological question. And even then God was not sitting silently and waiting, </div>
<div id="ta_113" class="t s1_113">because may be Adam may be very obedient and may not eat; so he had to make other </div>
<div id="tb_113" class="t s1_113">arrangements -- the snake. God must have felt that Adam seems to be too docile, </div>
<div id="tc_113" class="t s1_113">obedient, a good boy; so he had to bring in a girl, Eve, and a snake. The snake provokes </div>
<div id="td_113" class="t s1_113">Eve and Eve provokes Adam. Now the thing becomes simple. Adam can throw the </div>
<div id="te_113" class="t s1_113">responsibility on Eve, Eve can throw the responsibility on the snake. And of course </div>
<div id="tf_113" class="t s1_113">snakes don't speak they cannot write bibles and they cannot throw the responsibility on </div>
<div id="tg_113" class="t s1_113">God. But the responsibility is his. </div>
<div id="th_113" class="t s1_113">There is only one irreligion and that is to deny life, to deny love. And there is only one </div>
<div id="ti_113" class="t s1_113">religion: to accept it in its totality and to move in it unafraid. </div>
<div id="tj_113" class="t s1_113">So this attitude is harmful. </div>
<div id="tk_113" class="t s1_113">"How? Why? What for? -- nothing is clear." But why should it be clear? Why in the first </div>
<div id="tl_113" class="t s1_113">place do you want it to be dear? And if it is absolutely clear, the whole point will be lost, </div>
<div id="tm_113" class="t s1_113">the whole game will be lost. If everything is absolutely clear, then there is no alternative. </div>
<div id="tn_113" class="t s1_113">Then you cannot go astray. Then you will always do the right thing, if everything is </div>
<div id="to_113" class="t s1_113">absolutely dear. Then you cannot stumble, then you cannot move in the darkness and go </div>
<div id="tp_113" class="t s1_113">far away from God. </div>
<div id="tq_113" class="t s1_113">But he wants you to go far away because only when you have gone very, very far away </div>
<div id="tr_113" class="t s1_113">does a thirst arise to come back home. </div>
<div id="ts_113" class="t s1_113">In fact now modern psychology exactly says this: that every child has to go away from </div>
<div id="tt_113" class="t s1_113">the mother. First the child is in the womb, then one day he has to come out of the womb. </div>
<div id="tu_113" class="t s1_113">That is the beginning of going far away from the mother. Now he is no longer part of the </div>
<div id="tv_113" class="t s1_113">mother. Then the cord is cut; he starts functioning independently. But still he will cling to </div>
<div id="tw_113" class="t s1_113">the mother, to the breast, because she is his whole being, still -- out of the womb, but still </div>
<div id="tx_113" class="t s1_113">he will go on clinging to the mother, he will remain in the motherly atmosphere. But then </div>
<div id="ty_113" class="t s1_113">that too has to go. The child is growing. One day milk is stopped, the breast is taken </div>
<div id="tz_113" class="t s1_113">away, and the mother forces the child to become more independent. Now he has to </div>
<div id="t10_113" class="t s1_113">choose his own food and he has to chew his own food. Then still more -- he has to go to </div>
<div id="t11_113" class="t s1_113">the school or the boarding house. Then far away, far away he moves. Then one day he </div>
<div id="t12_113" class="t s1_113">falls in love with a woman; that is the last step. </div>
<div id="t13_113" class="t s1_113">That's why mothers can never forgive daughters-in-law. Impossible, because they are the </div>
<div id="t14_113" class="t s1_113">last straw -- they have taken their son completely. Now the son has become completely </div>
<div id="t15_113" class="t s1_113">independent. He has his own family; he has started his Own unit. Now he is no longer </div>
<div id="t16_113" class="t s1_113">attached to the mother. </div>
<div id="t17_113" class="t s1_113">Exactly the same thing is happening in the world of consciousness. Man has to go away </div>
<div id="t18_113" class="t s1_113">from the mother. And God is more a mother than a father, remember. Man is born out of </div>
<div id="t19_113" class="t s1_113">the womb of God, then he takes care. </div>
