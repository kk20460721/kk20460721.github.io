<div id="t1_140" class="t s1_140">CHAPTER 14. THE GREATEST SURGERY POSSIBLE</div>
<div id="t2_140" class="t s2_140">It was just by chance that the prime minister of France had read a few of his books and was</div>
<div id="t3_140" class="t s2_140">immensely impressed.</div>
<div id="t4_140" class="t s2_140">He invited him, and gave him a beautiful place near Paris, a few miles</div>
<div id="t5_140" class="t s2_140">away, where he established his commune.</div>
<div id="t6_140" class="t s2_140">In that commune there were two sections. One was the old-guard Russians who had come with him,</div>
<div id="t7_140" class="t s2_140">who were far more developed than the new followers from the West – particularly from America. The</div>
<div id="t8_140" class="t s2_140">difﬁculty was double.</div>
<div id="t9_140" class="t s2_140">First, the Russian group knew only Russian, so communication was impossible.</div>
<div id="ta_140" class="t s2_140">Second, they</div>
<div id="tb_140" class="t s2_140">were highly developed, and these new people were highly educated but spiritually not developed</div>
<div id="tc_140" class="t s2_140">at all. Those Russians were not very educated. So there was another barrier of communication –</div>
<div id="td_140" class="t s2_140">intellectually they could not communicate, language prevented it, education prevented it, and on the</div>
<div id="te_140" class="t s2_140">plane of being also, communication was difﬁcult because the Russian group was far more developed</div>
<div id="tf_140" class="t s2_140">– Gurdjieff had been working for years with them.</div>
<div id="tg_140" class="t s2_140">The oldest disciple was his own wife. And it became troublesome to people, particularly the new</div>
<div id="th_140" class="t s2_140">group: ”Why should Gurdjieff be so interested in his own wife?” It was not a question of being his</div>
<div id="ti_140" class="t s2_140">wife; that was irrelevant. The question was that he had worked on the woman the most, and she</div>
<div id="tj_140" class="t s2_140">was dying. And it was only a question of a few days – if he could manage to keep her alive her</div>
<div id="tk_140" class="t s2_140">crystallization will happen. Otherwise one knows not into how many circles of birth and death she</div>
<div id="tl_140" class="t s2_140">would have to move.</div>
<div id="tm_140" class="t s2_140">And he was capable of keeping her alive, because in his system, transfer of energy is one of the</div>
<div id="tn_140" class="t s2_140">basic methods. It can be used to the extreme – that the dying person can live as much as the person</div>
<div id="to_140" class="t s2_140">who is transmitting his energy to him; if he transmits his whole energy he will die immediately, and</div>
<div id="tp_140" class="t s2_140">the dying person can live long.</div>
<div id="tq_140" class="t s2_140">Gurdjieff was not trying to sacriﬁce anybody, but everybody could contribute a little bit of energy to</div>
<div id="tr_140" class="t s2_140">his wife. And it was only a question of a few more days of good health, so she can continue the</div>
<div id="ts_140" class="t s2_140">work. She had almost reached, just a step more and she would not be coming back.</div>
<div id="tt_140" class="t s2_140">But the Western group could not understand why he was so interested: a man who is enlightened</div>
<div id="tu_140" class="t s2_140">should look equally towards everybody – whether one is his wife or not. But they were ignorant of</div>
<div id="tv_140" class="t s2_140">the fact that he was not looking after his wife, he was looking after a human being who happened</div>
<div id="tw_140" class="t s2_140">to be his wife, but who was in such a position that just a few days’ health would release her forever</div>
<div id="tx_140" class="t s2_140">from every imprisonment. It was worth doing. And he managed it – his wife died enlightened.</div>
<div id="ty_140" class="t s2_140">This is possible in a school. If we see that somebody has developed so much that there is no harm</div>
<div id="tz_140" class="t s2_140">if everybody else contributes a little energy... so that the person can continue more in the body and</div>
<div id="t10_140" class="t s2_140">come to fulﬁllment. Alone it is not possible: it is not the way of the monk, it is the way of a mystery</div>
<div id="t11_140" class="t s2_140">school.</div>
<div id="t12_140" class="t s2_140">And Gurdjieff himself had learned all his techniques, all his experiences, in Suﬁ schools. He was</div>
<div id="t13_140" class="t s2_140">never a monk; that’s why no religious recognition has been given to him. And Suﬁ schools keep their</div>
<div id="t14_140" class="t s2_140">techniques very secret. Gurdjieff was the ﬁrst to bring them to light in the Western world.</div>
<div id="t15_140" class="t s2_140">Suﬁs were not happy, and the Western world was shocked because they were used to thinking of</div>
<div id="t16_140" class="t s2_140">religion in a totally different way: ”What he is talking about does not seem to be religion. He’s talking</div>
<div id="t17_140" class="t s2_140">almost as if it is a science” – and he was right, it is a science.</div>
<div id="t18_140" class="t s2_140">The Transmission of the Lamp</div>
<div id="t19_140" class="t s2_140">140</div>
<div id="t1a_140" class="t s3_140">Osho</div>
