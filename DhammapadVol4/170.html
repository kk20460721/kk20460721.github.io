<div id="t1_170" class="t s1_170">Krishna is an incarnation of God, and this man Jesus seems to be an intelligent child. </div>
<div id="t2_170" class="t s1_170">Krishna comes directly from the seventh paradise. Krishna is incomparable, he is the </div>
<div id="t3_170" class="t s1_170">perfect master. Jesus is good; one can say at the most, "a good man." The comparison </div>
<div id="t4_170" class="t s1_170">from the very beginning becomes impossible. </div>
<div id="t5_170" class="t s1_170">The Jaina reads the Gita, but he cannot read it the way the Hindu reads it. Their eyes are </div>
<div id="t6_170" class="t s1_170">different, their perspectives are different. The Jaina scriptures say that Krishna has </div>
<div id="t7_170" class="t s1_170">fallen into hell because he was the cause of this great war. Arjuna seems to be closer to </div>
<div id="t8_170" class="t s1_170">the heart of a Jaina, because Arjuna was saying, "I don't want to fight, I don't want to </div>
<div id="t9_170" class="t s1_170">kill. What is the point of killing these people? Just for the kingdom? And one day my </div>
<div id="ta_170" class="t s1_170">death will come and that kingdom will be gone, so what is the point? I am going to </div>
<div id="tb_170" class="t s1_170">renounce, I am going to become a monk." </div>
<div id="tc_170" class="t s1_170">And if he had escaped there is every possibility he may have become a Jaina monk. If </div>
<div id="td_170" class="t s1_170">you really want to become a monk then the best way is to become a Jaina monk, </div>
<div id="te_170" class="t s1_170">because that is the worst kind of monk possible. Other monks are so-so; the Jaina monk </div>
<div id="tf_170" class="t s1_170">is really a monk! You cannot improve upon it. </div>
<div id="tg_170" class="t s1_170">But Krishna persuaded Arjuna not to escape. He must have been a man like me, who </div>
<div id="th_170" class="t s1_170">said, "This is escape. You are a coward. Live in the world! Fight! -- because you are a </div>
<div id="ti_170" class="t s1_170">warrior, and that is your type. You can't be a monk, that is not in your nature. Follow </div>
<div id="tj_170" class="t s1_170">your nature." </div>
<div id="tk_170" class="t s1_170">Krishna says to Arjuna, "SWADHARME NIDHANAM SHREYAH PARDHARMO </div>
<div id="tl_170" class="t s1_170">BHAYAWAHAH." Never follow anybody else's idea -- that is very dangerous because </div>
<div id="tm_170" class="t s1_170">you will become imitative. Always follow your own nature, self-nature; only then will </div>
<div id="tn_170" class="t s1_170">you attain to freedom. It is better to die following one's nature than to live following </div>
<div id="to_170" class="t s1_170">somebody's else's nature, because that will be a pseudo life. To die following one's </div>
<div id="tp_170" class="t s1_170">nature is beautiful, because that death too will be authentic. </div>
<div id="tq_170" class="t s1_170">Krishna convinced Arjuna -- that is how the whole Gita was born. It is a dialogue </div>
<div id="tr_170" class="t s1_170">between Arjuna and Krishna. Arjuna was trying to escape and Krishna was pulling him </div>
<div id="ts_170" class="t s1_170">back into the world -- and finally he succeeded. </div>
<div id="tt_170" class="t s1_170">Jainas have been very angry -- they missed a good monk. They have thrown Krishna </div>
<div id="tu_170" class="t s1_170">into the seventh hell for a very long period, because he was the cause of millions of </div>
<div id="tv_170" class="t s1_170">people's deaths. India has never known a greater war since. Now, how can a Jaina read </div>
<div id="tw_170" class="t s1_170">the Gita with the same interpretation as the Hindu? Impossible. From the very </div>
<div id="tx_170" class="t s1_170">beginning the mind is prejudiced. </div>
<div id="ty_170" class="t s1_170">People are bound to think differently, because they are brought up differently, in </div>
<div id="tz_170" class="t s1_170">different religions, through different priests, different schools, different colleges, </div>
<div id="t10_170" class="t s1_170">different universities. They have been fed different ideas, ideologies -- they are bound to </div>
<div id="t11_170" class="t s1_170">think differently. And there is no way to make them think similarly -- impossible. </div>
<div id="t12_170" class="t s1_170">The only possible way is to bring them out of their minds. Then they slip out of the </div>
<div id="t13_170" class="t s1_170">whole upbringing. Then suddenly there is oneness; then you see with pure eyes, </div>
<div id="t14_170" class="t s1_170">uncontaminated by the culture and the tradition; then you see really as things are, not </div>
<div id="t15_170" class="t s1_170">as you are supposed to see them. You become a pure mirror. </div>
<div id="t16_170" class="t s1_170">Thinking can never create one world: only meditation can create one world. </div>
