<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">MARY? AND HIS BRETHREN, JAMES, AND JOSES, AND SIMON, AND </div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">JUDAS? AND HIS SISTERS, ARE THEY NOT ALL WITH US? WHENCE THEN </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">HATH THIS MAN ALL THESE THINGS? AND THEY WERE OFFENDED IN </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">HIM. </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">Nobody was so much offended in Buddha, ever; nobody was so much offended </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">in Lao Tzu, ever; nobody was offended, as people were offended with Jesus. </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">Why? A Buddha is a faraway peak. If you cannot understand him, how can you </div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">be offended with him? If you cannot understand him, how can you argue with </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">him? -- he is so far away, so beyond. At the most, all you can do is to worship </div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">him. So Buddha was worshipped and Jesus crucified. Wherever Buddha moved </div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">nobody was offended in him. Either people could not understand him -- but then </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">you could not be offended -- or people could understand him, but then they </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">understood that he was the very essence of the Upanishads, the very incarnation </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">of the Vedas. He is all essential tradition. There was no question of being </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">offended in him. </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">With Jesus people were offended, he was just like them. They could not </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">understand him. They said, "Is not this the carpenter's son?" Buddha was a son of </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">a great emperor, Mahavir also, Krishna also, Ram also. All the great Indian </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">incarnations came from royal families. Jesus is the first man who comes from a </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">poor house. Nobody had ever known him. And if Jesus had not been born, </div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">nobody would ever have heard about the family. Buddha was already </div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">established with the family name, with a long tradition and heritage, a long </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">lineage of prestige and power. Jesus comes from a powerless poor family, almost </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">a beggar. People could not understand -- "From where comes his power? From </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">where comes this wisdom? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother </div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">called Mary?" The people wondered -- "He belongs to us and talks about God. </div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">He belongs to us and says,'I am the son of God.' He belongs to us, he was </div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">working in his father's workshop and suddenly, what has happened to him?" </div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">They were offended in him, the ego was offended. </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">Buddha was always great. Even if he had not become enlightened, he would </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">have been worshipped like an emperor. People had always touched his feet. He </div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s1_5">was always great and beyond them. When he moved amidst the people and </div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s1_5">renounced his kingdom, he became even greater because he had renounced his </div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s1_5">kingdom. People can understand the language of money and they cannot </div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">understand any other language. They worship you if you have money, they </div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">worship you if you renounce money. But they understand only one language the </div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">language of money. If you don't have anything, they don't bother about you. </div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s1_5">And if you don't have anything how can you renounce, what can you renounce? </div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s1_5">This is one of the most important things to understand about the Indian mind, </div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s1_5">the so-called Indian religious mind. Even that mind can understand only the </div>
