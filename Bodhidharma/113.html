<div id="t1_113" class="t s1_113">Bodhidharma is more clear and transparent than any other enlightened person. </div>
<div id="t2_113" class="t s1_113">But the experience of enlightenment is such that you can still commit mistakes. </div>
<div id="t3_113" class="t s1_113">This is something to be understood. People ordinarily think that the man of </div>
<div id="t4_113" class="t s1_113">enlightenment cannot commit mistakes. That is their expectation, but it is not </div>
<div id="t5_113" class="t s1_113">true to reality. </div>
<div id="t6_113" class="t s1_113">The same has been the expectation of other religions, that their prophets cannot </div>
<div id="t7_113" class="t s1_113">commit mistakes. Although the KORAN is full of mistakes, Mohammedans are </div>
<div id="t8_113" class="t s1_113">not ready to accept that their prophet Mohammed can commit any mistake. THE </div>
<div id="t9_113" class="t s1_113">BIBLE is so full of mistakes, but still the popes go on declaring for twenty </div>
<div id="ta_113" class="t s1_113">centuries continuously that they are infallible. And their fallibility is so apparent. </div>
<div id="tb_113" class="t s1_113">Just as an example, Joan of Arc was declared a witch by the pope of that time. </div>
<div id="tc_113" class="t s1_113">And the pope defined a witch -- which is not the meaning of the word "witch" -- </div>
<div id="td_113" class="t s1_113">as someone who has sexual intercourse with the devil. The meaning of the word </div>
<div id="te_113" class="t s1_113">"witch" is a wise woman. And it has always been the meaning up to the Middle </div>
<div id="tf_113" class="t s1_113">Ages, when the popes started declaring wise women as being in the grip of the </div>
<div id="tg_113" class="t s1_113">devil. It was easy; first they would torture those women to such an extent that it </div>
<div id="th_113" class="t s1_113">became unbearable. Day after day they were tortured. </div>
<div id="ti_113" class="t s1_113">Finally the woman had to accept that yes, she is a witch. That was the only way </div>
<div id="tj_113" class="t s1_113">to stop her being tortured. And once she accepted and confessed that she was a </div>
<div id="tk_113" class="t s1_113">witch, she had to go to the court -- a special court appointed by the pope -- to </div>
<div id="tl_113" class="t s1_113">declare that she has been having intercourse with the devil, which is sheer </div>
<div id="tm_113" class="t s1_113">nonsense, because never before had it been known, and never afterwards -- </div>
<div id="tn_113" class="t s1_113">nobody has seen the devil. And these poor women were having intercourse with </div>
<div id="to_113" class="t s1_113">the devil, and they had to describe the whole ugly thing in every detail. And </div>
<div id="tp_113" class="t s1_113">once they confessed, the court ordered them to be burned alive. Thousands of </div>
<div id="tq_113" class="t s1_113">women in Europe were in danger and thousands had already been burned alive. </div>
<div id="tr_113" class="t s1_113">Joan of Arc fought for the freedom of her country. She was a young woman of </div>
<div id="ts_113" class="t s1_113">tremendous courage and she won freedom for the country. Hence, there was </div>
<div id="tt_113" class="t s1_113">immense respect for Joan of Arc. And the jealous pope could not allow Joan of </div>
<div id="tu_113" class="t s1_113">Arc to be left alone. It became a competition -- who is more respectable, Joan of </div>
<div id="tv_113" class="t s1_113">Arc or the pope. The easiest way was to declare her a witch. He declared her a </div>
<div id="tw_113" class="t s1_113">witch and they tortured the poor young woman until finally she had to accept. </div>
<div id="tx_113" class="t s1_113">There was no way out and she was burned alive. </div>
<div id="ty_113" class="t s1_113">But this created a very different result than that expected by the pope. He fell </div>
<div id="tz_113" class="t s1_113">more in people's eyes, and Joan of Arc became a martyr. She was loved more, she </div>
<div id="t10_113" class="t s1_113">gained more sympathy. People almost started worshiping her. So after three </div>
<div id="t11_113" class="t s1_113">hundred years another pope realized that it had been a mistake on the part of the </div>
<div id="t12_113" class="t s1_113">previous pope. He had unnecessarily created a martyr; he should have been </div>
<div id="t13_113" class="t s1_113">more careful. It was easy to destroy ordinary women but to destroy a woman </div>
<div id="t14_113" class="t s1_113">like Joan of Arc ...he had not been cautious enough. </div>
<div id="t15_113" class="t s1_113">After three hundred years, another pope declared that Joan of Arc was not a </div>
<div id="t16_113" class="t s1_113">witch, she was a saint, and her bones were dragged out of the grave and </div>
<div id="t17_113" class="t s1_113">worshiped. A great memorial was made, because now she had become "Saint </div>
