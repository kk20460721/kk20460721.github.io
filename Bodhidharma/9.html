<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">Bodhidharma turned and said, "You are really a man worthy of me. No need to </div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">cut the head, we have to use it." This man, Hui Ko, was his first disciple. </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">Finally when he left China, or intended to leave China, he called his four </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">disciples -- three more he had gathered after Hui Ko. He asked them, "In simple </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">words, in small sentences, telegraphic, tell me the essence of my teachings. I </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">intend to leave tomorrow morning to go back to the Himalayas, and I want to </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">choose from you four, one as my successor." </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">The first man said, "Your teaching is of going beyond mind, of being absolutely </div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s1_9">silent, and then everything starts happening of its own accord." </div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">Bodhidharma said, "You are not wrong, but you don't satisfy me. You just have </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">my skin." </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">The second one said, "To know that I am not, and only existence is, is your </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">fundamental teaching." </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">Bodhidharma said, "A little better, but not up to my standard. You have my </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">bones; sit down." </div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s1_9">And the third one said, "Nothing can be said about it. No word is capable of </div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s1_9">saying anything about it." </div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s1_9">Bodhidharma said, "Good, but you have said already something about it. You </div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s1_9">have contradicted yourself. Just sit down; you have my marrow." </div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s1_9">And the fourth was his first disciple, Hui Ko, who simply fell at Bodhidharma's </div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s1_9">feet, without saying a word, tears rolling down from his eyes. Bodhidharma said, </div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s1_9">"You have said it. You are going to be my successor." </div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s1_9">But in the night Bodhidharma was poisoned by some disciple as a revenge, </div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s1_9">because he had not been chosen as the successor. So they buried him, and the </div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s1_9">strangest legend is that after three years he was found by a government official, </div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s1_9">walking out of China towards the Himalayas with his staff in his hand and one </div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s1_9">of his sandals hanging from the staff -- and he was barefoot. </div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s1_9">The official had known him, had been to him many times, had fallen in love with </div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">the man, although he was a little eccentric. He asked, "What is the meaning of </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">this staff, and one sandal hanging from it?" Bodhidharma said, "Soon you will </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">know. If you meet my people just tell them that I'm going into the Himalayas </div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s1_9">forever." </div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s1_9">The official reached immediately, as fast as he could, the monastery on the </div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s1_9">mountain where Bodhidharma had been living. And there he heard that he had </div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s1_9">been poisoned and he had died... and there was the tomb. The official had not </div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s1_9">heard about it, because he was posted on the boundary lines of the empire. He </div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s1_9">said, "My God, but I have seen him, and I cannot be deceived because I have seen </div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s1_9">him many times before. He was the same man, those same ferocious eyes, the </div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s1_9">same fiery and wild outlook, and on top of it, he was carrying on his staff one </div>
<div id="t14_9" class="t s1_9">sandal." </div>
<div id="t15_9" class="t s1_9">The disciples could not contain their curiosity, and they opened the tomb. All </div>
<div id="t16_9" class="t s1_9">that they could find there was only one sandal. And then the official understood </div>
<div id="t17_9" class="t s1_9">why he had said, "You will find out the meaning of it; soon you will know." </div>
