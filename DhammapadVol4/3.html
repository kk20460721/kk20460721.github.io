<div id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">basic idea that man has to be ambitious; only the ambitious man will be able to attain </div>
<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">fulfillment. It has never happened, it will never happen, but so deep is the ignorance </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">that we go on believing in this nonsense. </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">No ambitious person has ever been happy; in fact, the ambitious person is the </div>

<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">Diogenes was a beggar; he had nothing, not even a begging bowl. At least Buddha had </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">a begging bowl with him and three robes. Diogenes was naked and with no begging </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">bowl. In the beginning he used to carry a begging bowl; he must have got the idea from </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">the East. He's exactly a man like Buddha, Mahavira -- more like Mahavira. Mahavira </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">also lived naked with no begging bowl; his hands were his begging bowl. </div>
<div id="tj_3" class="t s1_3">Diogenes was going to the river one day with his begging bowl. He was thirsty, it was </div>
<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">hot, and he wanted to drink water. And then on the way, just when he was on the bank, </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">a dog passed him by, running, panting, jumped into the river, had a good bath, drank to </div>
<div id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">his heart's content. The idea arose in Diogenes' mind: "This dog is freer than me -- he </div>
<div id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">does not have to carry a begging bowl. And if he can manage, why can't I manage </div>
<div id="to_3" class="t s1_3">without a begging bowl? This is my only possession, and I have to keep an eye on it </div>

<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">This man, who had nothing, created jealousy in Alexander's mind. How miserable he </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">must have been! He confessed to Diogenes that, "If ever again God is giving me birth, I </div>

<div id="t14_3" class="t s1_3">is in a far better, more blissful state. So why not be a Diogenes right now? Lie down on </div>
<div id="t15_3" class="t s1_3">the bank of the river where I am taking my sunbath! This bank is big enough for both of </div>
