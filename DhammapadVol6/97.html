<div id="t1_97" class="t s1_97">Don't waste time. Time is really precious, far more precious than money, far more </div>
<div id="t2_97" class="t s1_97">precious than anything in the world, because it is through time that you can contact </div>
<div id="t3_97" class="t s1_97">eternity. And these moments are rare: if you miss them once, you never know when </div>
<div id="t4_97" class="t s1_97">they will come back again. Maybe after lives you will come across a buddha again... and </div>
<div id="t5_97" class="t s1_97">there is every possibility you will repeat the same mistakes, because mind wants to </div>
<div id="t6_97" class="t s1_97">repeat. Mind is repetition -- even after lives it repeats the same mistakes. </div>
<div id="t7_97" class="t s1_97">It happened once: a young prince asked Buddha to initiate him as a BHIKKHU, as a </div>
<div id="t8_97" class="t s1_97">sannyasin. Buddha was a little reluctant. This was very rare -- buddhas are never </div>
<div id="t9_97" class="t s1_97">reluctant, or very rarely; they are always happy if somebody is asking for initiation. </div>
<div id="ta_97" class="t s1_97">Ananda, Buddha's chief disciple, immediately became aware that Buddha was a little </div>
<div id="tb_97" class="t s1_97">hesitant. He said, "Bhagwan, why are you hesitating? I have never seen you hesitate. </div>
<div id="tc_97" class="t s1_97">You persuade people, you help people, you do everything possible to bring them to the </div>
<div id="td_97" class="t s1_97">way -- and this man himself is asking! And not an ordinary man -- a great prince, with </div>
<div id="te_97" class="t s1_97">great potential. If he becomes a disciple, many more will follow. Why are you </div>
<div id="tf_97" class="t s1_97">hesitating?" </div>
<div id="tg_97" class="t s1_97">Buddha said to Ananda, "Because this young man has been initiated in the past by other </div>
<div id="th_97" class="t s1_97">buddhas at least seven times, and he has committed the same mistake again and again. </div>
<div id="ti_97" class="t s1_97">And mind is repetitive. I know I can give him initiation, but he is bound to repeat the </div>
<div id="tj_97" class="t s1_97">same mistake. But if you say so, I will initiate him. Now watch what happens." </div>
<div id="tk_97" class="t s1_97">The young man was initiated... and of course this whole dialogue with Ananda had </div>
<div id="tl_97" class="t s1_97">happened in front of him, so he was very conscious not to repeat anything. But he did </div>
<div id="tm_97" class="t s1_97">not remember anything of his past lives, and when you don't remember, how can you </div>
<div id="tn_97" class="t s1_97">avoid repetition? If you remember, you can avoid. </div>
<div id="to_97" class="t s1_97">He asked Buddha many times, "Please tell me, what is my mistake that I have been </div>
<div id="tp_97" class="t s1_97">repeating again and again? And you say I have lived with seven other buddhas? I don't </div>
<div id="tq_97" class="t s1_97">want to miss this opportunity." </div>
<div id="tr_97" class="t s1_97">Buddha said, "That won't help very much, because you have asked the sixth buddha the </div>
<div id="ts_97" class="t s1_97">same question and the fifth also, and they answered. I am not going to do it. I will tell </div>
<div id="tt_97" class="t s1_97">you only when the time arrives." </div>
<div id="tu_97" class="t s1_97">And the time arrived within a few days. They traveled to another city; they were </div>
<div id="tv_97" class="t s1_97">staying in a small caravanserai -- ten thousand sannyasins -- there was no space. It must </div>
<div id="tw_97" class="t s1_97">have been as overcrowded as it is here! Now when I look at you, I completely forget </div>
<div id="tx_97" class="t s1_97">whether you are sannyasins or sardines. I have to go on reminding myself, "No, these </div>
<div id="ty_97" class="t s1_97">are my sannyasins." </div>
<div id="tz_97" class="t s1_97">The older sannyasins of Buddha were given a little better space, a little more space -- </div>
<div id="t10_97" class="t s1_97">they were old, senior. This young man was the latest addition to the Buddha's </div>
<div id="t11_97" class="t s1_97">SANGHA -- his order; he got the place at the outermost circumference, just in the porch </div>
<div id="t12_97" class="t s1_97">where people used to put their shoes. He had to sleep there. A prince, sleeping in a </div>
<div id="t13_97" class="t s1_97">porch where people keep their shoes? He was very hurt. </div>
<div id="t14_97" class="t s1_97">In the night he could not sleep, for the same reasons that you suffer -- mosquitoes! They </div>
