<div id="t1_22" class="t s1_22">To the ancient Hindus, even a woman having five husbands was not a bad thought; the</div>
<div id="t2_22" class="t s1_22">woman who had five husbands is worshiped as one of the five great women of India! Of</div>
<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">course five husbands is not the right number because the weekend remains -- what to do with</div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">the weekend? Every day for five days the poor woman had to change husbands, and two days</div>
<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">were just a holiday. So the weekend is not something new and American; it is very ancient</div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">and Indian! Nobody has condemned it as an ugly situation. No Hindu thinker or philosopher</div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">or theologian has condemned it; it was acceptable.</div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">Yudhisthir, the eldest of the five brothers who shared one wife, is thought of by Hindus as</div>
<div id="t9_22" class="t s1_22">one of the most religious men that has ever lived on the earth. He is called Dharmaraj, the</div>
<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">"king of religiousness". And this fellow Yudhisthir was a compulsive gambler; he gambled to</div>
<div id="tb_22" class="t s1_22">the extent that he staked his whole kingdom, his whole treasury, and finally he staked his</div>
<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">wife! All five brothers were present, and they consented. And nobody has condemned it. They</div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">still go on calling Yudhisthir one of the greatest religious men -- and he has treated this</div>
<div id="te_22" class="t s1_22">woman worse than he would an animal, as if a woman were just a dead piece of property, like</div>
<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">furniture, that you can gamble with.</div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">So what is right?</div>
<div id="th_22" class="t s1_22">For the Mohammedans the KORAN is their holy source, and the KORAN says God</div>
<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">created all other animals for man to eat. Now if God says it, there is no harm in eating</div>
<div id="tj_22" class="t s1_22">animals. Except for man, all animals can be butchered and eaten without any problem. No</div>
<div id="tk_22" class="t s1_22">question of nonviolence ever arises. Then there are Jainas. Their monks keep a mask on their</div>
<div id="tl_22" class="t s1_22">nose because when you exhale the air becomes hot, and in the atmosphere there are very tiny</div>
<div id="tm_22" class="t s1_22">invisible living cells that hot air can kill. To protect those cells which you cannot see, they are</div>
<div id="tn_22" class="t s1_22">continuously keeping their nose covered with a cloth, so by the time their hot air reaches out</div>
<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">through the cloth it is no longer hot; the cloth is preventing it and cooling it. Now who is</div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">right?</div>
<div id="tq_22" class="t s1_22">There are Hindu monks who shave their hair, their mustache, their beard -- every hair has</div>
<div id="tr_22" class="t s1_22">to be removed. The reason is that they consider that hairs are dead parts of the body. In a way</div>
<div id="ts_22" class="t s1_22">they are right. Dead cells in your body are being thrown out continuously in different ways.</div>
<div id="tt_22" class="t s1_22">That's why when you cut your hair you don't feel hurt. If they were living you would have felt</div>
<div id="tu_22" class="t s1_22">the pain. So hairs are just as dead as any corpse. Why carry dead things? Hindus and their</div>
<div id="tv_22" class="t s1_22">monks remove them.</div>
<div id="tw_22" class="t s1_22">If you look at different people, different traditions, you will be simply surprised. But how</div>
<div id="tx_22" class="t s1_22">to decide what is right and what is wrong?</div>
<div id="ty_22" class="t s1_22">In China, even eating snakes is not thought to be anything strange. It is in fact one of the</div>
<div id="tz_22" class="t s1_22">most delicious foods. They just have to cut the snake's head, because its poison is only in the</div>
<div id="t10_22" class="t s1_22">mouth -- just a small gland in its mouth has the poison. They chop the head, and the remaining</div>
<div id="t11_22" class="t s1_22">part is just vegetable. If you are a guest in a Chinese house, they will certainly serve you with</div>
<div id="t12_22" class="t s1_22">it, just as a welcome, and those who have eaten it say it is delicious.</div>
<div id="t13_22" class="t s1_22">There is not a single animal, bird, insect, which is not being eaten somewhere. It will</div>
<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">create nausea in you -- what kind of people are these? But traditionally they have accepted it</div>
<div id="t15_22" class="t s1_22">as right, and once something is accepted as right, it becomes right to that tradition, to those</div>
<div id="t16_22" class="t s1_22">people. They simply laugh at you -- you are missing such beautiful food.</div>
<div id="t17_22" class="t s1_22">Chapter 2 - Insight</div>
<div id="t18_22" class="t s1_22">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
