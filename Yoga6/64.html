<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">And to clean a mirror is one thing and to destroy the mirror is another. To clean </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">the mirror is totally different, because when the mirror is clean of all dust, pure, </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">you will be able to look into it -- it will reflect you. But if you destroy the mirror, </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">then there is no possibility to look into it. If you destroy the gross body you lose </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">all possibility of contact with the second, the subtle body. Purify it, but don't be </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">destructive. </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">And how does fasting purify? Because whenever you are on a fast the body has </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">no more work of digestion. In that period the body can work in throwing out </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">dead cells, toxins. It is just as one day, Sunday or Saturday, you are on a holiday </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">and you come home and you clean the whole day. The whole week you were so </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">engaged and so busy you couldn't clean the house. When the body has nothing </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">to digest, you have not eaten anything, the body starts a self cleaning. A process </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">starts spontaneously and the body starts throwing out all that is not needed, </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">which is like a load. Fasting is a method of purification. Once in a while, a fast is </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">beautiful -- not doing anything, not eating, just resting. Take as much liquid as </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">possible and just rest, and the body will be cleaned. </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">Sometimes, if you feel that a longer fast is needed, you can do a longer fast also -- </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">but be deep in love with the body. And if you feel the fast is harming the body in </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">any way, stop it. If the fast is helping the body, you will feel more energetic; you </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">will feel more alive; you will feel rejuvenated, vitalized. This should be the </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">criterion: if you start feeling that you are getting weaker, if you start feeling that </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">a subtle trembling is coming into the body, then be aware -- now the thing is no </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">longer a purification. It has become destructive. Stop it. </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">But one should learn the whole science of it. In fact one should do fasting near </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">somebody who has been fasting for long and who knows the whole path very </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">well, who knows all the symptoms: if it becomes destructive what will start </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">happening; if it is not destructive then what will happen. After a real, purifying </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">fast you will feel new, younger, cleaner, weightless, happier; and the body will </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">be functioning better because now it is unloaded. But fasting comes only if you </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">have been eating wrongly. If you have not been eating wrongly there is no need </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">for fasting. Fasting is needed only when you have already done the wrong with </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">the body -- and we all have been eating wrongly. </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">Man has lost the path. No animal eats like man; every animal has its chosen food. </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">If you bring buffaloes in the garden and leave them, they will eat only a </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">particular grass. They will not go on eating everything and anything -- they are </div>
