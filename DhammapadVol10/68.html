<div id="t2_68" class="t s1_68">asylum if he had painted things like this. He would have been thought insane, utterly </div>
<div id="t3_68" class="t s1_68">insane, because the world of Michelangelo is a totally different world; a different </div>
<div id="t4_68" class="t s1_68">valuation existed. The world of Leonardo da Vinci is a totally different world. </div>
<div id="t5_68" class="t s1_68">Fashions go on changing. Every day man goes on changing. Nothing is, in fact, good or </div>
<div id="t6_68" class="t s1_68">bad, beautiful or ugly. It all depends on you. Whatsoever you start thinking is good, </div>
<div id="t7_68" class="t s1_68">beautiful, becomes good and beautiful. A Jaina monk moving naked is thought to be </div>
<div id="t8_68" class="t s1_68">great by the Jainas, but others think it a little obscene. Many times problems arise. </div>
<div id="t9_68" class="t s1_68">Just a few days ago in a village, there was a riot because one Jaina monk entered in the </div>

<div id="tf_68" class="t s1_68">reason is totally different; my reason is that they look so ugly. Unless you have a </div>
<div id="tg_68" class="t s1_68">beautiful body you don't have the right to be naked. I can accept Mahavira moving </div>
<div id="th_68" class="t s1_68">naked. It is said that he had one of the most beautiful bodies -- and it seems so because </div>
<div id="ti_68" class="t s1_68">all his statues are so beautiful. He must have had a very beautiful body, very </div>
<div id="tj_68" class="t s1_68">proportionate. If he moved naked, that can be understood. To cover his beautiful body </div>
<div id="tk_68" class="t s1_68">with clothes will not be right. But Jaina monks deliberately destroy their bodies. They </div>
<div id="tl_68" class="t s1_68">are masochistic people: they cripple their bodies in many ways. They make them as </div>
<div id="tm_68" class="t s1_68">ugly as they can, because the uglier your body is, the more respected you are. So they </div>
<div id="tn_68" class="t s1_68">become caricatures. They are cartoons, not real people. It is better to cover them in </div>
<div id="to_68" class="t s1_68">beautiful clothes. </div>
<div id="tp_68" class="t s1_68">It depends what your criteria are, what your values are. But in reality, nothing is good </div>

<div id="tt_68" class="t s1_68">followers of Krishnamurti think that he is teaching something very original. It has </div>

<div id="tv_68" class="t s1_68">invention. In a different sense it is original; it is original in the sense that it is his </div>

<div id="tx_68" class="t s1_68">in the sense of being new. It is original in the sense that it has originated in him. He is </div>

<div id="t12_68" class="t s1_68">truth again and again. Their language is different, their expression is different; it is </div>
<div id="t13_68" class="t s1_68">bound to be so. Twenty-five centuries have passed since Buddha. How can I speak the </div>
<div id="t14_68" class="t s1_68">same language? And how could Buddha have spoken the language that I speak? That is </div>
<div id="t15_68" class="t s1_68">impossible. But as the followers of Krishnamurti go on claiming that his teaching is </div>
<div id="t16_68" class="t s1_68">absolutely original, new -- that is utter nonsense. It is basically the same teaching as </div>
<div id="t17_68" class="t s1_68">Buddha's: choiceless awareness. That is the meaning of "reflect" and "watch." </div>
<div id="t18_68" class="t s1_68">Be aware, but don't choose. If you choose, you lose watching. If you start clinging -- </div>
