<div id="t1_88" class="t s1_88">And Christians actually say that Jesus never laughed in his life. Can you believe that? </div>
<div id="t2_88" class="t s1_88">Jesus never laughed in life? -- and he enjoyed drinking and eating, he enjoyed gamblers </div>
<div id="t3_88" class="t s1_88">and prostitutes, and he enjoyed all kinds of people, and he never laughed? Can you </div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s1_88">imagine that a man like Jesus, who was always feasting for hours with his friends, never </div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s1_88">laughed? It is inconceivable! How can you go on wining and dining without laughing? </div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s1_88">He must have joked, he must have told funny stories. They have been edited out. He </div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s1_88">was a very true man, and very courageous. He accepted Mary Magdalene, the famous </div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s1_88">prostitute of those days as his disciple. It needs courage, it needs guts. I cannot believe </div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s1_88">that he never laughed. </div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">I can rather believe a very fictitious story about Zarathustra -- that the first thing he did </div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">when he was born was to laugh loudly. That I can believe, but I can't believe this story </div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s1_88">about Jesus, that he never laughed. It looks impossible. A child... just the first thing he </div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s1_88">did was a belly laughter. But I can believe it. It has a certain beauty about it, a certain </div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s1_88">significance. It simply says that Zarathustra was born wise, he was born enlightened, </div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s1_88">that's all. Whether he laughed or not, that is not the question. </div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s1_88">And it doesn't seem too difficult: if children can cry, why can't they laugh? Doctors say </div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s1_88">that children cry just to clear their throat, so that they can breathe easily. But that can be </div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s1_88">done in a far better way by a belly laughter. And now there are doctors who say that if </div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s1_88">we take enough care children don't cry; on the contrary, they smile. That's a good </div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s1_88">beginning. Soon Zarathustras will be coming. </div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s1_88">But up to now doctors have been very Christian. The first thing they do is they hang the </div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s1_88">child upside down and hit him on the buttocks. Do you expect a child to laugh? This is </div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s1_88">a great welcome to the world, putting the child upside down, giving him a hit -- a good </div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s1_88">beginning, because his whole life he is going to get hit in the pants, again and again. </div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s1_88">And hanging upside down, how can he laugh? No wonder he cries! </div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s1_88">Now there are a few doctors working in a different direction. They bring the child in a </div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s1_88">more natural way out of the mother's womb; they don't cut the umbilical cord </div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s1_88">immediately because that creates crying, that is violence. They leave the child on the </div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s1_88">mother's belly with the umbilical cord intact. They give a good bath to the child, a hot </div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s1_88">bath, they put the child into a hot tub of exactly the same temperature as it was in the </div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s1_88">mother's womb. </div>
<div id="tw_88" class="t s1_88">In the mother's womb the child is floating in water. The water has the same contents as </div>
<div id="tx_88" class="t s1_88">sea water, salty. In the same salty chemical solution, of the same temperature, the child </div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s1_88">is put in the tub. He starts smiling. It is a real beautiful reception. And not with glaring </div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">tube lights... that hurts the eyes of the child. In fact, so many people are wearing glasses </div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s1_88">only because of the foolishness of the doctors. The child has lived for nine months in the </div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s1_88">mother's womb in darkness, utter darkness. Then suddenly so much light... it hurts his </div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s1_88">delicate eyes. You have destroyed something delicate in his eyes. The child should be </div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s1_88">received in a very dim light, and the light should be increased slowly slowly, so his eyes </div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s1_88">become accustomed to the light. Naturally the child smiles at the beautiful welcome. </div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s1_88">I can believe Zarathustra loudly laughing, but I can't believe Jesus not laughing at all. </div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s1_88">He lived thirty-three years and did not laugh? -- that can only be possible if he was </div>
<div id="t17_88" class="t s1_88">absolutely perverted, absolutely pathological, ill. Something must have been wrong if </div>
