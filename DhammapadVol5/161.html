<div id="t1_161" class="t s1_161">George got drunk in a bar one night, and as he staggered home he tried to figure how </div>
<div id="t2_161" class="t s1_161">he could hide his not very sober condition from his wife. He decided he would go home </div>
<div id="t3_161" class="t s1_161">and read, since whoever heard of a drunken man being able to read a book? And he </div>
<div id="t4_161" class="t s1_161">laughed at his own cleverness. He thought it would be good to read the Bible! </div>
<div id="t5_161" class="t s1_161">He made it home and went into the den. A few minutes later his wife called out to him, </div>
<div id="t6_161" class="t s1_161">"What are you doing in there at this hour?" </div>
<div id="t7_161" class="t s1_161">"Oh, just reading, darling -- reading the Bible," he nonchalantly replied. </div>
<div id="t8_161" class="t s1_161">Knowing reading was not one of his late evening pursuits -- and certainly nobody had </div>
<div id="t9_161" class="t s1_161">ever thought that he would read the Bible -- she got up and peeked in. "You idiot!" she </div>
<div id="ta_161" class="t s1_161">cried. "Close that suitcase and get to bed!" </div>
<div id="tb_161" class="t s1_161">When you are drunk, whatsoever you do is going to be like that. </div>
<div id="tc_161" class="t s1_161">I have heard: </div>
<div id="td_161" class="t s1_161">Mulla Nasruddin got so drunk that there was a fight with another drunkard, and he </div>
<div id="te_161" class="t s1_161">had wounds and scratches all over his face. </div>
<div id="tf_161" class="t s1_161">He came home in the middle of the night, looked into the mirror and thought, "Now, </div>
<div id="tg_161" class="t s1_161">tomorrow morning is going to be difficult!" How is he going to hide these wounds and </div>
<div id="th_161" class="t s1_161">these scratches? His wife is bound to know and she will say, "You got drunk again and </div>
<div id="ti_161" class="t s1_161">you have been fighting again!" How to hide it? </div>
<div id="tj_161" class="t s1_161">A great idea occurred to him. He searched in the medicine chest, found some ointment. </div>
<div id="tk_161" class="t s1_161">He put it on his wounds and scratches, was very happy, pleased with himself that by </div>
<div id="tl_161" class="t s1_161">morning things would not be so bad... and went to sleep. </div>
<div id="tm_161" class="t s1_161">Early in the morning when he was still in bed, his wife shouted from the bathroom, </div>
<div id="tn_161" class="t s1_161">"Who has put ointment on the mirror?" </div>
<div id="to_161" class="t s1_161">Of course a drunken man, a drunkard, looking into the mirror thinks that that is his </div>
<div id="tp_161" class="t s1_161">face. It is natural; if you are unconscious, whatsoever you do is bound to be wrong. </div>
<div id="tq_161" class="t s1_161">And there is a great metaphysical drunkenness. From many many lives it has become a </div>
<div id="tr_161" class="t s1_161">great weight on you. You have lived unconsciously for so long that the effort to live </div>
<div id="ts_161" class="t s1_161">consciously even for a few minutes seems to be too much. </div>
<div id="tt_161" class="t s1_161">You love, it is unconscious, and it becomes jealousy, possessiveness. It is no longer love, </div>
<div id="tu_161" class="t s1_161">because love cannot be unconscious. You make friends only to create enemies. You earn </div>
<div id="tv_161" class="t s1_161">money to be happy, but by the time you have earned enough money you are only </div>
<div id="tw_161" class="t s1_161">deeply tense, anxiety-ridden, and there is no joy in it. You run after power, fame, and </div>
<div id="tx_161" class="t s1_161">one day, if you make hard efforts, you certainly succeed. You become famous, but then </div>
<div id="ty_161" class="t s1_161">you realize the fact that by becoming famous nothing has been achieved. Everybody </div>
<div id="tz_161" class="t s1_161">knows you, that's all. Everybody knows your name, but how is that going to make you </div>
<div id="t10_161" class="t s1_161">happy? You have power, but what are you going to do with the power? </div>
<div id="t11_161" class="t s1_161">In the hands of an unconscious man everything turns sour, bitter, poisonous, </div>
<div id="t12_161" class="t s1_161">everything turns stupid. Give him some intelligent advice and it is bound to fall into </div>
<div id="t13_161" class="t s1_161">wrong hands. </div>
