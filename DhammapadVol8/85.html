<div id="t1_85" class="t s1_85">And philosophy has wasted so many beautiful minds that it is a crime now to go on </div>
<div id="t2_85" class="t s1_85">teaching philosophy to people. At least for five thousand years people have been </div>
<div id="t3_85" class="t s1_85">philosophizing. And what has been their conclusion? Philosophy has not come to any </div>
<div id="t4_85" class="t s1_85">conclusion at all. It confuses people. Bertrand Russell has written in his memoirs that </div>
<div id="t5_85" class="t s1_85">when he was young and went to the university, he had the thought that by studying </div>
<div id="t6_85" class="t s1_85">philosophy at least he would be able to solve a few problems. By the end of his life -- </div>
<div id="t7_85" class="t s1_85">and he lived a long, very long life, and a very philosophical life of constant thinking -- </div>
<div id="t8_85" class="t s1_85">by the end of his life he said, "All that philosophy has done is to create more problems. </div>
<div id="t9_85" class="t s1_85">It has not solved a single one. My old problems are exactly where they were. New </div>
<div id="ta_85" class="t s1_85">problems have certainly arisen out of my philosophical thinking." </div>
<div id="tb_85" class="t s1_85">And that is the experience of all thinkers, all philosophers. Philosophy is thinking about </div>
<div id="tc_85" class="t s1_85">the unknown, about God, about life after death. You don't know what life is before </div>
<div id="td_85" class="t s1_85">death, and you think about the life after death. </div>
<div id="te_85" class="t s1_85">My emphasis is, please know what life is before death, because if you can have an </div>
<div id="tf_85" class="t s1_85">experience of life before death, death will disappear in that very experience. Death </div>
<div id="tg_85" class="t s1_85">evaporates. Then there is no death; life is eternal. </div>
<div id="th_85" class="t s1_85">But rather than experiencing, the philosopher goes on thinking, and you have to make </div>
<div id="ti_85" class="t s1_85">the clear-cut distinction between thinking and experiencing. One can think about food, </div>
<div id="tj_85" class="t s1_85">but that is not going to nourish one. Eating is totally a different matter. And you may </div>
<div id="tk_85" class="t s1_85">think about very delicious food with all the vitamins thrown in. Still it is not going to </div>
<div id="tl_85" class="t s1_85">help. And just bread and butter, if really eaten, will do the trick; they will nourish you. </div>
<div id="tm_85" class="t s1_85">The philosopher thinks about love. He does not love, he does not know anything about </div>
<div id="tn_85" class="t s1_85">love. He has not experienced it, but he thinks about it. What can you think about </div>
<div id="to_85" class="t s1_85">something you have not experienced? And what is the need to think if you have </div>
<div id="tp_85" class="t s1_85">experienced? Hence I am against philosophy. In both ways it is futile. If you have not </div>
<div id="tq_85" class="t s1_85">experienced it, it is futile; if you have experienced it, it is more futile than ever. </div>
<div id="tr_85" class="t s1_85">Just recently an ape escaped from the local zoo. Must have been a philosopher! Several </div>
<div id="ts_85" class="t s1_85">hours later the beast was finally found in the reading room of the library. He was </div>
<div id="tt_85" class="t s1_85">poring over the first chapters of Genesis and he also had a copy of Darwin's THE </div>
<div id="tu_85" class="t s1_85">ORIGIN OF SPECIES. </div>
<div id="tv_85" class="t s1_85">When a policeman asked the ape what he was doing, the ape replied, "I am trying to </div>
<div id="tw_85" class="t s1_85">figure out once and for all if I am my brother's keeper or if I am my keeper's brother." </div>
<div id="tx_85" class="t s1_85">That's how philosophy goes on -- words and words. And words can be placed in such a </div>
<div id="ty_85" class="t s1_85">systematic way that they can deceive you, just like playing cards can be put in such a </div>
<div id="tz_85" class="t s1_85">way that they can give you the illusion of a palace. Paper boats can be made to look </div>
<div id="t10_85" class="t s1_85">exactly like boats; you can paint them, but they are of no use.You can't go to the other </div>
<div id="t11_85" class="t s1_85">shore by paper boats. </div>
<div id="t12_85" class="t s1_85">Philosophy is a palace made of playing cards, a boat made of paper. Painted beautifully, </div>
<div id="t13_85" class="t s1_85">it looks exactly like a boat but is not a boat. </div>
<div id="t14_85" class="t s1_85">Except existential experience nothing is going to save you. </div>
