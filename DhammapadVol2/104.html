<div id="t1_104" class="t s1_104">My effort here is to create a Socratic inquiry again, to ask again the fundamental </div>
<div id="t2_104" class="t s1_104">questions that Buddha raised. </div>
<div id="t3_104" class="t s1_104">In the new commune we are going to have seven concentric circles of people. The first, </div>
<div id="t4_104" class="t s1_104">the most superficial circle, will consist of those who come only out of childish curiosity, </div>
<div id="t5_104" class="t s1_104">or out of already accumulated prejudices, who are, deep down, antagonistic -- the </div>
<div id="t6_104" class="t s1_104">journalists, etcetera. </div>
<div id="t7_104" class="t s1_104">They will be allowed only to see the superficial part of the commune -- not that </div>
<div id="t8_104" class="t s1_104">anything will be hidden, but just because of their approach they will not be able to see </div>
<div id="t9_104" class="t s1_104">anything more than the most superficial. They will see only the garments. Here also the </div>
<div id="ta_104" class="t s1_104">same goes on happening. They come and they see only the superficial. </div>
<div id="tb_104" class="t s1_104">Just the other day I was reading a journalist's report; he was here for five days. He </div>
<div id="tc_104" class="t s1_104">writes, "for five days," as if it is a very long time to be here; five days, as if he has been </div>
<div id="td_104" class="t s1_104">here for five lives! Because he has been here for five days he has become an authority. </div>
<div id="te_104" class="t s1_104">Now he knows what is happening here because he has watched people meditating. </div>
<div id="tf_104" class="t s1_104">How can you watch people meditating? Either you can meditate or not, but you cannot </div>
<div id="tg_104" class="t s1_104">watch people meditating. Yes, you can watch people's physical gestures, movements, </div>
<div id="th_104" class="t s1_104">dance, or their sitting silently under a tree, but you cannot SEE meditation! You can see </div>
<div id="ti_104" class="t s1_104">the physical posture of the meditator, but you cannot see his inner experience. For that, </div>
<div id="tj_104" class="t s1_104">you have to meditate, you have to become a participant. </div>
<div id="tk_104" class="t s1_104">And the basic condition for being a participant is that you should drop this idea of </div>
<div id="tl_104" class="t s1_104">being a watcher. Even if you participate, if you dance with the meditators, with this </div>
<div id="tm_104" class="t s1_104">idea that you are participating only to watch what happens, then nothing will happen. </div>
<div id="tn_104" class="t s1_104">And, of course, you will go with the conclusion that it is all nonsense -- nothing </div>
<div id="to_104" class="t s1_104">happens. And you will feel perfectly right inside yourself that nothing happens, </div>
<div id="tp_104" class="t s1_104">because you even participated and nothing happened. </div>
<div id="tq_104" class="t s1_104">That man writes that he was in darshan and much was happening to sannyasins -- so </div>
<div id="tr_104" class="t s1_104">much was happening that after a deep energy contact with me they were not even able </div>
<div id="ts_104" class="t s1_104">to walk back to their places -- they had to be carried away. And then he mentions, "But </div>
<div id="tt_104" class="t s1_104">nothing happened to me." That is enough proof that all that was happening was either </div>
<div id="tu_104" class="t s1_104">hypnosis, or people were pretending just because the journalist was there, or it was just </div>
<div id="tv_104" class="t s1_104">an arranged show, something managed -- because nothing was happening to him. </div>
<div id="tw_104" class="t s1_104">There are things which can happen only when you are available, open, unprejudiced. </div>
<div id="tx_104" class="t s1_104">There are things which can happen only when you put aside your mind. </div>
<div id="ty_104" class="t s1_104">The journalist writes again, "The people who go there, they leave their minds where </div>
<div id="tz_104" class="t s1_104">they leave their shoes -- but I could not do that. Of course," he says, "if I had left my </div>
<div id="t10_104" class="t s1_104">mind behind, then I would have also been impressed." But he thinks the mind that he </div>
<div id="t11_104" class="t s1_104">has is something so valuable -- how can he leave it behind? He feels himself very clever </div>
<div id="t12_104" class="t s1_104">because he didn't leave his mind behind. </div>
<div id="t13_104" class="t s1_104">Mind is the barrier, not the bridge. In the new commune, the first concentric circle will </div>
<div id="t14_104" class="t s1_104">be for those who come like journalists -- prejudiced people, who already know that they </div>
<div id="t15_104" class="t s1_104">know. In short, for the fools. </div>
<div id="t16_104" class="t s1_104">The second concentric circle will be for those who are inquirers -- unprejudiced, neither </div>
<div id="t17_104" class="t s1_104">Hindus nor Mohammedans nor Christians, who come without any conclusion, who </div>
