<div id="t1_104" class="t s1_104">CHAPTER 8. GOD IS NOT A SOLUTION BUT A PROBLEM</div>
<div id="t2_104" class="t s2_104">move towards someone: it was for her to choose anybody she wanted. Or, if she was worried that</div>
<div id="t3_104" class="t s2_104">on what criterion... it was a difﬁcult job: a hundred princes were there, and they were all beautiful</div>
<div id="t4_104" class="t s2_104">and from royal families, and young and strong. It was not easy to choose just like that, and it was</div>
<div id="t5_104" class="t s2_104">not something that tomorrow you could reject.</div>
<div id="t6_104" class="t s2_104">In India it is not only a life-long affair, it is going to be for many lives. It is really a great burden on the</div>
<div id="t7_104" class="t s2_104">mind of the girl... how to choose? So she can take the help of God in a certain way. Some device</div>
<div id="t8_104" class="t s2_104">can be managed: that whosoever solves this puzzle will be the person she will choose. Now she is</div>
<div id="t9_104" class="t s2_104">leaving it to God – it is easier, in wiser hands.</div>
<div id="ta_104" class="t s2_104">In Sita’s Swayamvar, the device was a bow of the Lord Shiva, which was given to Sita’s father</div>
<div id="tb_104" class="t s2_104">because he was a devotee of Shiva. The bow was so heavy – of course, it was a god’s bow – that</div>
<div id="tc_104" class="t s2_104">even to take it up needed a superman. An ordinary man would not be able even to move it; and to</div>
<div id="td_104" class="t s2_104">use it – that was something almost impossible.</div>
<div id="te_104" class="t s2_104">There was a ﬁsh, an artiﬁcial ﬁsh hanging from the ceiling, and on the ground there was a small</div>
<div id="tf_104" class="t s2_104">pond which reﬂected the ﬁsh. You had to look in the pond at the reﬂection, and with Shiva’s bow and</div>
<div id="tg_104" class="t s2_104">arrow you had to shoot the ﬁsh above you – a great warrior was needed. First, the problem was how</div>
<div id="th_104" class="t s2_104">to lift up the bow. Even if you managed to lift it, then the problem was how to use it; it was not an</div>
<div id="ti_104" class="t s2_104">ordinary bow. And then the puzzle was that you had to look at the reﬂection in the water and shoot</div>
<div id="tj_104" class="t s2_104">the ﬁsh, which, like the reﬂection, was moving – it was on a wheel.</div>
<div id="tk_104" class="t s2_104">The whole country was agog. All the great warriors and kings – they all gathered there. Ravana</div>
<div id="tl_104" class="t s2_104">was one of the greatest warriors of those days. He was the king of Sri Lanka and there was every</div>
<div id="tm_104" class="t s2_104">chance that he would win the contest because he was also a devotee of Shiva, perhaps a greater</div>
<div id="tn_104" class="t s2_104">devotee than Sita’s father. His devotion to Shiva was such, so the story says, that when Shiva was</div>
<div id="to_104" class="t s2_104">not listening to him, Ravana said, ”If you don’t listen to me, then I will cut off my head and put it at</div>
<div id="tp_104" class="t s2_104">your feet. What more sacriﬁce do you want?” – and he did cut off his own head and put it at Shiva’s</div>
<div id="tq_104" class="t s2_104">feet. Of course more sacriﬁce is impossible.</div>
<div id="tr_104" class="t s2_104">Even this is a strange story – how can you cut off your own head, and then put it at Shiva’s feet?</div>
<div id="ts_104" class="t s2_104">How will you manage to ﬁnd where Shiva’s feet are? – your head is cut off, your eyes are gone!</div>
<div id="tt_104" class="t s2_104">But that’s the story – he managed it. Shiva was very happy with him and said, ”Because you have</div>
<div id="tu_104" class="t s2_104">done something which nobody has ever done, I give you something which has never been given to</div>
<div id="tv_104" class="t s2_104">anybody: you will have ten heads. Because you have sacriﬁced one, I will give you ten heads. And</div>
<div id="tw_104" class="t s2_104">any enemy cutting off one of your heads will not be able to kill you – immediately another head will</div>
<div id="tx_104" class="t s2_104">grow. Your ten heads will remain ten.”</div>
<div id="ty_104" class="t s2_104">This man with his ten heads was coming to the swayamvar. There was every fear that... and he</div>
<div id="tz_104" class="t s2_104">must have been the ugliest man; even one head is enough – but ten heads! Everybody was afraid</div>
<div id="t10_104" class="t s2_104">that he was coming and there was every chance that he would take up this bow; there seemed to be</div>
<div id="t11_104" class="t s2_104">nothing to prevent him. Rama was also participating as a prince of Ayodhya. He was a young man,</div>
<div id="t12_104" class="t s2_104">very young, and it was not known that he was a great warrior or anything. There was no possibility</div>
<div id="t13_104" class="t s2_104">for him to win the contest.</div>
<div id="t14_104" class="t s2_104">So the sages who wanted Rama to win the contest and get married to Sita arranged a conspiracy so</div>
<div id="t15_104" class="t s2_104">that when Ravana goes to pick up the bow, a man comes running and tells him that, ”Your capital”</div>
<div id="t16_104" class="t s2_104">From Ignorance to Innocence</div>
<div id="t17_104" class="t s2_104">104</div>
<div id="t18_104" class="t s3_104">Osho</div>
