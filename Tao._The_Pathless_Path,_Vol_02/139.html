<div id="t2_139" class="t s2_139">Question 3</div>
<div id="t3_139" class="t s2_139">HAVE YOU YET BEEN ABLE TO SAY TO ONE. OF YOUR DISCIPLES, ’SO, IT HAS HAPPENED!?</div>
<div id="t4_139" class="t s2_139">IF it has not happened it will not be true to say so, and if it has happened it will be futile. What is the</div>
<div id="t5_139" class="t s2_139">point of saying it when it has happened? Either way it is meaningless.</div>
<div id="t6_139" class="t s2_139">If it has not happened I will not say it and if it has happened why should I say it? You know, I know</div>
<div id="t7_139" class="t s2_139">– it will be a tacit understanding. I am not going to say to anybody that it has happened, remember.</div>
<div id="t8_139" class="t s2_139">I will never say to anybody that it has happened. It is happening tO many, it will happen to many; in</div>
<div id="t9_139" class="t s2_139">fact, it has never happened to so many people as it is going to happen this time.</div>
<div id="ta_139" class="t s2_139">But I am not going to say anything to anybody. You would like me to say something because then</div>
<div id="tb_139" class="t s2_139">you can create great politics around it. If I say to Maneesha ’Maneesha, it has happened to you’</div>
<div id="tc_139" class="t s2_139">then everybody else will be jealous. Then you will start ﬁnding fault with Maneesha. Then you will</div>
<div id="td_139" class="t s2_139">start trying to prove that it has not happened to her. How can it happen to Maneesha before you?</div>
<div id="te_139" class="t s2_139">Impossible!</div>
<div id="tf_139" class="t s2_139">Do you know that when Bodhidharma gave his robe to Hui Koju he told him a second thing? ’Escape</div>
<div id="tg_139" class="t s2_139">now. Take this robe and escape as far away as possible otherwise the other disciples will kill you.’</div>
<div id="th_139" class="t s2_139">There were ﬁve hundred disciples. So four hundred and ninety-nine would be against this Hui Koju,</div>
<div id="ti_139" class="t s2_139">who was just a simple poor man. They would kill him, certainly they would kill him. They followed</div>
<div id="tj_139" class="t s2_139">him. The moment they became aware that it had happened to Hui Koju and the robe had been given</div>
<div id="tk_139" class="t s2_139">to him, they followed him. Where had he gone? He had moved past a mountain retreat, running as</div>
<div id="tl_139" class="t s2_139">far away as possible – as the Master had told him to.</div>
<div id="tm_139" class="t s2_139">They got hold of him. The greatest scholar, who had been expecting that it would happen to him,</div>
<div id="tn_139" class="t s2_139">got hold of him ﬁrst. He was a very dangerous man. He said, ’Give me the robe.’ Hui Koju said, ’You</div>
<div id="to_139" class="t s2_139">can take the robe, because the robe is not the thing. You can take it.’ He dropped the robe on the</div>
<div id="tp_139" class="t s2_139">ground and said, ’You can take it. But remember, if you are not yet capable of taking it, it will be a</div>
<div id="tq_139" class="t s2_139">crime against the Master.’</div>
<div id="tr_139" class="t s2_139">And the scholar started trembling and shaking and perspiring, because he was certainly not ready.</div>
<div id="ts_139" class="t s2_139">He had an ego. He tried to get the robe but he could not pick it up, it was so heavy. It was not that</div>
<div id="tt_139" class="t s2_139">the robe became heavy, he must have become too shaky, nervous.</div>
<div id="tu_139" class="t s2_139">Remember, I say again: miracles never happen. If you ask the Buddhists they will say that this was</div>
<div id="tv_139" class="t s2_139">a miracle. The robe became so heavy that the man could not pick it up. That is not right. The man</div>
<div id="tw_139" class="t s2_139">became very shaky, naturally. Hui Koju was standing there as a witness – in pure silence, in great</div>
<div id="tx_139" class="t s2_139">meditation, in great ecstasy watching. And he said, ’Remember one thing: you will be committing a</div>
<div id="ty_139" class="t s2_139">crime against the Master if you are not ready for it. You can take it if you are ready.’</div>
<div id="tz_139" class="t s2_139">How can you deceive a man like Hui Koju who has become a mirror? He must have seen all this</div>
<div id="t10_139" class="t s2_139">scholar’s ignorance hidden behind the so-called knowledge. He must have trembled. He must have</div>
<div id="t11_139" class="t s2_139">tried to take the robe but could not pick it up from the ground. He fell down at the feet of Hui Koju</div>
<div id="t12_139" class="t s2_139">and he said, ’I am sorry. I am not after the robe. Tell me what he has transferred to you.’</div>
<div id="t13_139" class="t s2_139">For years Hui Koju was pursued and efforts were made to kill him.</div>
