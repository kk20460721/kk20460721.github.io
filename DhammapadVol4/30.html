<div id="t2_30" class="t s1_30">then they departed. </div>
<div id="t3_30" class="t s1_30">The disciples of Farid followed Farid and the disciples of Kabir followed Kabir back </div>
<div id="t4_30" class="t s1_30">home. When they were alone they asked, the disciples of Farid asked, "What went </div>
<div id="t5_30" class="t s1_30">wrong? You are continuously talking to us -- what happened? Why did you become </div>
<div id="t6_30" class="t s1_30">dumb? For two days why didn't you speak, and what is all this giggling?" </div>
<div id="t7_30" class="t s1_30">Farid said, "There was no need to say anything, because I am hearing the same thing </div>
<div id="t8_30" class="t s1_30">that he is hearing, I am seeing the same thing that he is seeing, so what is the point of </div>
<div id="t9_30" class="t s1_30">saying anything to him? It would have been absolutely foolish on my part. When I can </div>
<div id="ta_30" class="t s1_30">see he is hearing the same, seeing the same, being the same, we are encountering the </div>
<div id="tb_30" class="t s1_30">same reality, what is the point of saying it?" </div>
<div id="tc_30" class="t s1_30">Then they asked, "Then why did you giggle?" </div>
<div id="td_30" class="t s1_30">And he said, "We giggled because of you, because you were getting so bored! We were </div>
<div id="te_30" class="t s1_30">laughing at you. You had come to hear us talk -- you were foolish, you missed a great </div>
<div id="tf_30" class="t s1_30">opportunity. Two masters were there, utterly silent; two pools of silent energy, two </div>
<div id="tg_30" class="t s1_30">doors open simultaneously to God -- and you missed. And you wanted some words, </div>
<div id="th_30" class="t s1_30">some noise. You could have sat in silence, you could have become part of our silence. </div>
<div id="ti_30" class="t s1_30">You could have fallen EN RAPPORT with us. You didn't do that -- you were bored, you </div>
<div id="tj_30" class="t s1_30">were fed up, you were yawning. And just seeing you we giggled, we laughed at what </div>
<div id="tk_30" class="t s1_30">kind of fools we have gathered!" </div>
<div id="tl_30" class="t s1_30">Nothing can be said; when you know, there is no way to express it. But if you want to </div>
<div id="tm_30" class="t s1_30">express, then the word that comes closest to God is ''love'. Even that is just approximate, </div>
<div id="tn_30" class="t s1_30">but very close. And the word ''God' has become associated with wrong people, with </div>
<div id="to_30" class="t s1_30">wrong notions. In fact, many people feel offended the moment you utter the word </div>
<div id="tp_30" class="t s1_30">''God'. I have no attachment to that word; you can drop it. </div>
<div id="tq_30" class="t s1_30">But remember love; I cannot tell you to drop that, because without love you will never </div>
<div id="tr_30" class="t s1_30">reach God. Without God you can love, and God is bound to come in whether you know </div>
<div id="ts_30" class="t s1_30">or not, whether you believe in God or not. Belief is not a requirement: love is an </div>
<div id="tt_30" class="t s1_30">absolute necessity, a must. Sudharma, you have heard me say God is love. Experience </div>
<div id="tu_30" class="t s1_30">it, and then all fear will disappear. And start dropping the priests and the centuries of </div>
<div id="tv_30" class="t s1_30">wrong conditioning. They have made you afraid. </div>
<div id="tw_30" class="t s1_30">In fact, priests are the enemies of God, because the more people are afraid of God, the </div>
<div id="tx_30" class="t s1_30">less is the possibility of their knowing God ever -- because fear is a wall, not a bridge. </div>
<div id="ty_30" class="t s1_30">Love is a bridge, not a wall. Of course, fear helps the priests to live and exploit you, but </div>
<div id="tz_30" class="t s1_30">it deprives you of God. Priests are in the service of the Devil. If there is somebody like a </div>
<div id="t10_30" class="t s1_30">Devil, then priests are in HIS service; they are not in the service of God. </div>
<div id="t11_30" class="t s1_30">That's why so many religions are there, yet the earth remains irreligious, utterly </div>
<div id="t12_30" class="t s1_30">irreligious; so many temples and so many churches and mosques, and yet you don't see </div>
<div id="t13_30" class="t s1_30">the fragrance of religion. You don't see people's faces full of grace, their eyes full of </div>
<div id="t14_30" class="t s1_30">silence, their feet dancing, their lives showing that God is. They may say that they </div>
