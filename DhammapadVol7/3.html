<div id="t2_3" class="t s1_3">profession, it has become an escape from their true being. Argument keeps them blind. </div>
<div id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">A rabbi's son converted to Christianity and the rabbi was totally distraught. God </div>
<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">himself came down to earth to console him. "After all," said the Lord, "did not the same </div>

<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">"Yes," replied the rabbi, "but don't forget, my son was legitimate." </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">A theologian, a philosopher, a great thinker, even if he comes to encounter God, is </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">bound to argue with him. He can't see him. For seeing, silence is needed, not argument. </div>
<div id="t9_3" class="t s1_3">For seeing, love is needed, not logic. For seeing, scriptures are not needed but a totally </div>
<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">different state of mind is needed: a state of mind where thoughts have disappeared, </div>
<div id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">where the mirror of mind reflects nothing, is absolutely pure, not even a ripple of </div>
<div id="tc_3" class="t s1_3">thought. In that silence, in that mirrorlike purity you need not go anywhere else to see </div>
<div id="td_3" class="t s1_3">God. Wherever you are you will see, because God is not a person, let me repeat again: </div>
<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">God is a presence. If God was a person things would have been very easy. We would </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">have caught him, we would have imprisoned him in the temples, in the churches, in the </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">synagogues, in the mosques. If God was a person our scientists would be experimenting </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">on him in their laboratories. Pavlov wouldn't waste his time on dogs, he would </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">experiment on God. And B.F. Skinner would not remain occupied with rats. </div>
<div id="tj_3" class="t s1_3">Karl Marx actually has said that: Unless God is proved in a scientific experiment, I am </div>
<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">not going to believe. Unless God is proved in the lab, I am not going to believe. But a </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">God proved in a lab is not a God at all, cannot be a God. A God caught in the net of </div>
<div id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">arguments will be impotent, utterly dead. </div>
<div id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">A group of cannibals attacked a mission but found that the missionaries had fled. The </div>
<div id="to_3" class="t s1_3">old chief was fascinated by a pile of magazines he found, especially one that had </div>
<div id="tp_3" class="t s1_3">pictures of scantily clad women in the advertisements. Whenever he would come to a </div>
<div id="tq_3" class="t s1_3">picture of a woman with very little on, he would tear out the page and eat it. </div>
<div id="tr_3" class="t s1_3">Finally one of his sons noticed what he was doing and said, "Tell me, dad, is that </div>
<div id="ts_3" class="t s1_3">dehydrated stuff any good?" </div>
<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">But that's what people are doing. When you are pondering over the Bible, the Gita, the </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">Koran, it is all dehydrated stuff. It is not going to nourish you. What is your Christianity </div>
<div id="tv_3" class="t s1_3">and what is your Hinduism, and what is your Mohammedanism? A really religious </div>
<div id="tw_3" class="t s1_3">person cannot be Christian, and cannot be Mohammedan, and cannot be Hindu. Yes, he </div>
<div id="tx_3" class="t s1_3">can be an Ayatollah Khomeini, but not a Mohammedan, not really a religious person. </div>
<div id="ty_3" class="t s1_3">Fanatics, lunatics, obsessed with unnecessary formalities</div>

<div id="t10_3" class="t s1_3">What is the difference between a Christian and a Hindu and a Jew? If you look deep </div>
<div id="t11_3" class="t s1_3">down there is no difference; all the difference is formal, and they are obsessed with the </div>
<div id="t12_3" class="t s1_3">formalities. Dehydrated stuff has become much too significant. </div>
