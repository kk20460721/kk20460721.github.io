<div id="t1_133" class="t s1_133">CHAPTER 8. I SURE DIG YOU, MAN</div>
<div id="t2_133" class="t s2_133">Now the other personality must have taken possession of her. She did not report to the police here</div>
<div id="t3_133" class="t s2_133">in Poona. If there had been something wrong with her she should have gone to the police. She went</div>
<div id="t4_133" class="t s2_133">to police in Bombay and reported that she had been beaten – so much so that the room was full of</div>
<div id="t5_133" class="t s2_133">blood – her clothes had been torn apart and she had to go out of the ashram naked to the hotel!</div>
<div id="t6_133" class="t s2_133">Now, do you think a beautiful woman like Eva Renzi walking naked on the Poona streets would have</div>
<div id="t7_133" class="t s2_133">survived? Nobody remembers a naked woman in the ’Blue Diamond’, bleeding and going there;</div>
<div id="t8_133" class="t s2_133">nobody had seen her. There are thousands of people here the whole day: nobody had seen her</div>
<div id="t9_133" class="t s2_133">going and leaving, naked, bleeding, shouting, crying; nobody had seen her. She reported to the</div>
<div id="ta_133" class="t s2_133">police in Bombay, not here. And the police came and searched and found the whole thing was a lie.</div>
<div id="tb_133" class="t s2_133">But I don’t think that she is lying; it is her other personality, her other self. The other person had</div>
<div id="tc_133" class="t s2_133">taken possession of her, not that she was lying knowingly. When the other person takes possession,</div>
<div id="td_133" class="t s2_133">it becomes impossible – you don’t know what you are saying, why you are saying it.</div>
<div id="te_133" class="t s2_133">The people who are split function almost like two persons. When they are in one personality they are</div>
<div id="tf_133" class="t s2_133">one person, when they are in another personality they are a different person, and both personalities</div>
<div id="tg_133" class="t s2_133">never meet.</div>
<div id="th_133" class="t s2_133">Now she has created much fuss in Germany, in the newspapers, but I feel real compassion for her. I</div>
<div id="ti_133" class="t s2_133">invite her again. I have not seen her. All this just happened within a day, I have not seen her. I would</div>
<div id="tj_133" class="t s2_133">like to see her and help her; she needs help. And she has gone so deeply into this schizophrenia</div>
<div id="tk_133" class="t s2_133">that I don’t think she can be helped anywhere else. If she comes back it will be good: those two</div>
<div id="tl_133" class="t s2_133">personalities can be welded again. But it will need patience. If she had come with her husband or</div>
<div id="tm_133" class="t s2_133">some friends it would have been better. They would have prevented her from escaping so soon.</div>
<div id="tn_133" class="t s2_133">A little time will be needed. A lifelong pattern can’t be changed in one day. And the schizophrenics</div>
<div id="to_133" class="t s2_133">have their own ideas about things. They are so full of their own madness that they think everybody</div>
<div id="tp_133" class="t s2_133">else is mad. Their projections are such, they feel that they are being persecuted, everybody is going</div>
<div id="tq_133" class="t s2_133">to murder them or kill them.</div>
<div id="tr_133" class="t s2_133">Once it happened :I had to live in the same room with a professor for a few months.</div>
<div id="ts_133" class="t s2_133">He was a</div>
<div id="tt_133" class="t s2_133">schizophrenic. When he was good he was utterly good, a really nice fellow, but when he was bad he</div>
<div id="tu_133" class="t s2_133">was really bad. And it was very difﬁcult to know when he was going to be good, when he was going</div>
<div id="tv_133" class="t s2_133">to be bad. In the middle of the night he would start shouting or would start provoking me to ﬁght with</div>
<div id="tw_133" class="t s2_133">him. If you didn’t ﬁght, you didn’t honor him. If you didn’t start ﬁghting, then he would be angry. If you</div>
<div id="tx_133" class="t s2_133">fought him you unnecessarily got into trouble with him. And then the neighbors would come, and he</div>
<div id="ty_133" class="t s2_133">would shout and he would make such fuss. And by the morning he would have forgotten everything!</div>
<div id="tz_133" class="t s2_133">If you reminded him he would say, ”No, you must have dreamt it.” If you called the neighbors he</div>
<div id="t10_133" class="t s2_133">would say, ”They must have been dreaming, because I have slept so well the whole night.” It was so</div>
<div id="t11_133" class="t s2_133">difﬁcult. I would go to the university to teach; when I would come home all my things would be gone!</div>
<div id="t12_133" class="t s2_133">He had two personalities. The other personality was really something! He would store everything</div>
<div id="t13_133" class="t s2_133">in his suitcases and lock them. When he was good he would be very generous, he would give his</div>
<div id="t14_133" class="t s2_133">things to me. I enjoyed living with him for a few months because it was such a surprise – you never</div>
<div id="t15_133" class="t s2_133">knew what was going to happen today. And when he was in his bad personality, in the neurotic,</div>
<div id="t16_133" class="t s2_133">he was so afraid, that anything... and he would think the murderer was coming or the police were</div>
<div id="t17_133" class="t s2_133">coming to catch hold of him. And he would imagine: just a jeep passing by in the middle of the night</div>
<div id="t18_133" class="t s2_133">The Secret of Secrets, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t19_133" class="t s2_133">133</div>
<div id="t1a_133" class="t s3_133">Osho</div>
