<div id="t2_163" class="t s1_163">almost appears like truth, but is not truth. It has been manufactured by your </div>
<div id="t3_163" class="t s1_163">mind. A doctrine is man-made; a siddhanta has nothing to do with man and his </div>
<div id="t4_163" class="t s1_163">effort. A siddhanta is a vision -- you come upon it. </div>
<div id="t5_163" class="t s1_163">For example, a blind man can think about light and can try to figure out what it </div>
<div id="t6_163" class="t s1_163">is all about. He can even listen to great treatises on light and he can make a </div>
<div id="t7_163" class="t s1_163">certain idea about it -- what it is. But he will be as far away from light as he was </div>
<div id="t8_163" class="t s1_163">before. He can even expound the doctrine about light, he can explain its physics, </div>
<div id="t9_163" class="t s1_163">he can explain its structure. He can go deep into the constituents of light, he can </div>
<div id="ta_163" class="t s1_163">talk about, he can write a Ph.D on it, a thesis. He can be declared a doctor by a </div>
<div id="tb_163" class="t s1_163">university, because he has propounded a doctrine -- but still he does not know </div>
<div id="tc_163" class="t s1_163">what light is. He has no eyes to see. </div>
<div id="td_163" class="t s1_163">A siddhanta is one which you have seen, which has been revealed to you, which </div>
<div id="te_163" class="t s1_163">has become your own experience, which you have encountered. A doctrine is </div>
<div id="tf_163" class="t s1_163">almost imaginary, it is not real. A doctrine is almost always borrowed. You can </div>
<div id="tg_163" class="t s1_163">hide your borrowing in many ways -- subtle, cunning ways. You can </div>
<div id="th_163" class="t s1_163">reformulate, you can take from many sources and you can rearrange everything, </div>
<div id="ti_163" class="t s1_163">but a doctrine is a borrowed thing -- nothing original in it. </div>
<div id="tj_163" class="t s1_163">A siddhanta is absolutely original, new. It is your authentic experience. You have </div>
<div id="tk_163" class="t s1_163">come to see what reality is. It is an immediate perception, it is a benediction, it is </div>
<div id="tl_163" class="t s1_163">a blessing, it is a grace, a gift. You have arrived and you have seen what truth is. </div>
<div id="tm_163" class="t s1_163">The statement of a realization is siddhanta. Propounding a doctrine is one thing; </div>
<div id="tn_163" class="t s1_163">giving expression to a siddhanta is totally different. </div>
<div id="to_163" class="t s1_163">I have heard: </div>
<div id="tp_163" class="t s1_163">Once Mulla Nasrudin was talking to a few of his friends. He was telling his pals </div>
<div id="tq_163" class="t s1_163">about the wonderful vacation he and his family had just had in the United States. </div>
<div id="tr_163" class="t s1_163">'It is a wonderful country,' he exclaimed. 'Nowhere in the world is a stranger </div>
<div id="ts_163" class="t s1_163">treated so well. You walk along the street and you meet a well-dressed fellow </div>
<div id="tt_163" class="t s1_163">with lots of dollars. He tips his hat and smiles at you, and you talk together. He </div>
<div id="tu_163" class="t s1_163">invites you into his big car, and shows you the town. He buys you a fine dinner, </div>
<div id="tv_163" class="t s1_163">then takes you to the theatre. You have more fine food and plenty of drinks, and </div>
<div id="tw_163" class="t s1_163">he invites you to his house and you sleep nice all night. Next morning... </div>
<div id="tx_163" class="t s1_163">'What, Nasrudin,' a listener said, 'did all this really happen to you ? ' </div>
<div id="ty_163" class="t s1_163">'No, not exactly, but it all happened to my wife,' said Nasrudin. </div>
<div id="tz_163" class="t s1_163">A doctrine is that which has happened to somebody else. You have heard about </div>
<div id="t10_163" class="t s1_163">it. It has not happened to you -- it is borrowed, dirty, ugly. A siddhanta is virgin. </div>
<div id="t11_163" class="t s1_163">A doctrine is a prostitute. It has been moving through many minds, through </div>
<div id="t12_163" class="t s1_163">many hands. It is like dirty currency; it goes on changing its owner. A siddhanta </div>
<div id="t13_163" class="t s1_163">is something absolutely fresh. It has never happened before, it will never happen </div>
<div id="t14_163" class="t s1_163">again. It has happened to you. A siddhanta is deeply individual, it is a personal </div>
<div id="t15_163" class="t s1_163">vision of reality. </div>
