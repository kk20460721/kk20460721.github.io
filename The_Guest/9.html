<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">CHAPTER 1. A MEETING WITH THE GUEST</div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s2_9">Adolf Hitler killed millions of people, and those who have looked deeply into his mind are all</div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s2_9">convinced of one fact: that he was very much afraid of death. He was afraid of death, so much</div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s2_9">so that he never allowed anybody to be in his room in the night, not even the woman that he had</div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s2_9">fallen in love with once. Nobody was ever allowed to stay in the same room. He would lock the</div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s2_9">room, check everything, because while he was asleep somebody could kill him. Who knows? – the</div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s2_9">woman he had fallen in love with may be just a spy. He never allowed anybody to come close to</div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s2_9">him, too close, he was so much afraid.</div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s2_9">He got married only three hours before he was going to commit suicide; there was not even a chance</div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s2_9">for the honeymoon. In fact that was his honeymoon – suicide. In the middle of the night the priest</div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s2_9">was called to marry him to the woman he had been in a kind of relationship with – it could not have</div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s2_9">been of love, because a man like Hitler cannot love. They were married, and the next thing they did</div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s2_9">after marriage was that they killed themselves. Now there was no fear, he could allow the woman to</div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s2_9">come close – he was going to commit suicide anyway. All was lost, the game was lost, the enemy</div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s2_9">had entered into the capital. He could hear the bombs exploding just close by; now there was no</div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s2_9">hope, he had failed. Now he could get married. For what? For twenty years he had been waiting,</div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s2_9">for twenty years the woman had been waiting, but he was so afraid of bringing anybody too close.</div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s2_9">This man killed millions of people for stupid reasons. He killed Jews, MILLIONS of Jews, with this</div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s2_9">stupid idea: that it was because of the Jews that Germany – the race, the country, the nation – had</div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s2_9">fallen low; because of Jews the First World War had been lost. Now these are all stupid reasons,</div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s2_9">with no logic, no relevance. Jews had nothing to do with the First World War, they had nothing to</div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s2_9">do with the fall of the German race. Really, they had given the greatest geniuses that Germany has</div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s2_9">ever known: Karl Marx was a Jew, Sigmund Freud was a Jew, Albert Einstein was a Jew. In fact it</div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s2_9">was the Jews who were the cream, but he killed millions of Jews.</div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s2_9">Deep down, it seems he was suffering from an inferiority complex. And deep down he was suffering</div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s2_9">from so much fear of death that he wanted to kill to convince himself that ”If I kill so many people, if</div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s2_9">I can kill millions of people, then I am beyond death. I am so powerful.”</div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s2_9">A man who is afraid of death is dangerous, dangerous to himself and to others. And the fear arises</div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s2_9">out of a very fallacious beginning; the fallacy is that we think we are separate. But consciousness</div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s2_9">has that possibility. Man has been given such a potential power of being conscious that he has to be</div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s2_9">very careful how he uses it. Remember, if you move on plain ground there is no danger of falling; if</div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s2_9">you move in the mountains, if you go towards the peaks, there is great danger of falling. The higher</div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s2_9">you move, the danger becomes</div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s2_9">more and more acute.</div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s2_9">Man is the only animal who is moving higher, at the peaks, towards the</div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s2_9">peaks. Consciousness is the mountain and we have to be very alert.</div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s2_9">And that is the whole teaching of all the Buddhas and all the Krishnas and all the Christs, and that is</div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s2_9">the teaching of Kabir: be conscious, be so conscious that you don’t create the self, be so alert that</div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s2_9">the self is not created at all. Self-consciousness is a dis-ease. Just consciousness is great freedom,</div>
<div id="t14_9" class="t s2_9">liberation. By being just conscious, sooner or later you will become God-conscious. By becoming</div>
<div id="t15_9" class="t s2_9">self-conscious, sooner or later you will lose even that small consciousness that lingers behind the</div>
<div id="t16_9" class="t s2_9">self like a small tail; that consciousness will also disappear.</div>
<div id="t17_9" class="t s2_9">The Guest</div>
<div id="t18_9" class="t s2_9">9</div>
<div id="t19_9" class="t s3_9">Osho</div>
