<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">When he became aware, alert, watchful, a witness, when he saw the absurdity of desire, </div>

<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">The moment you see it as a wall the transformation has happened. </div>

<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">The question is of SEEING, the question is of understanding your life, its unconscious </div>

<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">miracle is that if you can understand the darkness in which you are living, suddenly </div>
