<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">never means moral purity; by purity he means childlike innocence. There is a great </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">difference between moral purity and childlike innocence. Moral purity is cunning, </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">clever. It is not really purity, it is something imposed. It has a motivation. The moral </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">person is trying to attain to heaven, to otherworldly joys; he wants to become immortal. </div>
