<div id="t2_174" class="t s1_174">higher than chemistry, higher than physiology. It is not lust, you can't call it lust. It is as </div>
<div id="t3_174" class="t s1_174">passionate as lust or more so, because very few people die for a woman and very few </div>
<div id="t4_174" class="t s1_174">people die for a man. But this man died for his paintings. This is psychological; this is </div>
<div id="t5_174" class="t s1_174">far better. </div>
<div id="t6_174" class="t s1_174">But there is still a higher state: the spiritual love, the love of a Buddha, the love of a </div>
<div id="t7_174" class="t s1_174">Jesus, the love of a Krishna. It is totally different. It is not even aesthetic, psychological; </div>
<div id="t8_174" class="t s1_174">it is spiritual. Now love has the expression of compassion -- passion has turned into </div>
<div id="t9_174" class="t s1_174">compassion. Buddha loves the whole of existence, because he has too much and he has </div>
<div id="ta_174" class="t s1_174">to share it. He is burdened by the love released in him; the love has to be shared with </div>
<div id="tb_174" class="t s1_174">the trees, with the birds, with people, with animals, with whosoever comes by. </div>
<div id="tc_174" class="t s1_174">At the lowest when love is just lust, physiological, it is an exploitation of the other, it is </div>
<div id="td_174" class="t s1_174">using the other as a means. Soon it is finished. Once you have exploited the woman or </div>
<div id="te_174" class="t s1_174">the man you lose interest; the interest was only for the moment. The moment the </div>
<div id="tf_174" class="t s1_174">woman is well-known to you you are finished with her. You have used the other </div>
<div id="tg_174" class="t s1_174">human being as a means -- which is ugly, which is immoral. To use another human </div>
<div id="th_174" class="t s1_174">being as a means is the most immoral act in existence, because each human being is an </div>
<div id="ti_174" class="t s1_174">end unto himself. </div>
<div id="tj_174" class="t s1_174">Psychological love knows how to sacrifice. The art, the poetry, the painting, the music, </div>
<div id="tk_174" class="t s1_174">the dance, becomes the end, they are no more means. YOU become a means. The </div>
<div id="tl_174" class="t s1_174">biological love reduces the other to a means; the psychological love raises the other as </div>
<div id="tm_174" class="t s1_174">the end. </div>
<div id="tn_174" class="t s1_174">But in the spiritual world there is no question of means and ends, there is no question of </div>
<div id="to_174" class="t s1_174">the other; there are not two. Buddha loves the existence because Buddha has become </div>
<div id="tp_174" class="t s1_174">the existence itself. There is no question of 'I' and 'thou'; it is not a dialogue. At the point </div>
<div id="tq_174" class="t s1_174">of the ultimate consciousness love is not a dialogue; there is no I/thou relationship, it is </div>
<div id="tr_174" class="t s1_174">not a relationship. It is pure overflowing of love. </div>

<div id="tt_174" class="t s1_174">buddha is a flame of love, just pure flame with no smoke. The smoke comes from lust. </div>
<div id="tu_174" class="t s1_174">When there is no lust, when you don't want to get anything out of your love, when you </div>
<div id="tv_174" class="t s1_174">simply want to give, when you feel obliged because others accept your love, the flame is </div>
<div id="tw_174" class="t s1_174">without smoke. It is pure, it is pure gold. </div>
<div id="tx_174" class="t s1_174">And do you know? -- love rises always upwards, just like the flame always rises </div>
<div id="ty_174" class="t s1_174">upwards. The flame never goes downwards. Lust is like water, it goes downwards; love </div>
<div id="tz_174" class="t s1_174">is like a flame, fire, it always goes upwards. And between the two is the psychological </div>
<div id="t10_174" class="t s1_174">phenomenon: something of lust in it, passion, and something of compassion in it. It is </div>
<div id="t11_174" class="t s1_174">just in the middle. It has some quality of the lower and some quality of the higher to it. </div>
<div id="t12_174" class="t s1_174">Hence when the poet is in his poetic mood he is almost like the mystic, but it is only a </div>
<div id="t13_174" class="t s1_174">question of mood. When he is not in his poetic mood he is just as ordinary or maybe </div>
<div id="t14_174" class="t s1_174">more ordinary than the so-called ordinary people. You may have observed it: when a </div>
<div id="t15_174" class="t s1_174">musician drowns himself in his music he rises to such peaks, such ephemeral peaks, </div>
<div id="t16_174" class="t s1_174">that you can feel the presence of great mystery. And the same musician you can see </div>
<div id="t17_174" class="t s1_174">sitting in some hotel drinking tea, talking all kinds of nonsense. He looks too ordinary; </div>
