<div id="t2_24" class="t s1_24">one never comes across, cannot come across. </div>
<div id="t3_24" class="t s1_24">There are problems and problems, but you never know what is the problem; then the </div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s1_24">question is abstract. There is nothing like "the problem." There are problems because a </div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s1_24">problem is a conflict within you. You must be having two minds within you; then the </div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s1_24">problem arises. You don't know where to go, this way or that; then the problem arises. </div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s1_24">The problem is a question of your duality: you feel to do this, and you also feel to do that, </div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s1_24">and the problem arises. But if you are one, there is no problem. You simply move. </div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s1_24">Whenever you ask an abstract question, like "What is a problem?" or "What is </div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s1_24">yellowness?" or "What is love?" it becomes difficult. </div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s1_24">St. Augustine has said, "I know what time is, but when people ask me, "What is time?" </div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s1_24">suddenly I lose all track. "Everybody knows what time is, but if somebody asks what it is, </div>
<div id="td_24" class="t s1_24">exactly, you will be in difficulty. You can show what the time is, but what is time, just </div>
<div id="te_24" class="t s1_24">pure, abstract? </div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s1_24">But I understand why this problem has arisen. There are a few people who are so </div>
<div id="tg_24" class="t s1_24">confused, they cannot even decide what the problem is. They are so confused, standing </div>
<div id="th_24" class="t s1_24">on such a crossroad, that to decide what the solution is is far away -- they have not even </div>
<div id="ti_24" class="t s1_24">decided what the problem is. There are many, because you have lost contact with your </div>
<div id="tj_24" class="t s1_24">feeling, your existential heart. So even the problem has to be supplied by somebody else, </div>
<div id="tk_24" class="t s1_24">not only the solution. You are asking me that I should tell you what your problem is. Not </div>
<div id="tl_24" class="t s1_24">only do you depend on me for the solution, you depend on me for the problem also. But </div>
<div id="tm_24" class="t s1_24">this is how it has been done in the past. </div>
<div id="tn_24" class="t s1_24">When people come to me I can immediately see whether their problem is theirs or they </div>
<div id="to_24" class="t s1_24">have borrowed it. If a Christian comes he brings a problem which no Hindu can ever </div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s1_24">bring. When a Jew comes he brings a problem no Christian can ever bring. When a Jain </div>
<div id="tq_24" class="t s1_24">comes he brings a totally different problem which no Hindu can ever bring. What </div>
<div id="tr_24" class="t s1_24">happens? These problems cannot be life problems because life problems cannot be </div>
<div id="ts_24" class="t s1_24">Jewish, Hindu, Christian, Jain. Life problems are simply life problems. These problems </div>
<div id="tt_24" class="t s1_24">are theological; they have been taught. They have been taught the problems also -- what </div>
<div id="tu_24" class="t s1_24">to ask. </div>
<div id="tv_24" class="t s1_24">Very cunning people have been exploiting humanity. First they teach you what to ask, </div>
<div id="tw_24" class="t s1_24">and then they have the answer also. If you ask the right question, they will supply the </div>
<div id="tx_24" class="t s1_24">right answer. And both are bogus because the question has been taught by them and then </div>
<div id="ty_24" class="t s1_24">you ask. And they teach you only questions which they can answer. So the game goes on </div>
<div id="tz_24" class="t s1_24">very well, perfectly well. </div>
<div id="t10_24" class="t s1_24">If you go to a Jain monk and you have not been taught by Jains what questions to ask, </div>
<div id="t11_24" class="t s1_24">you will create trouble. You will create embarrassment there because you will ask </div>
<div id="t12_24" class="t s1_24">questions to which the tradition -- their tradition -- does not supply the solutions. If you </div>
<div id="t13_24" class="t s1_24">ask a Jain why God created the world, he will be puzzled because in his theology there is </div>
<div id="t14_24" class="t s1_24">no God. In his theology there has never been anything created. The world has existed </div>
<div id="t15_24" class="t s1_24">forever and forever and forever. Creation has never been there. So if you ask why God </div>
<div id="t16_24" class="t s1_24">created the world, your question is totally absurd for a Jain because there is no God and </div>
<div id="t17_24" class="t s1_24">there is no creation; the world has continued. The word "creation" does not exist in Jain </div>
<div id="t18_24" class="t s1_24">language because creation implies the existence of a creator; and there is no creation, so </div>
<div id="t19_24" class="t s1_24">how can the creator be there? The world is, but it is not a creation. It is eternal, uncreated; </div>
<div id="t1a_24" class="t s1_24">it has remained always there. </div>
