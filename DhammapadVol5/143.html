<div id="t2_143" class="t s1_143">....</div>
<div id="t3_143" class="t s1_143">And if you are really following the awakened ones </div>
<div id="t4_143" class="t s1_143">you will follow joyfully, because a man without distractions and dreams is naturally </div>
<div id="t5_143" class="t s1_143">joyful. Not that he has something to be joyful about, not that he has attained great </div>
<div id="t6_143" class="t s1_143">money, power, prestige, or the power to do miracles -- the power to walk on water and </div>
<div id="t7_143" class="t s1_143">cure the blind people and help the dead to be alive again. No, he has no reason to be </div>
<div id="t8_143" class="t s1_143">joyful. But just because all the distractions of the mind have disappeared, the energy </div>
<div id="t9_143" class="t s1_143">involved in the distractions is released -- that energy is joy. </div>
<div id="ta_143" class="t s1_143">William Blake is right. He says: Energy is delight. William Blake has many beautiful </div>
<div id="tb_143" class="t s1_143">insights. He is one of the greatest poets the West has produced. Just a few steps more </div>
<div id="tc_143" class="t s1_143">and he would have been an enlightened person. These two poets -- Walt Whitman and </div>
<div id="td_143" class="t s1_143">William Blake -- they could have been RISHIS, seers. Just a few steps, maybe only one </div>
<div id="te_143" class="t s1_143">step, a little jump... but they had come very close to the boundary of realization. </div>
<div id="tf_143" class="t s1_143">William Blake says: Energy is delight. He is right -- this is a great revelation. It can't be </div>
<div id="tg_143" class="t s1_143">said without experiencing it somehow, in howsoever small a measure. </div>
<div id="th_143" class="t s1_143">Your joy is always caused from the outside. You have won a lottery and you are joyful; </div>
<div id="ti_143" class="t s1_143">you have purchased a house that, for many years, you have been longing for -- and you </div>
<div id="tj_143" class="t s1_143">are happy; you have found the woman that you had desired and you are happy. But </div>
<div id="tk_143" class="t s1_143">these are momentary happinesses. After two or three days the house will be old, and </div>
<div id="tl_143" class="t s1_143">after a few days the woman will look ordinary. How long can one remain interested in a </div>
<div id="tm_143" class="t s1_143">woman or in a man? Because these are superficial attractions, sooner or later the reality </div>
<div id="tn_143" class="t s1_143">will be revealed. </div>
<div id="to_143" class="t s1_143">The Nazi leader, Goring, was seated next to a fine blonde Aryan FRAULEIN at a very </div>
<div id="tp_143" class="t s1_143">important state dinner. During dessert he began feeling her leg under the table. As his </div>
<div id="tq_143" class="t s1_143">hand moved up her thigh he heard a hoarse masculine whisper, "Don't be surprised </div>
<div id="tr_143" class="t s1_143">when you get to my balls -- I am Secret Agent X-7." </div>

<div id="tv_143" class="t s1_143">When you fall in love with a woman, she is a totally different kind of person. When you </div>
<div id="tw_143" class="t s1_143">are married to her, to your surprise, she is no longer the same person. Sometimes you </div>
<div id="tx_143" class="t s1_143">suspect: what has happened? Has she deceived you? But she is also in the same </div>
<div id="ty_143" class="t s1_143">situation. She is worried: where has that beautiful man disappeared to? </div>
<div id="tz_143" class="t s1_143">There are old stories of frogs becoming beautiful princes. In my own experience just the </div>

<div id="t12_143" class="t s1_143">Those stories have some truth in them. If frogs can become princes, why not vice versa? </div>
<div id="t13_143" class="t s1_143">Nobody has ever seen a frog becoming a prince, and everybody has seen many princes </div>
<div id="t14_143" class="t s1_143">becoming frogs! </div>
<div id="t15_143" class="t s1_143">ARISE AND WATCH. The essential core of Buddha's message is awareness, </div>
<div id="t16_143" class="t s1_143">mindfulness. Look at your own mind. Don't get involved with it, remain unidentified. </div>
