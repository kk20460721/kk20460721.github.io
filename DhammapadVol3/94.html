<div id="t3_94" class="t s1_94">Maya, you have not understood me. I had not told you that to be a sannyasin means "to </div>
<div id="t4_94" class="t s1_94">be ready to live a very lonely life." From where did you get this idea of living a very </div>
<div id="t5_94" class="t s1_94">lonely life? Certainly one has to be able to live alone, but to live alone does not mean </div>
<div id="t6_94" class="t s1_94">that you cannot relate; on the contrary, a man who can live alone becomes so full of joy, </div>
<div id="t7_94" class="t s1_94">becomes so brimful, that he HAS to relate. He becomes a raincloud -- he has to shower. </div>
<div id="t8_94" class="t s1_94">He becomes a flower so full of fragrance that he has to open its petals and allow its </div>
<div id="t9_94" class="t s1_94">fragrance to be released to the winds. </div>
<div id="ta_94" class="t s1_94">A person who knows how to be alone becomes so full of song that he has to sing it. And </div>
<div id="tb_94" class="t s1_94">where can you sing a song? You can sing a song only in love, in relating, in sharing with </div>
<div id="tc_94" class="t s1_94">people. But you can share only if you have in the first place. </div>
<div id="td_94" class="t s1_94">The problem is that people don't have any joy in their being and they are bent upon </div>
<div id="te_94" class="t s1_94">sharing it. Now, two miserable people bent upon sharing their joys with each other -- </div>
<div id="tf_94" class="t s1_94">what is going to happen? The misery will not be doubled, it will be multiplied. </div>
<div id="tg_94" class="t s1_94">That's what people are doing to each other: husbands to wives and wives to husbands, </div>
<div id="th_94" class="t s1_94">and parents to children and children to parents, and friends to friends. In fact enemies </div>
<div id="ti_94" class="t s1_94">are not so inimical as friends prove finally: torturing each other, unloading their </div>
<div id="tj_94" class="t s1_94">miseries on each other, throwing their dirt on each other. They are stinking -- what can </div>
<div id="tk_94" class="t s1_94">they do? When they come close to you, you have to suffer their stink. And you have to </div>
<div id="tl_94" class="t s1_94">suffer if you want them to suffer YOUR stink. So it is a bargain. </div>
<div id="tm_94" class="t s1_94">You cannot live alone, they cannot live alone -- you have to be together. Even if it stinks, </div>
<div id="tn_94" class="t s1_94">at least there is the consolation that "I am not alone." </div>
<div id="to_94" class="t s1_94">A man who knows how to be alone knows how to be meditative. Aloneness means </div>
<div id="tp_94" class="t s1_94">meditation -- just relishing your own being, celebrating your own being. </div>
<div id="tq_94" class="t s1_94">Walt Whitman says: I celebrate myself, I sing myself. That is aloneness. This man </div>
<div id="tr_94" class="t s1_94">Whitman is really a mystic, not just a poet. He should be counted with the ancient </div>

<div id="tt_94" class="t s1_94">Whitman is really one of the most precious gifts of America to the world. He says: I </div>
<div id="tu_94" class="t s1_94">celebrate myself, I sing myself. That's what a mystic has always been supposed to do, </div>
<div id="tv_94" class="t s1_94">that's what a mystic's function is: to celebrate himself. But how will you celebrate? You </div>
<div id="tw_94" class="t s1_94">will have to invite others. You will have to ask others to come and participate. </div>
<div id="tx_94" class="t s1_94">Meditation gives you the insight of your own inner treasure, and in love you share it. </div>
<div id="ty_94" class="t s1_94">That's what I mean when I say that a sannyasin has to be ready to be alone -- so that one </div>
<div id="tz_94" class="t s1_94">day he can be ready to love. Only a man who knows the beauties of solitude can love. </div>
<div id="t10_94" class="t s1_94">But just a slight difference and you can miss the whole point. </div>
<div id="t11_94" class="t s1_94">Now, the difference between aloneness and loneliness is not much; as far as language is </div>
<div id="t12_94" class="t s1_94">concerned there is no difference at all, they are synonyms. In the dictionaries you will </div>
<div id="t13_94" class="t s1_94">find aloneness described as loneliness, loneliness as aloneness -- but that is only in the </div>
<div id="t14_94" class="t s1_94">dictionaries, not in life itself. In life itself it is totally different. </div>
<div id="t15_94" class="t s1_94">Don't live through language, don't become too much obsessed with language, because </div>
<div id="t16_94" class="t s1_94">language is only utilitarian. It can mislead you -- it misleads. It can't help it; it has been </div>
<div id="t17_94" class="t s1_94">invented by people who know nothing. I am saying "aloneness" and your mind hears </div>
