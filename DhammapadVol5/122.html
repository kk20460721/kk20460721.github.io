<div id="t1_122" class="t s1_122">He was living with his disciples, a few hundred disciples, in the desert. A few travelers </div>
<div id="t2_122" class="t s1_122">passing by thought just out of curiosity to see what was happening, so they went to the </div>
<div id="t3_122" class="t s1_122">monastery and asked permission. They wanted just to see what was happening and </div>
<div id="t4_122" class="t s1_122">they could not believe their eyes: hundreds of people were looking crazy. Somebody </div>
<div id="t5_122" class="t s1_122">was dancing, somebody was shouting, somebody was talking to the sky, and it was all </div>
<div id="t6_122" class="t s1_122">chaos. They said, "This man, Bahauddin, seems to be insane and he has gathered all </div>
<div id="t7_122" class="t s1_122">kinds of insane people here. What is going on?" And Bahauddin was sitting just in the </div>
<div id="t8_122" class="t s1_122">middle of it all. </div>
<div id="t9_122" class="t s1_122">They went away to their destination. When they were coming back, again out of </div>
<div id="ta_122" class="t s1_122">curiosity they thought, "What is happening now? We should go and see." They went </div>
<div id="tb_122" class="t s1_122">there. Bahauddin was still sitting in the same place and all the disciples who had been </div>
<div id="tc_122" class="t s1_122">shouting and looking crazy just a few months before were all sitting in silence, as if no </div>
<div id="td_122" class="t s1_122">one was there. The monastery was so quiet, so utterly quiet. </div>
<div id="te_122" class="t s1_122">Now they were even more puzzled: "What has happened? Where has all that insanity </div>
<div id="tf_122" class="t s1_122">gone?" Not a single word was uttered by Bahauddin, not a question was asked by the </div>
<div id="tg_122" class="t s1_122">disciples. The spectators remained there for a few minutes and then they went away. </div>
<div id="th_122" class="t s1_122">After a few years they were again passing by and they said, "Now let us see what is </div>
<div id="ti_122" class="t s1_122">happening." They went there; Bahauddin was still sitting in the middle and there was </div>
<div id="tj_122" class="t s1_122">not a single disciple around; the whole monastery was empty. Now they could not </div>
<div id="tk_122" class="t s1_122">contain their curiosity, more so because Bahauddin was alone. They thought, "Why not </div>
<div id="tl_122" class="t s1_122">ask him?" </div>
<div id="tm_122" class="t s1_122">So they asked. "When we first came a few years ago," they said, "all hell was loose, and </div>
<div id="tn_122" class="t s1_122">we thought that you were mad and your followers were mad. What was happening at </div>
<div id="to_122" class="t s1_122">that time?" </div>
<div id="tp_122" class="t s1_122">Bahauddin said, "Catharsis. They were throwing out the insanities that they had </div>
<div id="tq_122" class="t s1_122">gathered in many many lives because of you people, because of a repressive society, </div>
<div id="tr_122" class="t s1_122">because of an insane society. I was allowing them to throw it out, to get rid of it." </div>
<div id="ts_122" class="t s1_122">The people asked, "Then what happened? When we came back they were all silent!" </div>
<div id="tt_122" class="t s1_122">Bahauddin said, "They threw out all that was inside and nothing was left; they became </div>
<div id="tu_122" class="t s1_122">sane. Hence they were sitting in silence." </div>
<div id="tv_122" class="t s1_122">Those people said, "We can understand these two things. But what has happened now? </div>
<div id="tw_122" class="t s1_122">Where have they gone?" </div>
<div id="tx_122" class="t s1_122">Bahauddin said, "Now they have gone to spread the message. Now there is no more for </div>
<div id="ty_122" class="t s1_122">them to do. They have tasted the nectar; now they have gone to the farthest corners of </div>
<div id="tz_122" class="t s1_122">the earth to bring more crazy people. And next time when you come you will again find </div>
<div id="t10_122" class="t s1_122">the same thing happening: crazy people throwing out all their craziness." </div>
<div id="t11_122" class="t s1_122">Jagdeesh is a professor of psychology in Chicago. Go there and bring as many insane </div>
<div id="t12_122" class="t s1_122">people as you can. Help my work. And to help my work is to be with me, to help my </div>
<div id="t13_122" class="t s1_122">work is real intimacy with me. And I will be constantly watching you. </div>
<div id="t14_122" class="t s1_122">Remember, wherever you are, that I am with you. And soon it will not just be an idea, it </div>
<div id="t15_122" class="t s1_122">will become a reality; it IS a reality -- you just have to discover it. And the anti-</div>
