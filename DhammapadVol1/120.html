<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">go on digging deeper and deeper, and you bring things from the unconscious to the </div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">conscious. His presence, his expertise, his name, his authority, make you courageous. </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">You are not afraid of bringing things up which would scare you if you brought them up </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">when you were alone -- because you would see yourself on the verge of going mad. But </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">his authority and his presence...and that may be only in your belief, because he himself </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">may be more insane than you are. But you can have just the belief that he knows that he </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">will be able to help, that he is there, so you need not be afraid; you can go and dig deep </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">into your unconscious. </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">The more you bring to the conscious, the more you are freed -- it is very unburdening. </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">But once, twice or thrice a week you unburden, and the whole week you go on </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">gathering again. The three hours' doing is undone; you remain the same. It becomes a </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">vicious circle. In the society, in the family, you again accumulate repressions, and you </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">go to the analyst and you express those suppressions. A little bit unburdened, you are </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">back in the society -- the same society, the same people. You listen to the same priest, </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">you read the same newspaper, you go to the same political rally. You remain a </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">communist or you remain a Catholic. The same wife, the same husband, the same </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">children, the same people to associate with</div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">....</div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">Again repression happens. </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">This is a very temporary relief. </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">Many other ways are being found. Painting is one of the ways -- far more significant, </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">because the unconscious knows the language of pictures and not the language of words. </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">The unconscious expresses itself in pictures. That's why in your dreams your </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">unconscious expresses itself more adequately. Hence the psychoanalyst wants to know </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">about your dreams more and more. Dreams are a pictorial, primitive language, </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">unsophisticated, more innocent. And that's exactly what happens when you paint. </div>
<div id="ts_120" class="t s1_120">Painting is bringing your dreams out into the light -- it can help tremendously. My own </div>
<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">feeling is that if Picasso had been prevented from painting he would have gone mad. It </div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">was his painting that saved him -- although he was unaware that it was his painting </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">that was saving him. But his painting has the quality of madness in it. </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">If you look at a Picasso painting and meditate over it you will feel dizzy, you will feel </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">uneasy, you will feel tense, you will not feel relaxed. And if you live in a room where on </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">all the walls are Picasso paintings, there is every danger that you will have nightmares, </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">or you may go mad. Those paintings will provoke your insanity. </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">So, Nirgun, you can avoid the art galleries, you can bypass Picassos, but you cannot </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">bypass the aesthetic layer of your being. You cannot bypass the aesthetic dimension; </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">otherwise you will remain impoverished, lopsided, something will be missing in you. </div>
<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">And I would not like anything to be missing in my sannyasins. They have to be as </div>
<div id="t14_120" class="t s1_120">scientific as possible. I don't mean -- again remember -- that you have to become a </div>
<div id="t15_120" class="t s1_120">physicist or a chemist or a biologist or a physiologist. I don't mean that! When I say you </div>
<div id="t16_120" class="t s1_120">have to be a scientist, I mean you have to be scientific -- it is a metaphor. Always </div>
<div id="t17_120" class="t s1_120">remember: I am talking in metaphors and similes and parables. </div>
<div id="t18_120" class="t s1_120">You have to be scientific. To approach the world, the objective world, rightly, the only </div>
<div id="t19_120" class="t s1_120">way is science. If the Bible says that the earth is not round but flat, don't believe in it -- </div>
