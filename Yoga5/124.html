<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">Patanjali never makes you guilty about anything. In that sense he is more </div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">scientific than religious, more a psychologist than a religious priest. He is not a </div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">preacher. Whatsoever he is saying. he i8 simply giving you a blueprint of how to </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">grow; and if you want to grow you need a discipline. The discipline should not </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">be imposed from the outside; otherwise it creates guilt. The discipline should </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">come out of inner understanding, then it is beautiful. The difference is very </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">subtle. You can be told to do something, and then you do it, but you do it like a </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">slave. You can be helped to understand a certain phenomenon: through </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">understanding you do it, then you do it as a master. Whenever you are a master </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">you are beautiful; whenever you are a slave you become ugly. </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">I have heard one old Yiddish joke. There was a tailor named Zumbach. A man </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">came to him. His suit was ready and he had come to take it, but the man found </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">that one sleeve was longer than the other. He started fussing about it. Zumbach </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">the tailor said, "So what? Why are you fussing so much? Look. This is a piece of </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">art, and for just a small defect you are creating so much fuss. You can pull your </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">hand inside a little, and then the sleeve will be okay." </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">So the man tried, but when he pulled his hand inside he felt that a bunch of </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">material had gathered on his back. So he said, "Now this bunch of material has </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">gathered on my back." </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">Said Zumbach the tailor, "So what? You can stoop a little, but this is a piece of art </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">and I am not ready to change it. It looks so beautiful." </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">So the man hunched over and walked out. Just outside when he was going home </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">(it was very difficult to walk because one hand had to be pulled in, and then he </div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s1_124">had to remain hunched over so the suit remains beautiful -- the man is </div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">completely forgotten; the coat has become more important) there came another </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">guy and he said, "Such a beautiful suit. I bet it must have been prepared by </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">Zumbach the tailor." </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">The first man was surprised. He said, "How do you know?" </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">The man said, "How do I know? Only that type of tailor can make such a </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">beautiful suit for a cripple like you." </div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">This is how it has been happening through all the religions to all humanity. They </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">have made beautiful laws for you. "So what?" they say if you have to hunch over </div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">a little. "It's okay. You look so beautiful." It is the law that has to be followed and </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">fulfilled: you are not the end; the law is the end. If you become crippled it is </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">okay, if you become a hunchback it is okay, if you become ill it is okay -- but the </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">law should be fulfilled. </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">Patanjali is not giving you laws of that type, no. He understands more. He </div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">understands the whole situation. The laws are there to help you. They are really </div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">like a structure which is made before you start constructing a building, the </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">scaffold. It helps the new building to come up; once the building is ready the </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">structure has to be taken away. It was for a certain purpose; it was not the end. </div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s1_124">All these laws are for a certain purpose: They help you grow. </div>
