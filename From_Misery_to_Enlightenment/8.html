<div id="t1_8" class="t s1_8">CHAPTER 1. YOUR BIRTHRIGHT: TO TAKE FLIGHT</div>
<div id="t2_8" class="t s2_8">When I went to see him at three o’clock he was perfectly cured. He was laughing, sitting up, enjoying</div>
<div id="t3_8" class="t s2_8">himself; and he said to me, ”Now I am feeling perfectly good, and I think tomorrow I can come home.”</div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s2_8">I could see what was going to happen. He was going home but he was not coming home.</div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s2_8">So I tried to change the subject of home, because it was difﬁcult for me to say, ”Yes, tomorrow you</div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s2_8">are coming home” – because what I was seeing was that he was going home that day. But I said,</div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s2_8">”That is perfectly okay. Why wait for tomorrow? If you are feeling good and there is no problem,</div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s2_8">and the doctor allows it, you can come today.” And I tried to talk about mundane things. I told him,</div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s2_8">”We have brought a new, very big car for you. It has come, and whenever you are ready you will be</div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s2_8">coming home in your own new car.”</div>
<div id="tb_8" class="t s2_8">He was almost childlike as he went deeper into meditation. And he took sannyas only when he had</div>
<div id="tc_8" class="t s2_8">touched the rock bottom of meditation, not before it. People take sannyas to enter into meditation;</div>
<div id="td_8" class="t s2_8">he waited. My mother took sannyas, my uncles took sannyas, but he waited.</div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s2_8">Everybody was asking me, ”Why don’t you tell your father?” My uncle was saying it, my mother</div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s2_8">was saying it. I said, ”He has never told anything to me, never forced me to do anything. Now this</div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s2_8">would be absolutely unfair on my part to tell him to do something – and particularly to take sannyas.</div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s2_8">Whenever he wants, he will say; I am not going to tell him. And I know he is waiting” – because he</div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s2_8">was continuously reporting about his meditation to me: how he was going, what he experienced, for</div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s2_8">how many seconds his thoughts disappeared and what kind of thoughts came when they came.</div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s2_8">Whenever he came to me he was mentioning his meditation – and that was a clear indication that</div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s2_8">he was waiting; until he had touched rock bottom he would not say anything about sannyas. And he</div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s2_8">knew perfectly well that I was not going to say anything.</div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s2_8">One day, in the morning... he used to meditate from three o’clock in the night up to six – three hours.</div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s2_8">So just nearabout six, Laxmi came running and said, ”Your father wants you immediately, and he</div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s2_8">also says,’Bring a mala and the sannyas form.’ I don’t know what has happened to him.” He had</div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s2_8">been sitting for three hours; he was staying in the room where afterwards Laxmi stayed – in Lao Tzu</div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s2_8">house in Poona, the same room. He had just come for a few days, so Laxmi had moved out and he</div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s2_8">was staying there. I went into the room. He said, ”Now the time has come: give me sannyas.</div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s2_8">After that day he became more and more childlike – interested in any small thing, just like a child. But</div>
<div id="tu_8" class="t s2_8">that day when I mentioned, ”We have brought a very big car for you, perhaps the biggest available in</div>
<div id="tv_8" class="t s2_8">India” – and you can ﬁnd the biggest cars in India because elsewhere, all over the world, they have</div>
<div id="tw_8" class="t s2_8">disappeared – ”and now you will not feel any discomfort, any trouble,” he took no notice. That was</div>
<div id="tx_8" class="t s2_8">another indication to me that he was feeling something. I left him after ten minutes and I told him, ”I</div>
<div id="ty_8" class="t s2_8">will inquire of the doctor, and if you are cured then why wait for tomorrow? – you come home today.”</div>
<div id="tz_8" class="t s2_8">When my mother saw him he was looking perfectly well. He said that he wanted to go out and sit</div>
<div id="t10_8" class="t s2_8">on the veranda and just see the outside world. After my leaving they took him out. At that time my</div>
<div id="t11_8" class="t s2_8">mother realized that she had not eaten the whole day. She felt so hungry that she told Sohan, or</div>
<div id="t12_8" class="t s2_8">somebody who was there, ”I am feeling very hungry, my stomach is almost hurting.” She told my</div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s2_8">father, ”Sohan is coming soon with the food so you eat ﬁrst – my stomach is hurting.”</div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s2_8">But my father said, ”I am not feeling like eating. I am feeling so good that I don’t want to disturb my</div>
<div id="t15_8" class="t s2_8">From Misery to Enlightenment</div>
<div id="t16_8" class="t s2_8">8</div>
<div id="t17_8" class="t s3_8">Osho</div>
