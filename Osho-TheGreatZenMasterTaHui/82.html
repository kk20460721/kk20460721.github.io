<div id="t2_82" class="t s1_82">WAY FOR YOU TO USE YOUR MENTAL ARRANGEMENTS.</div>
<div id="t3_82" class="t s1_82">Ta Hui is important for you to understand, because he is a representative of thousands of</div>
<div id="t4_82" class="t s1_82">intellectuals in the world who go on deceiving themselves because they can consistently,</div>
<div id="t5_82" class="t s1_82">logically, think about experiences that have not happened to them. Perhaps they are influenced</div>
<div id="t6_82" class="t s1_82">by people who have actually experienced, and that impact is so great that they start believing</div>
<div id="t7_82" class="t s1_82">that certainly such things happen. Then they are capable of intellectual systematizing -- and</div>
<div id="t8_82" class="t s1_82">they can go on systematizing -- but underneath they don't know a thing.</div>
<div id="t9_82" class="t s1_82">These people are the theologians, these people are religious heads, these people are</div>
<div id="ta_82" class="t s1_82">philosophers, these people are great professors. These people dominate humanity, and they are</div>
<div id="tb_82" class="t s1_82">the wrong people -- wrong because they are dishonest, wrong because they don't accept that it</div>
<div id="tc_82" class="t s1_82">is not their experience. They simply go on fabricating beautiful words and theories and</div>
<div id="td_82" class="t s1_82">creating an illusion in the minds of people that perhaps they are authentic seers, enlightened</div>
<div id="te_82" class="t s1_82">people.</div>
<div id="tf_82" class="t s1_82">I will tell you an actual incident that happened, just at the beginning of this century. One</div>
<div id="tg_82" class="t s1_82">young man, Ramateertha, was a professor of mathematics in Lahore University, and he was</div>
<div id="th_82" class="t s1_82">certainly a genius. He is well known for this incident -- perhaps nobody else has done it this</div>
<div id="ti_82" class="t s1_82">way ... In examinations, the question paper comes with a note, "Answer any five out of the</div>
<div id="tj_82" class="t s1_82">seven questions." When he was a student this was his consistent practice: he would answer all</div>
<div id="tk_82" class="t s1_82">seven questions with a note, "Examine any five questions." He always answered all seven</div>
<div id="tl_82" class="t s1_82">questions exactly right, so there was no problem for him -- you could choose any five</div>
<div id="tm_82" class="t s1_82">yourself, whichever ones you wanted to examine. When he passed his post-graduation -- he</div>
<div id="tn_82" class="t s1_82">topped the university in mathematics, he was a gold medalist -- he was immediately appointed</div>
<div id="to_82" class="t s1_82">as a professor. He had the caliber of a great intellectual. And just then Vivekananda returned</div>
<div id="tp_82" class="t s1_82">from America.</div>
<div id="tq_82" class="t s1_82">Vivekananda was a monk and a disciple of Ramakrishna, who was an enlightened man but</div>
<div id="tr_82" class="t s1_82">uneducated. Ramakrishna was not articulate enough to manage to say something about his</div>
<div id="ts_82" class="t s1_82">experience, so he had chosen Vivekananda, who was a very intelligent person, from the cream</div>
<div id="tt_82" class="t s1_82">of Bengal's intelligentsia. Vivekananda impressed people all over the world, wherever he</div>
<div id="tu_82" class="t s1_82">went; now he had come back from America and was going around India. He came to Lahore,</div>
<div id="tv_82" class="t s1_82">to the university where Ramateertha was a professor, and Ramateertha was so much</div>
<div id="tw_82" class="t s1_82">impressed by Vivekananda that he wanted to be initiated by him immediately.</div>
<div id="tx_82" class="t s1_82">Vivekananda himself was just an intellectual, but a very forceful personality, a very</div>
<div id="ty_82" class="t s1_82">imposing personality. He appealed to Ramateertha immediately because they were both</div>
<div id="tz_82" class="t s1_82">intellectuals, so there was immediately a harmony, a synchronicity between their minds.</div>
<div id="t10_82" class="t s1_82">Vivekananda initiated him into sannyas, and Ramateertha left for a world tour himself.</div>
<div id="t11_82" class="t s1_82">Ramateertha was far more articulate than Vivekananda himself, far more poetic, far more</div>
<div id="t12_82" class="t s1_82">impressive ... not as a personality, because Vivekananda looked like a giant -- he had a huge</div>
<div id="t13_82" class="t s1_82">body -- but Ramateertha seems to have been far superior, intellectually. In particular, he was</div>
<div id="t14_82" class="t s1_82">so much drowned in Persian, Arabic, and Urdu poetry, which are all unique as far as their</div>
<div id="t15_82" class="t s1_82">mysticism is concerned -- they all belong to the Sufi tradition of mystics.</div>
<div id="t16_82" class="t s1_82">So Ramateertha had some new area about which Vivekananda had no knowledge. He also</div>
<div id="t17_82" class="t s1_82">impressed people very much wherever he went. And the problem with the mind is that if</div>
<div id="t18_82" class="t s1_82">people are impressed by you, slowly, slowly, it has a feedback effect. Because they get</div>
