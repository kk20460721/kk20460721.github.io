<div id="t1_338" class="t s1_338">CHAPTER 30. IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE NEW</div>
<div id="t2_338" class="t s2_338">kept Greece at a peak of intelligence, because I don’t think anybody else in the whole of Europe has</div>
<div id="t3_338" class="t s2_338">been able to transcend the sharpness of intelligence that Socrates had. Perhaps his contemporaries</div>
<div id="t4_338" class="t s2_338">have not yet arrived, although twenty-ﬁve centuries have passed.</div>
<div id="t5_338" class="t s2_338">When van Gogh’s paintings were recognized people started searching them out.</div>
<div id="t6_338" class="t s2_338">He must have</div>
<div id="t7_338" class="t s2_338">painted thousands of paintings and just went on giving them away – to friends, as gifts, or for a cup</div>
<div id="t8_338" class="t s2_338">of tea or for a meal. People accepted his paintings just not to look crude, not to look uncivilized.</div>
<div id="t9_338" class="t s2_338">They thought, ”Once he is gone then we can put the painting in the basement. Nobody was hanging</div>
<div id="ta_338" class="t s2_338">his paintings in their sitting rooms, because anybody looking at the paintings would think that this</div>
<div id="tb_338" class="t s2_338">man had gone crazy: why is he putting up this painting?</div>
<div id="tc_338" class="t s2_338">Van Gogh’s ideas looked crazy at the time, but his time came later. His whole family condemned</div>
<div id="td_338" class="t s2_338">him, saying, ”You have not done a single thing and you are a parasite on your younger brother” –</div>
<div id="te_338" class="t s2_338">because his younger brother went on supporting him just enough so that he could survive.</div>
<div id="tf_338" class="t s2_338">Van Gogh could not eat every day of the week; four days he was eating and three days he was</div>
<div id="tg_338" class="t s2_338">fasting – one day eating, one day fasting, one day eating, one day fasting – because with whatever</div>
<div id="th_338" class="t s2_338">he could save from those three days, he would purchase colors, paints, canvasses, brushes for his</div>
<div id="ti_338" class="t s2_338">painting. There was no other way.</div>
<div id="tj_338" class="t s2_338">Nobody has painted with such love and with such joy, with his own life and his own blood.</div>
<div id="tk_338" class="t s2_338">He</div>
<div id="tl_338" class="t s2_338">destroyed himself in painting. Now there is so much search going on in the basements of Holland</div>
<div id="tm_338" class="t s2_338">and Italy where he lived; his paintings have been found in people’s basements, and now the prices</div>
<div id="tn_338" class="t s2_338">of those paintings are unbelievable.</div>
<div id="to_338" class="t s2_338">The last one was sold the day before yesterday for forty million dollars. When the painting was sold</div>
<div id="tp_338" class="t s2_338">a few months ago the critics were saying, ”This is the end; nobody can purchase any painting for</div>
<div id="tq_338" class="t s2_338">a higher price than this.” He had set a record – fourteen million dollars. Before this, the record had</div>
<div id="tr_338" class="t s2_338">been only three million dollars for somebody else’s painting. But this was a big jump, to fourteen</div>
<div id="ts_338" class="t s2_338">million, and within three or four months another of his paintings went for forty million dollars – and I</div>
<div id="tt_338" class="t s2_338">can conceive that the price of his paintings may go still higher.</div>
<div id="tu_338" class="t s2_338">Just now two hundred more paintings have been found and those, too, not in good condition. Now,</div>
<div id="tv_338" class="t s2_338">this man was one of the greatest creators the world has known, but he was not a doer, he was not</div>
<div id="tw_338" class="t s2_338">a producer. If he had even had any skill – carpentry or shoemaking or tailoring – he would have</div>
<div id="tx_338" class="t s2_338">earned enough and everybody would have respected him as a man who earns his living. But he</div>
<div id="ty_338" class="t s2_338">was continuously condemned for being absolutely lazy, and nobody knew what he was doing.</div>
<div id="tz_338" class="t s2_338">The whole day would pass and he would forget completely about eating or even drinking water, he</div>
<div id="t10_338" class="t s2_338">was so absorbed in his painting. Only when the night would descend and it would become difﬁcult to</div>
<div id="t11_338" class="t s2_338">see, then he would recognize that the day was gone. He was so poor he could not even manage to</div>
<div id="t12_338" class="t s2_338">purchase a few candles; he used to paint outside his house sometimes in the night under the street</div>
<div id="t13_338" class="t s2_338">lamp.</div>
<div id="t14_338" class="t s2_338">His brother must have been sensitive. He was young and certainly he understood something about</div>
<div id="t15_338" class="t s2_338">paintings because he was working as a salesman in a shop where paintings and other pieces of art</div>
<div id="t16_338" class="t s2_338">were sold. So he had a certain understanding, and he loved his brother, but what could he do? He</div>
<div id="t17_338" class="t s2_338">himself was a poor man, somehow surviving, and more than that was not possible for him.</div>
<div id="t18_338" class="t s2_338">Satyam Shivam Sundram</div>
<div id="t19_338" class="t s2_338">338</div>
<div id="t1a_338" class="t s3_338">Osho</div>
