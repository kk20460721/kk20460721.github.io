<div id="t1_131" class="t s1_131">CHAPTER 20.</div>
<div id="t2_131" class="t s2_131">The old university gate was poor, really poor. It was made when the university was just beginning</div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s2_131">and they were not able to create a monumental structure. We all lived in military barracks because</div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s2_131">the university had started so suddenly and there had been no time to make hostels or libraries. It</div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s2_131">was just an abandoned military barracks. But the place itself was beautiful, situated on a small hill.</div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s2_131">The military had abandoned it because it had only been meaningful during the second world war.</div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s2_131">It was at a height they had needed for their radar, to look around for the enemy. Now there was no</div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s2_131">need, so they abandoned it. It was a blessing, at least for me, because I would not have been able</div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s2_131">to read and study in any university other than that.</div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s2_131">Its name was the University of Sagar. Sagar means ”ocean.” Sagar has a tremendously beautiful</div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s2_131">lake, so big that it is not called a lake, but sagar, an ocean. It really looks like an ocean, with waves</div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s2_131">rising on it.</div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s2_131">One cannot believe that it is only a lake.</div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s2_131">I have seen only two lakes with such big</div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s2_131">waves. Not that I have only seen two lakes, I have seen many. I have seen the most beautiful lakes</div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s2_131">of Kashmir, the Himalayas, Darjeeling, Nainital, and many others in the south of India, in the Nandi</div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s2_131">Hills, but I have seen only two with waves which resemble the ocean: the lake of Sagar and the lake</div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s2_131">of Bhopal.</div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s2_131">Compared to Bhopal, of course the lake of Sagar is small. The lake of Bhopal is perhaps the greatest</div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s2_131">in the whole world. In that lake I have seen waves that can only be described as tidal waves, rising</div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s2_131">maybe twelve or ﬁfteen feet high. No other lake can claim that. It is so vast. I once tried to go around</div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s2_131">it in a boat, and it took seventeen days. I was going as fast as you can imagine; more so, because</div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s2_131">there were no policemen around, and no speed limit. By the time I had ended the tour I simply said</div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s2_131">to myself, ”My God, what a beautiful lake!” And it was hundreds of feet deep.</div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s2_131">The same is true, on a smaller scale, of the lake of Sagar; but in another sense it has a beauty</div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s2_131">which the lake of Bhopal does not possess. It is surrounded by beautiful mountains, not so vast but</div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s2_131">tremendously beautiful... particularly in the early morning, at sunrise and in the evening, at sunset.</div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s2_131">And if it is a full moon night you really know what beauty is. In a small boat on that lake, on a full</div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s2_131">moon night, one simply feels that nothing more is needed.</div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s2_131">It is a beautiful place... but I still feel bad because the old gate is no longer there. It was bound to</div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s2_131">be dismantled. I am absolutely aware of that, not only now; even then everyone was aware that it</div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s2_131">needed to be dismantled. It was only temporary, made just to inaugurate the university.</div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s2_131">This was the second gate I remember. When I left university I was standing by the gate with my old</div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s2_131">professor, Sri Krishna Saxena. The poor man died just a few days ago, and he had sent a message</div>
<div id="tz_131" class="t s2_131">saying he wanted to see me. I would have loved to see him, but now nothing can be done unless he</div>
<div id="t10_131" class="t s2_131">is born quickly, and to a sannyasin, so that he can reach me. I will recognize him immediately, that</div>
<div id="t11_131" class="t s2_131">much I can promise.</div>
<div id="t12_131" class="t s2_131">He was a man of exceptional qualities. He was the only professor out of the whole lot that I came</div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s2_131">across – teachers, lecturers, readers, professors and whatnot – he was the only one who was able</div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s2_131">to understand that he had a student who should rather have been his Master.</div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s2_131">He was standing at the gate persuading me not to leave the university. He was saying, ”You should</div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s2_131">not leave, particularly when the university has granted you a Ph.D. scholarship. You should not lose</div>
<div id="t17_131" class="t s2_131">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t18_131" class="t s2_131">131</div>
<div id="t19_131" class="t s3_131">Osho</div>
