<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">CHAPTER 7. THE MINES OF MEDITATION</div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s2_124">But then the the thought is very frightening! For if you begin to be authentic, the house you made</div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s2_124">within the resting place will begin to crumble. It is but a halt in your journey; that you have made it</div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s2_124">your permanent abode is the biggest lie. You have set out in a paper boat to sail across the sea of</div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s2_124">existence. How will you sail? You will have to remain sitting on the shore, for it is too dangerous to</div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s2_124">lower such a boat into the water. No sooner does it touch water than it will be no more; the paper</div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s2_124">will dissolve.</div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s2_124">People come to me worrying that life will become difﬁcult if they begin to be authentic. Yes, it will!</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s2_124">Because you have based your lives on falsity. It will be really difﬁcult in the beginning. If you do</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s2_124">not change, then too it is difﬁcult; for what happiness have you attained in your life, what ﬂowers</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s2_124">have bloomed in your life, what fragrance have you experienced? What is there in your life, on the</div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s2_124">strength of which you can say that your life has been worth living? There is nothing. And you know</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s2_124">it.</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s2_124">Life as it is is no less difﬁcult, but you have become addicted to it. When you turn towards truth, your</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s2_124">old habits will break. Right now when a person you detest visits you say, ”Welcome. I am so pleased</div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s2_124">that you have come.” But inside yourself you curse the day for bringing such a person to your door.</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s2_124">Now your day is ruined.</div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s2_124">If he is even a little intelligent, a little aware, he will see the lie behind your words. No matter what</div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s2_124">your lips pronounce, your eyes give you away. Your face, your movements will be very different from</div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s2_124">your words. They will have nothing in common. When a person is truly happy he does not go about</div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s2_124">declaring his happiness; every pore of his body is ﬁlled with joy and cheer. You can make out a</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s2_124">person who is really happy. But alas, the other man is also asleep. You think you really mean what</div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s2_124">you say. This is why ﬂattery pays in the world. The listener can always detect the deception in your</div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s2_124">words if he listens carefully.</div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s2_124">The English poet Yeats was given a Nobel Prize. He was a genuine person, simple and artless. His</div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s2_124">works were ﬁlled with his authenticity. When a meeting was held to congratulate him on winning</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s2_124">this much coveted prize, the usual occurred for such a meeting: people began to praise him and</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s2_124">his works very profusely. Even those who had criticized him before were now singing his praises.</div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s2_124">He was very disturbed and perplexed to see the sham, for he knew that all that was being said was</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s2_124">never meant. He began to shrivel up in his chair.</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s2_124">When the speeches were over he was sitting in his chair, cowered and shrunken as if all this was</div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s2_124">beyond his endurance. The chairman shook him and said, ”Are you asleep? Did you hear what I</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s2_124">have just announced?” A purse of 25,000 pounds was offered him as a gift by his colleagues. Yeats</div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s2_124">replied, ”I am not asleep, but had I known all this would happen I would not have come. To have</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s2_124">to listen to such blatant lies for two full hours for the sake of a mere 25,000 pounds, I would never,</div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s2_124">never have come!”</div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s2_124">If you have cultivated even the slightest awareness, no one will be able to ﬂatter you, for you shall</div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s2_124">see the falsity in his expression. But you lack awareness; people all around you pronounce lies and</div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s2_124">you are not the least aware of it. You yourself are speaking untruths without any awareness of what</div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s2_124">you are doing. Then you get caught in a thousand difﬁculties. In your moment of unawareness you</div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s2_124">tell a woman, ”You are so beautiful; I am in love with you.” – and land in trouble. Perhaps at that very</div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s2_124">moment you know that it was a lie but now a whole series of problems begin. You regret it the very</div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s2_124">next day.</div>
<div id="t18_124" class="t s2_124">The True Name, Vol 2</div>
