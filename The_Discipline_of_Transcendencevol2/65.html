<div id="t2_65" class="t s1_65">so surrendered that it is now natural for him. </div>
<div id="t3_65" class="t s1_65">Not to desire has become as natural to him as it is natural ordinarily to desire. </div>
<div id="t4_65" class="t s1_65">Not to be ambitious has become as natural as it is natural for people to be </div>
<div id="t5_65" class="t s1_65">ambitious. People are habitually in discord with the way, and he becomes </div>
<div id="t6_65" class="t s1_65">naturally in accord. </div>
<div id="t7_65" class="t s1_65">Pythagoras calls this state harmonia. That is the right word -- in accord. </div>
<div id="t8_65" class="t s1_65">Harmonia, in harmony</div>
<div id="t9_65" class="t s1_65">....</div>
<div id="ta_65" class="t s1_65">Lao Tzu calls this tao. Buddha calls it dhamma. </div>
<div id="tb_65" class="t s1_65">To be in accord... as if you are not swimming, not struggling; you are completely </div>
<div id="tc_65" class="t s1_65">relaxed and floating with the river. You are so one with the river that there is not </div>
<div id="td_65" class="t s1_65">even a slight distance between you and the river.You don't have any of your </div>
<div id="te_65" class="t s1_65">desires, you don't have any private goals. You go with the river to the ocean. </div>
<div id="tf_65" class="t s1_65">A man of harmonia, accord, tao, dhamma, is the most beautiful flowering in this </div>
<div id="tg_65" class="t s1_65">world. He is the lotus flower of consciousness. </div>
<div id="th_65" class="t s1_65">GREAT IS THE HEART THAT IS IN ACCORD WITH THE WAY. </div>
<div id="ti_65" class="t s1_65">But it cannot happen immediately. First you will have to discipline, and then you </div>
<div id="tj_65" class="t s1_65">will have to drop discipline also. First you will have to make it a point to relax, </div>
<div id="tk_65" class="t s1_65">and then you will have to forget relaxation also. First you will have to fight with </div>
<div id="tl_65" class="t s1_65">your old, ingrained habits, and once you have got over them, you have to drop </div>
<div id="tm_65" class="t s1_65">new habits that you must have created in fighting with the old. First you have to </div>
<div id="tn_65" class="t s1_65">meditate, then one day you have to drop meditation also. </div>
<div id="to_65" class="t s1_65">Meditation is good. Dropping of meditation is great. Being a saint is good, being </div>
<div id="tp_65" class="t s1_65">holy is great. Being a good person is good, but not great. Because a good person </div>
<div id="tq_65" class="t s1_65">still carries a subtle fight with the bad. He is constantly conflicting with the devil, </div>
<div id="tr_65" class="t s1_65">with the evil inside himself. He is not at ease, he cannot relax. He knows that if </div>
<div id="ts_65" class="t s1_65">he relaxes, the old, the past, is big and powerful and he will be possessed, and he </div>
<div id="tt_65" class="t s1_65">will be thrown off balance. He has to continuously balance himself. A good man, </div>
<div id="tu_65" class="t s1_65">a saint, is still not in absolute accord. He is trying hard, he is trying his best, and </div>
<div id="tv_65" class="t s1_65">it should be appreciated that he is trying -- that's why Buddha calls him good. </div>
<div id="tw_65" class="t s1_65">So never be satisfied by good. Remember, to be great is the goal... to be so deeply </div>
<div id="tx_65" class="t s1_65">in accord that you simply disappear and only the dhamma remains, only the tao </div>
<div id="ty_65" class="t s1_65">remains, only the nature remains. You are just a wave in the ocean and you don't </div>
<div id="tz_65" class="t s1_65">exist separately. Your separate existence, your self, has to be dropped. </div>
<div id="t10_65" class="t s1_65">The bad man has a self. The self is created by fighting against the law, against </div>
<div id="t11_65" class="t s1_65">nature. The bad man has a self. He creates the self by fighting against dhamma. </div>
<div id="t12_65" class="t s1_65">Whatsoever is good, he fights against it and creates a self. The good man also has </div>
<div id="t13_65" class="t s1_65">a self. He fights against his bad habits that he has created in the past. Because of </div>
<div id="t14_65" class="t s1_65">fight, he has also a self. </div>
<div id="t15_65" class="t s1_65">The bad man has an ego, the good man has an ego. The bad man's ego is based </div>
<div id="t16_65" class="t s1_65">on his mischief. The good man's ego is based on his virtue. But both have egos. </div>
