<div id="t2_142" class="t s1_142">are not a miser, you become more insecure. If you cling to money, to things, you </div>
<div id="t3_142" class="t s1_142">feel a certain security: at least there is something to ding to; you don't feel empty. </div>
<div id="t4_142" class="t s1_142">Maybe you are full of rubbish; but at least something is there, you are not empty. </div>
<div id="t5_142" class="t s1_142">You go on clinging. With negativity you feel powerful. Whenever you say no, </div>
<div id="t6_142" class="t s1_142">you feel powerful; the ego is enhanced. Whenever you say yes, you feel humble; </div>
<div id="t7_142" class="t s1_142">the ego is destroyed. That's why you don't want to say yes, and you go on saying </div>
<div id="t8_142" class="t s1_142">no. When you love, you become humble; when you are angry, you become </div>
<div id="t9_142" class="t s1_142">powerful. Have you watched? When you are angry, you have four times more </div>
<div id="ta_142" class="t s1_142">energy than you ordinarily have. In anger, in rage, you can throw a rock, a big </div>
<div id="tb_142" class="t s1_142">rock. Ordinarily, if somebody tells you to, you cannot even push it, you cannot </div>
<div id="tc_142" class="t s1_142">even move it. When you are angry, you have much power. When you are loving, </div>
<div id="td_142" class="t s1_142">all power disappears. </div>
<div id="te_142" class="t s1_142">Can you find a more humble man than Jesus, more powerless than Jesus </div>
<div id="tf_142" class="t s1_142">crucified? Just think of him. The people had gathered, the crowd was waiting: he </div>
<div id="tg_142" class="t s1_142">would do some miracle -- he will prove that he is powerful, that he is the son of </div>
<div id="th_142" class="t s1_142">God -- this is the right moment and the right opportunity to prove it. But the </div>
<div id="ti_142" class="t s1_142">crowd was very much disappointed. Nothing happened. Jesus simply prayed. </div>
<div id="tj_142" class="t s1_142">Who had come to listen to the prayer? Jesus simply said, "Father, forgive these </div>
<div id="tk_142" class="t s1_142">people, because they don't know what they are doing." He simply showed his </div>
<div id="tl_142" class="t s1_142">love; and people had come to see his anger, people had come to see power. He </div>
<div id="tm_142" class="t s1_142">will destroy everything; he will take over all power; he will become the high </div>
<div id="tn_142" class="t s1_142">priest of the temple, or he will become the ruler of the country. He will become </div>
<div id="to_142" class="t s1_142">the King. </div>
<div id="tp_142" class="t s1_142">They had come to see power, and what they saw was just simple humbleness -- a </div>
<div id="tq_142" class="t s1_142">humble man, a poor man, crucified -- just praying. But that was the miracle. The </div>
<div id="tr_142" class="t s1_142">greatest miracle that has ever happened on this earth happened that day. Being </div>
<div id="ts_142" class="t s1_142">murdered and killed, he could still pray. That is the miracle. He could still pray </div>
<div id="tt_142" class="t s1_142">for these people to be forgiven, because he knew they didn't know what they </div>
<div id="tu_142" class="t s1_142">were doing; they were ignorant. "They are not doing, Father, knowingly; they are </div>
<div id="tv_142" class="t s1_142">almost fast asleep, snoring. They are doing something unconsciously, so they are </div>
<div id="tw_142" class="t s1_142">not responsible. Don't punish them." </div>
<div id="tx_142" class="t s1_142">This prayer was the miracle. This is where Jesus is, the heart of Jesus. But when </div>
<div id="ty_142" class="t s1_142">you say no, you feel powerful; whenever you are angry, you feel powerful. </div>
<div id="tz_142" class="t s1_142">Hatred is powerful, love is meek. And Jesus says, "Blessed are the meek." Blessed </div>
<div id="t10_142" class="t s1_142">are the meek? Nobody wants to be meek. Hatred seems to be powerful. Have </div>
<div id="t11_142" class="t s1_142">you watched two countries at war, how powerful they become when they are at </div>
<div id="t12_142" class="t s1_142">war? Everybody is vibrant with power. When countries are at peace, the power </div>
<div id="t13_142" class="t s1_142">disappears. When two persons love each other, the egos disappear; there is no </div>
<div id="t14_142" class="t s1_142">power. Two persons in deep love are blessed, but they are meek, delicate. Love is </div>
<div id="t15_142" class="t s1_142">fragile like a flower. Hatred is powerful like a sword. </div>
<div id="t16_142" class="t s1_142">So whenever you are negative, you feel powerful. And if you still want to feel </div>
<div id="t17_142" class="t s1_142">powerful, you will cling to your negativity. Don't throw the responsibility on to </div>
