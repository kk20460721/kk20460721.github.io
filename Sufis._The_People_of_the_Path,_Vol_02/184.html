<div id="t1_184" class="t s1_184">CHAPTER 11. THE ROYAL WAY</div>
<div id="t2_184" class="t s2_184">Just a few days ago, I received a letter from a woman. She had been here, then she went home.</div>
<div id="t3_184" class="t s2_184">For six months she was trying and trying to meditate and it did not happen according to her idea of</div>
<div id="t4_184" class="t s2_184">meditation. She must have had some desire about what it should be like. She must have had some</div>
<div id="t5_184" class="t s2_184">expectations, and it was not happening.</div>
<div id="t6_184" class="t s2_184">She has written a letter to say that one day she was just sitting in the room. There was nothing to do.</div>
<div id="t7_184" class="t s2_184">The husband had gone to the ofﬁce; the children had gone to school; the house was empty. She was</div>
<div id="t8_184" class="t s2_184">just sitting, not doing anything, there was no desire to do. She was just sitting in the chair with closed</div>
<div id="t9_184" class="t s2_184">eyes – and it happened. It was suddenly there, with all its benedictions. But she became frightened.</div>
<div id="ta_184" class="t s2_184">She became frightened because when it happened suddenly a fear came to her – because it was</div>
<div id="tb_184" class="t s2_184">there, meditation was there, but she was not there. That became a great fear and she simply pulled</div>
<div id="tc_184" class="t s2_184">herself out of it. It felt as if she was disappearing.</div>
<div id="td_184" class="t s2_184">Yes, it happens. Your ego cannot exist there. Your ego is not possible there. Your ego is nothing but</div>
<div id="te_184" class="t s2_184">all your tensions together. Your ego is nothing but a bundle of past tensions, of present tensions,</div>
<div id="tf_184" class="t s2_184">and of future tensions. When you are non-tense, the ego simply falls to the ground in pieces.</div>
<div id="tg_184" class="t s2_184">She became afraid. For six months she had been trying to meditate and nothing was happening,</div>
<div id="th_184" class="t s2_184">and then one day it happened. It came while she was completely unaware of it. She was taken</div>
<div id="ti_184" class="t s2_184">aback. It was there. And she had been provoking it and desiring and asking and praying, and it had</div>
<div id="tj_184" class="t s2_184">not come. And then it came. But she missed. It was there but she became frightened. It was too</div>
<div id="tk_184" class="t s2_184">much. She felt as if she might disappear into it and might not be able to come out of it. She pulled</div>
<div id="tl_184" class="t s2_184">herself out of it. Now she writes that she is crying and weeping, and wants it back.</div>
<div id="tm_184" class="t s2_184">Now this wanting it back won’t help – because it came that day without any wanting. Without any</div>
<div id="tn_184" class="t s2_184">idea of what was going to happen, suddenly it came. It always comes like sudden lightning.</div>
<div id="to_184" class="t s2_184">This is the fourth way, that’s why it is called RAJA yoga – the royal path. The king is not supposed</div>
<div id="tp_184" class="t s2_184">to do anything. Servants do. The king is not supposed to do anything. He simply sits on his throne</div>
<div id="tq_184" class="t s2_184">and things happen. There are so many people to do it. That’s why it is called RAJA yoga – the path</div>
<div id="tr_184" class="t s2_184">of the king. The other three are ordinary; the fourth is really exceptional. The king is not expected</div>
<div id="ts_184" class="t s2_184">to do anything; he simply sits there relaxed. That’s what we mean by one who is a king. Doing has</div>
<div id="tt_184" class="t s2_184">disappeared, knowing has disappeared, feeling has disappeared – the king is utterly relaxed. In that</div>
<div id="tu_184" class="t s2_184">relaxation it happens.</div>
<div id="tv_184" class="t s2_184">Suﬁ and Zen are RAJA yogas – the royal paths. Neither consciousness changes the content nor</div>
<div id="tw_184" class="t s2_184">the content changes consciousness. This is the fundamental principle: nothing changes, there is no</div>
<div id="tx_184" class="t s2_184">change happening. Things are. The ﬂower is there and you are there. You don’t change the ﬂower</div>
<div id="ty_184" class="t s2_184">and the ﬂower does not change you. Both exist together. It is existence with no motive.</div>
<div id="tz_184" class="t s2_184">Zen people call it nirvana, the goal, the no-goal – nirvana.</div>
<div id="t10_184" class="t s2_184">One simply ceases to be.</div>
<div id="t11_184" class="t s2_184">the word</div>
<div id="t12_184" class="t s2_184">’nirvana’ is beautiful. It means: as if somebody has blown out a candle. Just a few minutes before</div>
<div id="t13_184" class="t s2_184">it was there, the lamp was burning bright, and then you blew it out. Now the ﬂame has disappeared</div>
<div id="t14_184" class="t s2_184">into the inﬁnity. It has become part of the cosmos. You cannot ﬁnd it. You cannot trace where it has</div>
<div id="t15_184" class="t s2_184">gone, where it is. It has simply disappeared.</div>
<div id="t16_184" class="t s2_184">There is a Suﬁ parable.</div>
<div id="t17_184" class="t s2_184">Suﬁs: The People of the Path, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t18_184" class="t s2_184">184</div>
<div id="t19_184" class="t s3_184">Osho</div>
