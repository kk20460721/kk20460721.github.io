<div id="t1_36" class="t s1_36">unawakened are many and the awakened is one. And all the unawakened feel a certain </div>
<div id="t2_36" class="t s1_36">humiliation in the presence of the awakened. They feel as if his presence proves to them </div>
<div id="t3_36" class="t s1_36">that they have not risen to their real heights, that they have wasted their lives. Rather </div>
<div id="t4_36" class="t s1_36">than rising to their heights they would like to remove the presence of the awakened one </div>
<div id="t5_36" class="t s1_36">so that they can feel at ease. You always feel at ease with people who are just like you; </div>
<div id="t6_36" class="t s1_36">their presence does not in any way make you feel inferior. The presence of a Buddha </div>
<div id="t7_36" class="t s1_36">makes you feel inferior and you are bound to take revenge. It is a battle, and a buddha </div>
<div id="t8_36" class="t s1_36">has to be like an elephant who endures the shafts in a battle. </div>
<div id="t9_36" class="t s1_36">FOR MANY PEOPLE SPEAK WILDLY</div>
<div id="ta_36" class="t s1_36">....</div>
<div id="tb_36" class="t s1_36">Not only will their words be hard, they will </div>
<div id="tc_36" class="t s1_36">be almost wild, mad. I know it from my own experience. </div>
<div id="td_36" class="t s1_36">For twenty years I was traveling around this country. I have encountered all kinds of </div>
<div id="te_36" class="t s1_36">wild people. It was necessary to invite them, it was necessary to choose my people from </div>
<div id="tf_36" class="t s1_36">the crowds, hence I had to go. But the way they were behaving was really strange. I was </div>
<div id="tg_36" class="t s1_36">not harming them; I was simply telling them to wake up in a thousand and one ways, </div>
<div id="th_36" class="t s1_36">but they were throwing stones at me, they were disturbing my meetings, they were </div>
<div id="ti_36" class="t s1_36">preventing me from entering their towns. They were preventing me from getting down </div>
<div id="tj_36" class="t s1_36">from the train in their towns. They were doing all kinds of things... they were really </div>
<div id="tk_36" class="t s1_36">wild for no reason at all. </div>
<div id="tl_36" class="t s1_36">They are still doing it, although I don't go to their towns; although I never move </div>
<div id="tm_36" class="t s1_36">anywhere now, they are still behaving in a wild way. Strange things they go on saying -</div>
<div id="tn_36" class="t s1_36">- and not only saying, but believing. And now it is not only in India that they are saying </div>
<div id="to_36" class="t s1_36">hard words about me, it is almost all over the world. </div>
<div id="tp_36" class="t s1_36">Just yesterday I received an article published in London. They say that I brainwash </div>
<div id="tq_36" class="t s1_36">people here and when their brains are washed away completely, then the men are sent </div>
<div id="tr_36" class="t s1_36">for smuggling jobs and the women are sent for prostitution. That's what I am doing to </div>
<div id="ts_36" class="t s1_36">you, so beware! Once your brain is washed completely these two alternatives are left. </div>
<div id="tt_36" class="t s1_36">And the man who writes it, writes it with great confidence as if he knows. </div>
<div id="tu_36" class="t s1_36">Just the other day I received a news from Bombay. A sannyasin has come across a few </div>
<div id="tv_36" class="t s1_36">photographs in a studio. The sannyasin could see in the pictures somebody who looks </div>
<div id="tw_36" class="t s1_36">like me. At the first glance he was shocked; when he looked closely then he could see </div>
<div id="tx_36" class="t s1_36">that it was somebody else, but with some similarity. Now, they have bribed this man to </div>
<div id="ty_36" class="t s1_36">be naked among naked women, and they have taken his pictures, and now they are </div>
<div id="tz_36" class="t s1_36">going to publish them all over the world. Great idea! I really loved it. Some </div>
<div id="t10_36" class="t s1_36">imagination. </div>
<div id="t11_36" class="t s1_36">But this is how they have been doing always. And I am not saying that they do it </div>
<div id="t12_36" class="t s1_36">knowingly. No, they may be thinking that they are serving humanity, they are making </div>
<div id="t13_36" class="t s1_36">people aware of the danger that I am. They may have every good intention behind all </div>
<div id="t14_36" class="t s1_36">these things; that makes it more complex. They are simply servants of humanity. </div>
<div id="t15_36" class="t s1_36">Buddha says: FOR MANY PEOPLE SPEAK WILDLY. </div>
<div id="t16_36" class="t s1_36">So if you want to live in this world and be awakened you will have to be ready to accept </div>
<div id="t17_36" class="t s1_36">their hard words, their wild actions patiently, silently, with a deep understanding that </div>
<div id="t18_36" class="t s1_36">what can they do? Whatsoever they can do they are doing. It is not their fault, they are </div>
<div id="t19_36" class="t s1_36">simply asleep, and in their sleep they are saying absurd things. </div>
