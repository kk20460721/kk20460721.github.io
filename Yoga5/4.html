<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">because a thief can also come across the owner, but he will be asleep. He can also </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">see the face, but only in the dark because he is afraid, always afraid something </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">may go wrong. He is a thief and is always afraid and trembling. But when you </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">come to the house as a guest -- invited, you have earned it -- the host embraces </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">you; there is welcome. Then you know the very center of the reality. </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">In India we have two words, both mean "the poet." In no other language are </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">there two words for poet, because there is no need; one word is enough. It </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">explains the phenomenon of poetry -- "poet" is enough. But in Sanskrit we have </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">two words, kavi and rishi, and the distinction is very subtle and is worth </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">understanding. Kavi is one: he is a poet who has come as a thief. He participates, </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">so he is a poet, but his knowledge is in fragments. In certain moments.. as if the </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">thief was inside the house and there was sudden lightning in the sky and he </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">could see the whole house from the inside also -- but it is for a single moment. </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">The lightning gone.. everything has become like a dream. </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">The poet comes across the reality sometimes, but as if he has not earned it. That's </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">why you will sometimes be surprised: you read a poem by somebody -- X, Y, Z -- </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">it appeals to you, to your very heart, you are stirred and you would like to meet </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">this man out of whom these lines have flown, but when you meet the man, the </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">poet, you are disappointed -- he is just plain, ordinary, nothing. </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">In the flight of his poetry he was so extraordinary, but if you meet the poet he is </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">ordinary. What has happened? You cannot believe that such a beautiful gem can </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">come out of such an ordinary man It is because a poet is not a permanent </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">resident of the temple. He is a thief. Sometimes he enters, but in the dark. Better </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">than just roaming around and around; at least he has a glimpse. He sings about </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">that glimpse -- continuously there is a nostalgia in his being for the interiormost </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">glimpse that he has attained. He sings about it again and again, but it is no </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">longer his experience now. It is somewhere in the past, a memory, a </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">remembrance, not a reality. </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">The rishi is the poet who has been received as a guest. The word rishi means "a </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">seer," and the word kavi also means "a seer" -- they both mean: one who has </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">seen. Then what is the difference? The difference is that the rishi has earned it. </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">He entered the house in the full light of the day; he entered from the front door. </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">He was not an uninvited guest; he was not trespassing on anybody else's </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">property. He was welcomed. The host received him. Now he also sings, but his </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">singing is totally different from ordinary poetry. The Upanishads are such a </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">poetry, the Vedas are such a poetry -- they are out of the hearts of rishis. They </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">were not ordinary poets. They were extraordinary poets -- extraordinary in the </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">sense that they had earned the glimpse; it was not a stolen thing. </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">But this is possible only when you learn how to participate totally -- that's what </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">yoga is. Yoga means meeting; yoga means marriage; yoga means union. Yoga </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">means: how to come together again -- how to dissolve the separation, how to </div>
