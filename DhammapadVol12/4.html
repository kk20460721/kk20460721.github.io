<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">so that I don't miss him.'" </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">A real man? Is he so rare? Alexander must have brooded over it. He must have thought, </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">"I am a real man. Let me go and see this Diogenes." He had heard many stories about </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">him: "He seems to be the most blissful person in the world. Nobody has ever seen him </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">in anxiety, in anguish, in fear; he is utterly fearless." </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">Alexander had heard that once he was caught by a few people -- eight people were </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">needed to catch this simple man -- but he told them, "Don't make so much effort, you </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">need not. What do you want? Simply tell me." </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">They said, "We want to sell you in the slave market." </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">He said, "Then there is no need to strain yourselves so much -- I hate to give trouble to </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">anybody. I am coming with you." </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">And he went with them, ahead of them. They followed him as if they were his </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">followers. And when they reached the market where men were sold and purchased, </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">everybody was attracted towards this beautiful man. He stood there on a platform and </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">shouted, "Listen, all you slaves who have gathered here: a master is being sold! Is there </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">any slave interested in purchasing a master?" </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">So many stories were in the air about Diogenes... Alexander slowly slowly became so </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">interested that he went to see him. The very interest shows that there was some deep </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">feeling in him about the futility of his own endeavors to conquer the world. And seeing </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">Diogenes he immediately felt himself a nonentity, while Diogenes was an authentic </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">being. Still he tried to laugh it away. </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">Diogenes said, "Stop laughing! Don't try to befool yourself! You can see the fact that you </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">are missing life." </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">And Alexander said, "Yes, sir, I can feel it. For the first time I have seen a really alive </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">person. What can I do for you? I have enough money, I can do anything. Just you say </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">and it will be done." </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">Diogenes said, "I don't need anything. You may have all the money in the world, but I </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">don't have any desire, so all your money is absolutely irrelevant. But one thing you can </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">do is stand aside, because you are blocking the sun. That's all that I can ask from you </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">and you will be kind enough if you can stand aside." </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">He didn't ask for anything. Alexander said to him, "If I have to come into the world </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">another time, I will ask God to make me Diogenes instead of Alexander the Great." </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">Diogenes said, "Why wait for the next life? You can be Diogenes right now! Can't you </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">see the point?" he said. "Nothing is needed to be a Diogenes. You are making so much </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">effort to conquer the world and even if you succeed, what are you going to gain out of </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">it? You will be as miserable as ever, in fact far more miserable, because right now your </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">mind is occupied with the idea, with the ambition of conquering the world. Once you </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">have conquered it you will be at a loss what to do. Better stop now!" </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">Alexander said, "I can understand -- you are right -- but I cannot stop in the middle of </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">my journey. I have decided to conquer the world." </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">Diogenes said, "Then go, don't stop -- but death will stop you in the middle. It always </div>
<div id="t17_4" class="t s1_4">stops everybody in the middle, and then you cannot do anything. Then you will </div>
