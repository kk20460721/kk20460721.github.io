<div id="t1_15" class="t s1_15">Buddha's disciple Anand was present in all the three situations. He became </div>
<div id="t2_15" class="t s1_15">confused. Those three persons didn't know anything about the two other </div>
<div id="t3_15" class="t s1_15">answers that Buddha had given, but Anand was present in all the three </div>
<div id="t4_15" class="t s1_15">situations. When Buddha was going to lie down on the bed in the night Anand </div>
<div id="t5_15" class="t s1_15">said, "One question. Why did you answer the same question in three ways, </div>
<div id="t6_15" class="t s1_15">inconsistent, contradictory?" </div>
<div id="t7_15" class="t s1_15">Buddha said, "I have not given any answer to you -- you need not worry. You </div>
<div id="t8_15" class="t s1_15">can ask your question and I will answer you. Those answers were not given to </div>
<div id="t9_15" class="t s1_15">you. Who are you to come in?" An answer is given to a situation. When the </div>
<div id="ta_15" class="t s1_15">situation changes, the answer changes. It is a response. </div>
<div id="tb_15" class="t s1_15">Buddha said, "The first man who asked was an atheist. In fact he was not an </div>
<div id="tc_15" class="t s1_15">inquirer. When I looked in him he had a position -- he has already achieved, </div>
<div id="td_15" class="t s1_15">arrived. He has concluded: he has concluded that there is no God. He had come </div>
<div id="te_15" class="t s1_15">only for a confirmation from me so that he can go and say to people, 'Buddha </div>
<div id="tf_15" class="t s1_15">also believes the same way I believe: that there is no God.' I had to say no to him. </div>
<div id="tg_15" class="t s1_15">"The man who came in the afternoon was also with a conclusion. He was a theist, </div>
<div id="th_15" class="t s1_15">a staunch, orthodox theist -- he believed that God exists. He had also come with </div>
<div id="ti_15" class="t s1_15">the same mind, to be confirmed. </div>
<div id="tj_15" class="t s1_15">"The third man who had come was without any position, with no mind. He was </div>
<div id="tk_15" class="t s1_15">an inquirer. He didn't believe in anything: he has not arrived. He was on the </div>
<div id="tl_15" class="t s1_15">way; he was pure. I had to remain silent with him. Now, if you have the same </div>
<div id="tm_15" class="t s1_15">question, you can ask." </div>
<div id="tn_15" class="t s1_15">A response will always be different, and yet deep down will be a running current </div>
<div id="to_15" class="t s1_15">of being. Always Buddha looks into the man, into the situation. The situation </div>
<div id="tp_15" class="t s1_15">decides -- not Buddha's mind; he has none. </div>
<div id="tq_15" class="t s1_15">So you ask, "Wow does a Buddha participate totally in day-to-day life?" If you </div>
<div id="tr_15" class="t s1_15">try to participate totally it will not be total: no effort can ever be total. No </div>
<div id="ts_15" class="t s1_15">technique can ever be total, because you will be manipulating. You will be </div>
<div id="tt_15" class="t s1_15">separate from it; you will be trying to be total. How can you try to be total? You </div>
<div id="tu_15" class="t s1_15">can relax; only then totality comes into being. You are in a let-go; then you are </div>
<div id="tv_15" class="t s1_15">total. </div>
<div id="tw_15" class="t s1_15">Totality is not a discipline. All disciplines are partial. That's why a man who is </div>
<div id="tx_15" class="t s1_15">much too disciplined will never reach to the truth, because he will always be </div>
<div id="ty_15" class="t s1_15">carrying the burden -- doing something continuously: gross or subtle, on the </div>
<div id="tz_15" class="t s1_15">surface or in the depth, but always a doer. No, Buddha is not a doer. In fact when </div>
<div id="t10_15" class="t s1_15">you relax there is no other way to be -- the only way left is to participate totally. </div>
<div id="t11_15" class="t s1_15">It has no "how" to it, but the question arises in your mind because you don't </div>
<div id="t12_15" class="t s1_15">know what awareness is. It is just as a blind man asks, "How do people who </div>
<div id="t13_15" class="t s1_15">have eyes move without a stick in their hands to grope their way?" If you say to </div>
<div id="t14_15" class="t s1_15">him that they don't need any stick, that they don't need groping, he will not be </div>
<div id="t15_15" class="t s1_15">able to believe. He will laugh. He will say, "You are joking. How is it possible? </div>
<div id="t16_15" class="t s1_15">Do you mean to say that men with eyes simply move without groping?" A blind </div>
<div id="t17_15" class="t s1_15">man cannot understand it. He has no experience of it. He has always been </div>
