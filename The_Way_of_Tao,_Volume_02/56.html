<div id="t1_56" class="t s1_56">CHAPTER 4. TAO’S UNPRESENT PRESENCE</div>
<div id="t2_56" class="t s2_56">He cannot be seen, so when some one comes along who claims he has seen Him, he is singled</div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s2_56">out from the crowd, and stands like a lone ﬁgure against the crowd who revile him. Buddha, Christ,</div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s2_56">Mahavira, Mohammed, stood alone against the whole world.</div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s2_56">In fact, there have not been more</div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s2_56">solitary ﬁgures than them in the history of this world. They lived surrounded by crowds and yet they</div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s2_56">were alone.</div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s2_56">Mahavira was always surrounded by a crowd, but he was alone within himself because not a single</div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s2_56">person understood or believed what he said. Lao Tzu also found himself surrounded by thousands</div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s2_56">of people, yet he was alone. Those who heard him doubted his words because they could not see</div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s2_56">what he saw. Yet these were lovable persons. Their personality was magnetic.</div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s2_56">We doubt the words of these people and yet we cannot help but follow them. Their elan vital is ﬁlled</div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s2_56">with a mysterious magnet that draws us towards them. Their eyes are hypnotic. Once they catch</div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s2_56">you, they do not leave you. We do not have the courage to accept what they say, and time and again</div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s2_56">we wish to run away from them. We try to criticize them, we try to escape from them, and yet there</div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s2_56">is something in them that invariably draws us towards them. But these are solitary people because</div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s2_56">they talk of Him whom they ﬁnd present but who is absolutely non-present for us.</div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s2_56">Ramakrishna told Vivekananda. ”I have come to know that you have not eaten for days. Why don’t</div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s2_56">you go inside the temple and tell Mother about it, you foolish fellow? Go and ask Her for what you</div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s2_56">want.”</div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s2_56">Vivekananda was an intellectual who took nothing for granted and when Ramakrishna talked like</div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s2_56">this he wondered, ”Where’s the mother? Who is this mother?” But Ramakrishna spoke with such</div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s2_56">faith and conviction that he did not dare to raise these questions that arose in his mind.</div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s2_56">His father had died, leaving a debt to be cleared. He found it impossible to clear it. There was not</div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s2_56">enough food for two in the house, so everyday he pretended he was invited out so that his mother</div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s2_56">would eat. He would return home in the evening and talk about how much he had enjoyed the meal</div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s2_56">so that his mother would be assured that he had eaten.</div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s2_56">Under such conditions, Ramakrishna’s</div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s2_56">words seemed to be the words of a madman. Which mother was he talking about? He could not</div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s2_56">believe.</div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s2_56">Ramakrishna had just become the priest of the temple when the trustees ﬁled a suit against him. On</div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s2_56">the eighth day, he was called before the committee and charged with tasting the food before it was</div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s2_56">offered in worship. To this, Ramakrishna replied, ”When my mother used to feed me, she always</div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s2_56">tasted the food ﬁrst. How can I offer my Divine Mother what has not been tasted and tested? How</div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s2_56">can I be sure it is ﬁt to be put before Her?”</div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s2_56">The trustees were ﬁlled with despair. What mother was he talking about? The temple was theirs,</div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s2_56">the idol was one they had erected. Surely this man was mad! He was a worker employed by them</div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s2_56">for eighteen rupees a month, they had spent lakhs on constructing this temple, and this man had</div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s2_56">the temerity to say he would rather leave the job than offer untasted food to his mother! He insisted</div>
<div id="t14_56" class="t s2_56">on smelling the ﬂowers ﬁrst before offering them to Her, because how could ﬂowers be offered to</div>
<div id="t15_56" class="t s2_56">the mother that bore no fragrance? The members of the Board looked at each other. What was this</div>
<div id="t16_56" class="t s2_56">man saying? It was unbelievable. And yet when they looked into his eyes, they felt that they would</div>
<div id="t17_56" class="t s2_56">have to believe what he said. Perhaps he could see what they could not!</div>
<div id="t18_56" class="t s2_56">The Way of Tao, Volume 2</div>
<div id="t19_56" class="t s2_56">56</div>
<div id="t1a_56" class="t s3_56">Osho</div>
