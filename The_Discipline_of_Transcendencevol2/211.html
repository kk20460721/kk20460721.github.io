<div id="t1_211" class="t s1_211">Even scientists were very much puzzled, because there were moments in </div>
<div id="t2_211" class="t s1_211">Nijinsky's dance when he would leap and jump -- and those leaps were </div>
<div id="t3_211" class="t s1_211">tremendous, almost impossible leaps. A man cannot leap that way; the </div>
<div id="t4_211" class="t s1_211">gravitation does not allow. And the most beautiful and amazing part was that </div>
<div id="t5_211" class="t s1_211">when Nijinsky would be coming back from the leap he would come so slowly </div>
<div id="t6_211" class="t s1_211">that it is impossible. He would come so slowly as if a leaf is falling from a tree... </div>
<div id="t7_211" class="t s1_211">very slowly, very slowly, very slowly. </div>
<div id="t8_211" class="t s1_211">It is not possible, it is against the physical law, it is against physics. The </div>
<div id="t9_211" class="t s1_211">gravitation does not make any exceptions, not even for a Nijinsky. And he was </div>
<div id="ta_211" class="t s1_211">asked again and again, 'What happens? How do you fall so slowly? Because it is </div>
<div id="tb_211" class="t s1_211">not within your power to control -- the gravitation pulls you.' He said, 'It does </div>
<div id="tc_211" class="t s1_211">not happen always, only rarely -- when the dancer disappears. Then sometimes I </div>
<div id="td_211" class="t s1_211">am also puzzled, surprised, not only you. I see myself coming so slowly, so </div>
<div id="te_211" class="t s1_211">gracefully, and I know that the gravitation does not exist in that moment.' </div>
<div id="tf_211" class="t s1_211">He must be functioning in another dimension where the physical law does not </div>
<div id="tg_211" class="t s1_211">exist, where another law starts working that spiritualists call the law of </div>
<div id="th_211" class="t s1_211">levitation. </div>
<div id="ti_211" class="t s1_211">And it seems absolutely rational and logical to have both the laws, because each </div>
<div id="tj_211" class="t s1_211">law has to be counterbalanced by another law in the opposite direction. If there is </div>
<div id="tk_211" class="t s1_211">light there is darkness, if there is life there is death, if there is gravitation there </div>
<div id="tl_211" class="t s1_211">must be levitation that pulls you up. There must be ways where a person is </div>
<div id="tm_211" class="t s1_211">pulled up. </div>
<div id="tn_211" class="t s1_211">There are stories... especially the story about Mohammed -- that he went to </div>
<div id="to_211" class="t s1_211">heaven with his physical body; not only with his physical body, with his horse. </div>
<div id="tp_211" class="t s1_211">Sitting on the horse, he simply went to heaven, upwards. It looks absurd, </div>
<div id="tq_211" class="t s1_211">Mohammedans have not been able to prove it, but the meaning is clear. The story </div>
<div id="tr_211" class="t s1_211">may have not exactly happened, but the meaning is clear. </div>
<div id="ts_211" class="t s1_211">The meaning is to be understood, it is very symbolical. It simply says that there is </div>
<div id="tt_211" class="t s1_211">a law of levitation and if Mohammed cannot be pulled by levitation, then who </div>
<div id="tu_211" class="t s1_211">will be pulled? He is the right person, a person who exists not. The ego is under </div>
<div id="tv_211" class="t s1_211">gravitation, the no-ego is not under gravitation -- a weightlessness arises. </div>
<div id="tw_211" class="t s1_211">Nijinsky went mad because he was simply a dancer and he never knew anything </div>
<div id="tx_211" class="t s1_211">about meditation, ecstasy, enlightenment. That became a trouble for him. </div>
<div id="ty_211" class="t s1_211">If you don't understand and if you don't move with awareness and suddenly you </div>
<div id="tz_211" class="t s1_211">stumble upon something which cannot be explained by ordinary laws, you will </div>
<div id="t10_211" class="t s1_211">go mad. Because you will be disturbed by it. It is so weird, it is so eerie. You </div>
<div id="t11_211" class="t s1_211">cannot explain it. You start getting disturbed by it. He himself started getting </div>
<div id="t12_211" class="t s1_211">disturbed by the phenomenon. Finally it was so staggering it disturbed his whole </div>
<div id="t13_211" class="t s1_211">mind. </div>
<div id="t14_211" class="t s1_211">God is very destructive. If you don't go rightly, you will be destroyed, because </div>
<div id="t15_211" class="t s1_211">god is fire. Many people go mad if they don't move rightly. If they don't move </div>
<div id="t16_211" class="t s1_211">under right guidance they can go mad. It is not a child's play, one has to </div>
