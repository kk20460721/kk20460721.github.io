<div id="t1_6" class="t s1_6">There were three travelers -- a Jew, a Hindu and an Italian -- who needed a place to stay </div>
<div id="t2_6" class="t s1_6">overnight. They knocked on a farmer's door. The farmer said he only had room for two </div>
<div id="t3_6" class="t s1_6">in the house, but one could sleep in the barn. The Jew said he would sleep in the barn. </div>
<div id="t4_6" class="t s1_6">They all settled down for the night. A little while later there was a knock on the door. </div>
<div id="t5_6" class="t s1_6">The farmer answered it; it was the Jew. He apologized, but said there was a pig in the </div>
<div id="t6_6" class="t s1_6">barn and as pigs were not kosher he could not spend the night in the same place as </div>
<div id="t7_6" class="t s1_6">them. The Hindu said he would sleep in the barn as pigs did not bother him. </div>
<div id="t8_6" class="t s1_6">Again the farmer went back to bed. A little while later there was a knock at the door; it </div>
<div id="t9_6" class="t s1_6">was the Hindu. He apologized and said he was sorry, but there was a cow in the barn </div>
<div id="ta_6" class="t s1_6">and as cows were sacred animals it was not proper for him to sleep in the same place as </div>
<div id="tb_6" class="t s1_6">them. So the Italian offered to sleep in the barn as he had no problem with cows or pigs. </div>
<div id="tc_6" class="t s1_6">Again the farmer went to bed, but a little while later there was a knock at the door. The </div>
<div id="td_6" class="t s1_6">tired farmer got up and answered it. There stood the cow and the pig! </div>
<div id="te_6" class="t s1_6">Even cows can see, even pigs can feel that you are an Italian -- but not you! You never </div>
<div id="tf_6" class="t s1_6">look at yourself, you always look at others. You are focused on others. You are so </div>
<div id="tg_6" class="t s1_6">extrovert that you don't know how to turn your eyes in. And a hundred-and-eighty-</div>
<div id="th_6" class="t s1_6">degree turn is needed. Unless you start seeing yourself there is no possibility of mastery </div>
<div id="ti_6" class="t s1_6">in your life; you will remain a slave. </div>
<div id="tj_6" class="t s1_6">When you fall in love you think you are a master. Are you, or is it just a biological, </div>
<div id="tk_6" class="t s1_6">chemical phenomenon? If it is a biological and chemical phenomenon you are not the </div>
<div id="tl_6" class="t s1_6">master. When somebody insults you and you become angry, are YOU angry or are you </div>
<div id="tm_6" class="t s1_6">just a victim of some unconscious force that is being released in you? When you are </div>
<div id="tn_6" class="t s1_6">angry, enraged, you are almost temporarily insane; you can do anything. You can </div>
<div id="to_6" class="t s1_6">destroy, you can kill, you can commit suicide. And whatsoever you do, if you survive </div>
<div id="tp_6" class="t s1_6">the moment you will repent. You will say, "I cannot believe how it happened, how I </div>
<div id="tq_6" class="t s1_6">could do such a thing? I did it in spite of myself!" </div>
<div id="tr_6" class="t s1_6">That expression is significant. Whenever you say, "I did it in spite of myself," you are </div>
<div id="ts_6" class="t s1_6">recognizing, without knowing it, your slavery: that things happen in you which are </div>
<div id="tt_6" class="t s1_6">happening without you -- you are just a victim. </div>
<div id="tu_6" class="t s1_6">Nobody is born as a master, but everybody is born with a tremendous potential to be a </div>
<div id="tv_6" class="t s1_6">master. Everybody can be a master, but very rarely do people attain to their potential. </div>
<div id="tw_6" class="t s1_6">Very rarely do people attain to their maximum peak, to the crescendo of their being. </div>
<div id="tx_6" class="t s1_6">The psychologists say that the ordinary person only uses seven to ten percent of his </div>
<div id="ty_6" class="t s1_6">potential in his whole life; ninety percent or more remains unused. And this is about the </div>
<div id="tz_6" class="t s1_6">ordinary person. The psychologists say even the talented people, very talented people, </div>
<div id="t10_6" class="t s1_6">don't use more than twelve to thirteen percent. And the people we call geniuses, they </div>
<div id="t11_6" class="t s1_6">don't use more than fifteen percent of their potential. </div>
<div id="t12_6" class="t s1_6">Just think, if the whole of humanity were using one hundred percent of its potential -- </div>
<div id="t13_6" class="t s1_6">which it is capable of -- there would be no need to IMAGINE a paradise, we could make </div>
<div id="t14_6" class="t s1_6">it here. We will be in paradise if one hundred percent potential is being used by </div>
<div id="t15_6" class="t s1_6">everyone. But if you don't use it, it remains like a weight. Rather than being a help in </div>
