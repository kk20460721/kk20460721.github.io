<div id="t1_135" class="t s1_135">utterly meaningless, that he had started lately to contemplate suicide. Seeing Buddha </div>
<div id="t2_135" class="t s1_135">and his divine beauty, his grace -- and Shrona was a very aesthetic person -- seeing </div>
<div id="t3_135" class="t s1_135">Buddha he immediately fell in love with him. </div>
<div id="t4_135" class="t s1_135">He didn't go back to his palace. He asked Buddha with folded hands, "Give me sannyas. </div>
<div id="t5_135" class="t s1_135">Initiate me." </div>
<div id="t6_135" class="t s1_135">Buddha hesitated a little bit because he knew everything about Shrona and his life; it </div>
<div id="t7_135" class="t s1_135">would be difficult for him. He may not have tasted water for years; alcohol was the only </div>
<div id="t8_135" class="t s1_135">thing that he used to drink. He had indulged so much that for a moment Buddha was </div>
<div id="t9_135" class="t s1_135">hesitant. </div>
<div id="ta_135" class="t s1_135">But Shrona said, "Don't hesitate. I am fed up with my life, I am finished with it! If you </div>
<div id="tb_135" class="t s1_135">don't give me sannyas I will commit suicide -- and that will be your responsibility!" </div>
<div id="tc_135" class="t s1_135">My own observation is also this: that a man really becomes a sannyasin when he comes </div>
<div id="td_135" class="t s1_135">to the point where there are only two possibilities: either suicide or sannyas. </div>
<div id="te_135" class="t s1_135">Buddha had to initiate him immediately, because he did not want to be responsible for </div>
<div id="tf_135" class="t s1_135">his suicide. But what Buddha had not expected started happening. Shrona became just </div>
<div id="tg_135" class="t s1_135">the opposite of what he had been up to now. Up to now he had been absolutely </div>
<div id="th_135" class="t s1_135">indulgent in everything, in every possible thing. Now he became a great ascetic, so </div>
<div id="ti_135" class="t s1_135">much so that he started torturing his body, he became a masochist. He would lie down </div>
<div id="tj_135" class="t s1_135">on thorns, he would stand in the hot sun. He would not live as other sannyasins were </div>
<div id="tk_135" class="t s1_135">living -- moderately, balanced, the life of the golden mean. No, he moved to the other </div>
<div id="tl_135" class="t s1_135">extreme. Within six months it was impossible to recognize him, he had become so thin, </div>
<div id="tm_135" class="t s1_135">so dark. He was a beautiful person; he had become ugly. He was starving himself. </div>
<div id="tn_135" class="t s1_135">Buddhist sannyasins used to eat once a day and he used to eat only thrice a week, and </div>
<div id="to_135" class="t s1_135">that too, so little! </div>
<div id="tp_135" class="t s1_135">It happens: people can move to the extreme very easily. Mind lives in extremes -- from </div>
<div id="tq_135" class="t s1_135">one extreme one can jump to the other extreme very easily. The most difficult thing is to </div>
<div id="tr_135" class="t s1_135">remain in the middle, because to remain in the middle you will need awareness. </div>
<div id="ts_135" class="t s1_135">Moving from one extreme to the other you don't need awareness. You were </div>
<div id="tt_135" class="t s1_135">unconscious before as an indulgent person, now you are unconscious as a great ascetic. </div>
<div id="tu_135" class="t s1_135">First you were stuffing yourself with food and you were unconscious, now you are </div>
<div id="tv_135" class="t s1_135">starving yourself and you are unconscious. </div>
<div id="tw_135" class="t s1_135">The man of consciousness stays in the middle: neither too much nor too little. He </div>
<div id="tx_135" class="t s1_135">always gives to the body what is needed, to the mind what is needed. His life has a very </div>
<div id="ty_135" class="t s1_135">very rhythmic quality to it. He responds to his requirements very consciously, </div>
<div id="tz_135" class="t s1_135">responsibly, but he does not go in an insane manner this way or that. </div>
<div id="t10_135" class="t s1_135">After six months Buddha had to go to him. Shrona had wounds all over the body </div>
<div id="t11_135" class="t s1_135">because he was lying down on thorns. He was stinking because he had stopped taking </div>
<div id="t12_135" class="t s1_135">baths; he thought that too was luxury</div>
<div id="t13_135" class="t s1_135">....</div>
<div id="t14_135" class="t s1_135">In India, Jaina monks don't take any baths, they don't clean their teeth, because that is </div>
<div id="t15_135" class="t s1_135">thought to be too materialistic -- you are decorating the body. It is very difficult to talk </div>
<div id="t16_135" class="t s1_135">to Jaina monks. They used to come to me before, but fortunately they no longer come </div>
<div id="t17_135" class="t s1_135">here. It was so difficult to talk to them because their breath smell is simply unbelievable, </div>
<div id="t18_135" class="t s1_135">their body odor is intolerable! But that is thought to be a great renunciation. </div>
