<div id="t3_130" class="t s1_130">It is a method. It is an understanding. If you believe in some. thing it affects you </div>
<div id="t4_130" class="t s1_130">as real; your belief makes it real. If you believe that it is not real, it cannot affect </div>
<div id="t5_130" class="t s1_130">you. It may even be real, but then too, it cannot affect you. </div>
<div id="t6_130" class="t s1_130">For example, you are sitting in a dark room and suddenly you see something in </div>
<div id="t7_130" class="t s1_130">the room. You feel it is a snake... fear, panic. You put the light on but there is </div>

<div id="ti_130" class="t s1_130">he thought that these people standing in front were enemies, that they were real. </div>
