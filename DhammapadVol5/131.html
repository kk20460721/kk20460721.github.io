<div id="t1_131" class="t s1_131">contest was going to happen and the bow was brought, a false messenger came running </div>
<div id="t2_131" class="t s1_131">to Ravana and said, "What are you doing here? Your country is on fire. Sri Lanka is </div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s1_131">burning!" </div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s1_131">So he rushed immediately to Sri Lanka. Meanwhile Rama won the contest and was </div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s1_131">married to Sita. This is the story. </div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s1_131">Now, in a village it happened: the play was being played, and when the messenger </div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s1_131">comes and says to Ravana, "Your country is on fire!" he said, "Let it be. I don't care. This </div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s1_131">time I'm going to win Sita. Enough is enough!" </div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s1_131">In fact, this man had always loved the woman who was acting as Sita, deep down in his </div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s1_131">heart. He completely forgot the play; he became utterly identified. It became a reality. </div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s1_131">He rose... now it was not Shiva's real bow, just one a village carpenter had made. He </div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s1_131">broke it into many pieces and threw it away before anybody could prevent him. Then </div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s1_131">he said to Janaka, "Now, where is Sita?" </div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s1_131">Now, what to do with such a man? And the whole audience was simply shocked. He </div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s1_131">was finishing the whole story, because now there could be no more to it. The whole </div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s1_131">story depends on Ravana being avoided, Rama getting married, and then the struggle </div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s1_131">when Ravana steals Sita, and the war and the whole thing happens. But if Ravana </div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s1_131">marries Sita, then it is all finished within two minutes -- and it is just the beginning, the </div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s1_131">first scene. And the man who had become Ravana was the strongest man in the village, </div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s1_131">naturally, and Rama was just a boy. He could crush Rama at any moment! </div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s1_131">For a moment there was utter silence. But Janaka, the father of Sita, was an old man, an </div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s1_131">experienced man; he had played the role many times. He said, "It seems that my </div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s1_131">servants have brought the wrong bow. This is not the real bow, drop the curtain and </div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s1_131">bring the real bow!" The curtain was dropped... ten people had to carry Ravana out, but </div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s1_131">he was shouting and people could hear him saying, "Where is Sita? This time I am not </div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s1_131">going to lose!" </div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s1_131">Somehow tranquilizers were given to him, he was put to sleep -- otherwise he might </div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s1_131">have come back again and created trouble -- and another man had to play the role. He </div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s1_131">became too much identified. He forgot that this was just a play. </div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s1_131">The real actor has to live a paradox: he has to act as if he is what he is acting, and yet </div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s1_131">deep down he knows that "I am not this." That's why I say acting is the most spiritual of </div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s1_131">professions. </div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s1_131">The really spiritual person transforms his whole life into acting. Then this whole earth is </div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s1_131">just a stage, and all the people are nothing but actors, and we are enacting a play. Then </div>

<div id="t10_131" class="t s1_131">you play your act as beautifully as you can. But deep down the beggar knows, "I am not </div>

<div id="t12_131" class="t s1_131">If the beggar and the king both know that "What I am doing and acting is just acting; it </div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s1_131">is not me, not my reality," then both are arriving at the very center of their being, what I </div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s1_131">call witnessing. Then they are performing certain acts and witnessing too. </div>
