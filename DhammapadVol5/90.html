<div id="t1_90" class="t s1_90">we are carrying. They don't work anymore, they don't help anybody -- they hinder </div>
<div id="t2_90" class="t s1_90">everybody. </div>
<div id="t3_90" class="t s1_90">So don't ask me, Prem Murti, what is right and what is wrong -- it depends. All I can </div>
<div id="t4_90" class="t s1_90">say to you, all I would like you to be aware of is: any act done in awareness is right and </div>
<div id="t5_90" class="t s1_90">any act done in unawareness is wrong. The act does not matter as far as I am concerned, </div>
<div id="t6_90" class="t s1_90">my approach is concerned, my philosophy of life is concerned; the act does not matter, </div>
<div id="t7_90" class="t s1_90">what matters is your consciousness. Are you acting unconsciously or consciously? </div>
<div id="t8_90" class="t s1_90">So the real question is something within you, not what you do but who you are. I </div>
<div id="t9_90" class="t s1_90">change the whole emphasis from the objective to the subjective, from the outer to the </div>
<div id="ta_90" class="t s1_90">inner. If you are doing it consciously you are right -- and that has always been the </div>
<div id="tb_90" class="t s1_90">approach of the enlightened ones. </div>
<div id="tc_90" class="t s1_90">A great master, Nagarjuna, was asked by a great thief</div>
<div id="td_90" class="t s1_90">....</div>
<div id="te_90" class="t s1_90">The thief was well known over </div>
<div id="tf_90" class="t s1_90">the whole kingdom and he was so clever, so intelligent that he had never been caught. </div>
<div id="tg_90" class="t s1_90">Everybody knew -- he had even stolen from the king's treasury, many times -- but they </div>
<div id="th_90" class="t s1_90">were unable to catch him. He was very elusive, a master artist. </div>
<div id="ti_90" class="t s1_90">He asked Nagarjuna, "Can you help me? Can I get rid of my stealing? Can I also become </div>
<div id="tj_90" class="t s1_90">as silent and blissful as you are?" It happened in a certain context. </div>
<div id="tk_90" class="t s1_90">Nagarjuna was the greatest alchemist that the East has given birth to. He used to live </div>
<div id="tl_90" class="t s1_90">naked, with just a begging bowl, a wooden begging bowl, but kings worshipped him, </div>
<div id="tm_90" class="t s1_90">queens worshipped him. He came to the capital and the queen touched his feet and </div>
<div id="tn_90" class="t s1_90">said, "I feel very much offended by your wooden bowl. You are a master of masters; </div>
<div id="to_90" class="t s1_90">hundreds of kings and queens are your followers. I have prepared a golden bowl for </div>
<div id="tp_90" class="t s1_90">you, studded with beautiful diamonds, emeralds. Please don't reject it -- it will wound </div>
<div id="tq_90" class="t s1_90">me very much, it will hurt me very much. For three years great artists have been </div>
<div id="tr_90" class="t s1_90">working on it, now it is ready." </div>
<div id="ts_90" class="t s1_90">She was afraid that Nagarjuna might say, "I cannot touch gold, I have renounced the </div>
<div id="tt_90" class="t s1_90">world." But Nagarjuna did not say anything like that; he said, "Okay! You can keep my </div>
<div id="tu_90" class="t s1_90">begging bowl, give me the golden one." </div>
<div id="tv_90" class="t s1_90">Even the queen was a little shocked. She was thinking that Nagarjuna would say, "I </div>
<div id="tw_90" class="t s1_90">cannot accept it." She wanted him to accept it, but still, deep in her unconscious </div>
<div id="tx_90" class="t s1_90">somewhere was the old Indian tradition that the awakened one has to live in poverty, in </div>
<div id="ty_90" class="t s1_90">discomfort, as if discomfort and poverty have something spiritual in them. There is </div>
<div id="tz_90" class="t s1_90">nothing spiritual in them. </div>
<div id="t10_90" class="t s1_90">Nagarjuna said okay. He didn't even look at the golden bowl. He went away. The thief </div>
<div id="t11_90" class="t s1_90">saw Nagarjuna moving outside the capital, because he was staying in a ruined temple </div>
<div id="t12_90" class="t s1_90">on the other bank of the river. The thief said, "Such a precious thing I have never seen -- </div>
<div id="t13_90" class="t s1_90">so many diamonds, so many emeralds, so much gold. I have seen many beautiful things </div>
<div id="t14_90" class="t s1_90">in my life but never such a thing, and how did this naked man get hold of it, and how is </div>
<div id="t15_90" class="t s1_90">he going to protect it? Anybody will be able to take it away from him, so why not me?" </div>
<div id="t16_90" class="t s1_90">The thief followed Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna heard his footsteps, he knew somebody was </div>
<div id="t17_90" class="t s1_90">coming behind him. Nagarjuna reached the temple. The temple was an absolute ruin, </div>
