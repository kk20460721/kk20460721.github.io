<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">with his perspiration. </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">Buddha says to do virtue is like perspiration. Your unconscious habits evaporate </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">through it. So not doing bad is actually doing good. Don't be negatively </div>

<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">I have heard about a saint who used to beat himself every morning, and he </div>

<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">he was thought to be a very holy man, and nobody knew that he had ever </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">committed any sin because he was such a virtuous man. And for forty years </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">people had watched him -- he was always in the public eye, he was always </div>

<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">him, and nobody had seen that he had ever done anything wrong; he was </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">continuously praying. But every morning he would beat himself, blood would </div>

<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">this, otherwise I won't allow you in heaven. You have not done anything </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">wrong."' Just when he was young he saw a beautiful woman pass and desire </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">arose in him, just an urge to have this woman. That was the only sin that he had </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">committed -- just a thought -- and for forty years he was beating himself. Even </div>
