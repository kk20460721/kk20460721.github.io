<div id="t1_32" class="t s1_32">How can this man pray? One who is so afraid of ghosts, how can he love God? </div>
<div id="t2_32" class="t s1_32">Because one who loves God, his fear disappears. But he deceived many people. </div>
<div id="t3_32" class="t s1_32">Or, even if he didn't deceive many people, he deceived himself at least. </div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s1_32">Remember, always start from the beginning. Look where you are clinging and </div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s1_32">why you are clinging. Don't ask for the "how" to surrender. Just watch and find </div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s1_32">out why you are clinging to the ego, why you are stubborn. </div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s1_32">If you still feel that the ego is going to deliver some heaven for you, then wait -- </div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s1_32">no need to surrender. If you feel that all promises are false and the ego is a </div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s1_32">deceiver, then what is the need to ask how to surrender? Don't cling. In fact, once </div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s1_32">you know that this is fire, you drop it. It is not a question of not clinging. You </div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s1_32">simply drop it. When you come to know that your house is on fire, you don't ask </div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s1_32">anybody how to get out. </div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s1_32">Once it happened, I was staying in a house, and just in front of the house a house </div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s1_32">caught fire. It was a three-storied house, and one fat man who used to live on the </div>
<div id="tf_32" class="t s1_32">third story was trying to jump from the window. The whole crowd was saying, </div>
<div id="tg_32" class="t s1_32">"Don't jump! We are bringing a ladder!" But who listens when the house is on </div>
<div id="th_32" class="t s1_32">fire? He jumped. He could not even wait for the ladder. And there was no </div>
<div id="ti_32" class="t s1_32">danger yet because the fire was just on the first story. To reach to the third it </div>
<div id="tj_32" class="t s1_32">would have taken time, and the ladder was being brought, and the whole crowd </div>
<div id="tk_32" class="t s1_32">was shouting at him, "Wait!!" But he couldn't listen. He jumped and broke his </div>
<div id="tl_32" class="t s1_32">leg. </div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s1_32">Later on I went to see him and I asked, "You did a miracle. You didn't ask how to </div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s1_32">jump. Have you ever jumped from three-story buildings before?" </div>
<div id="to_32" class="t s1_32">He said, "Never." </div>
<div id="tp_32" class="t s1_32">"Have you ever practiced?" </div>
<div id="tq_32" class="t s1_32">He said, "Never." </div>
<div id="tr_32" class="t s1_32">"Any rehearsal?" </div>
<div id="ts_32" class="t s1_32">He said, "What are you talking about! This is for the first time!" </div>
<div id="tt_32" class="t s1_32">"Did you consult any book? You asked for a teacher? You inquired of </div>
<div id="tu_32" class="t s1_32">somebody?" </div>
<div id="tv_32" class="t s1_32">He said, "What are you talking about? I could not even wait for my wife to come, </div>
<div id="tw_32" class="t s1_32">my children to come, and I couldn't even understand why the people were </div>
<div id="tx_32" class="t s1_32">shouting so much. Only later on, when I was lying on the ground, then I could </div>
<div id="ty_32" class="t s1_32">understand that they were bringing a ladder." </div>
<div id="tz_32" class="t s1_32">When the house is on fire you jump out of it. You don't ask the "how." And I tell </div>
<div id="t10_32" class="t s1_32">you Your house is on fire. Immediately, you ask how to jump out of it. No, you </div>
<div id="t11_32" class="t s1_32">have not understood the point. Still you don't feel that your house is on fire I say, </div>
<div id="t12_32" class="t s1_32">so my saying creates in you an idea "how to jump out of it?" If really you </div>
<div id="t13_32" class="t s1_32">understand that your house is on fire, even if I should. "I am bringing a ladder! </div>
<div id="t14_32" class="t s1_32">Wait!" you are not going to wait. You will jump. You may break your legs. </div>
<div id="t15_32" class="t s1_32">But at ease, comfortably, conveniently, you ask, "How to surrender?" There is no </div>
<div id="t16_32" class="t s1_32">"how." Just look at the misery that the ego creates. If you can feel it you will come </div>
<div id="t17_32" class="t s1_32">out of it. </div>
