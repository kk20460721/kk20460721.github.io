<div id="t1_52" class="t s1_52">The king was much astonished by this answer, which he didn't understand, and </div>
<div id="t2_52" class="t s1_52">when he saw smiles on the faces of those around him, he was angry and threw </div>
<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">the grain upon the ground thinking that he was being mocked. And to </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">Zarathustra he said, "I was foolish to waste my time by coming here to see you." </div>
<div id="t5_52" class="t s1_52">Years passed. The king was successful as a ruler and a warrior, and led a life of </div>
<div id="t6_52" class="t s1_52">luxury and apparent contentment, but at night when he went to bed, strange </div>
<div id="t7_52" class="t s1_52">thoughts came into his mind and troubled him: "I live in luxury and abundance </div>
<div id="t8_52" class="t s1_52">in this splendid palace, but how long shall I enjoy this -- this abundance, this </div>
<div id="t9_52" class="t s1_52">power, this wealth -- and what will happen to me when I die? Can my power </div>
<div id="ta_52" class="t s1_52">and my riches save me from illness and death? Is everything lost with the </div>
<div id="tb_52" class="t s1_52">coming of death?" </div>
<div id="tc_52" class="t s1_52">No one in the palace could answer these questions, but meanwhile, the fame of </div>
<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">Zarathustra grew. So putting aside his pride, he dispatched a great caravan of </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">treasure to Zarathustra and with it an invitation and a request. "I regret." he </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">wrote, "that when I was impatient and thoughtless in my youth, I asked you to </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">explain the great problems of existence in a few minutes of time. I have changed </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">and do not want the impossible now, but I am still deeply interested to know the </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">laws of the universe and the forces of nature, even more so than when I was a </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">young man. Come to my palace. I pray you. Or if that is not possible, then send </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">to me the best of your disciples that he may teach me all that he can about these </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">questions." </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">After an interval, the caravan and the messengers returned. These told the king </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">that they had found Zarathustra, who sent him greeting, but returned the </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">proffered treasure. The treasure, Zarathustra had said, was of no use to him </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">because he has attained to the ultimate treasure. Moreover, Zarathustra had sent </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">the king a gift wrapped in a leaf and had asked the messengers to tell him that </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">this was the teacher who could teach him everything. </div>
<div id="ts_52" class="t s1_52">The king opened it and found the same grain again -- the same grain of wheat </div>
<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">that Zarathustra had given him before. He thought there must be something </div>
<div id="tu_52" class="t s1_52">mysterious and magical in it, so he put it in a golden box and hid it among his </div>
<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">treasures. Almost every day he looked at it expecting some miracle to happen, </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">such as the turning of the grain of wheat into something or someone that would </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">teach him all he wished to know. </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">Months went by, and then years, but nothing happened. At last the king lost </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">patience and said. "It seems that Zarathustra has deceived me again. Either he is </div>
<div id="t10_52" class="t s1_52">making a mock of me or else he does not know the answers to my questions, but </div>
<div id="t11_52" class="t s1_52">I will show him that I can find the answers without his help." So the king sent a </div>
<div id="t12_52" class="t s1_52">caravan to a great Indian mystic, Tshengregacha, to whom came disciples from </div>
<div id="t13_52" class="t s1_52">all over the world, and with the caravan went the same messengers and the same </div>
<div id="t14_52" class="t s1_52">treasure that he had once sent to Zarathustra. </div>
<div id="t15_52" class="t s1_52">After many months, the messengers returned from India with the philosopher, </div>
