<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">CHAPTER 3. THE OCCULT SCIENCE OF THE THIRD EYE</div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s2_44">It proved that Ramanujan was not replying through the medium of the mind. He was not very learned,</div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s2_44">he had actually failed in matriculation; there was no other sign of intellectual ability, but in connection</div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s2_44">with mathematics he was superhuman. Something happened that was beyond the human mind. He</div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s2_44">died when he was thirty-six because of tuberculosis.</div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s2_44">When he was in hospital, Hardy, along with two or three other mathematician friends, went to see</div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s2_44">him. As it happened, he parked his car in such a place so that Ramanujan could see its number</div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s2_44">plate. When Hardy went into Ramanujan’s room, he told Hardy that his number plate was unique:</div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s2_44">it had four special aspects to it. After that, Ramanujan died. Hardy took six months to understand</div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s2_44">what Ramanujan meant, but he could only discover three of the four aspects. On his death he left</div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s2_44">a will that research work on that number should continue, to ﬁnd out the fourth aspect. Because</div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s2_44">Ramanujan had said there was a fourth, there had to be. Twenty-two years after Hardy’s death, the</div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s2_44">fourth was discovered. Ramanujan was right.</div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s2_44">Whenever he began to look into any mathematical problem something began to happen in the middle</div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s2_44">space between his two eyebrows. Both his eyeballs turned upwards, centering on that middle space.</div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s2_44">In Yoga, that space is described as the third eye spot. It is called the third eye because if that eye</div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s2_44">becomes activated it is possible to see events and scenes of some different world in their entirety.</div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s2_44">It is like looking out of your house through a small hole in the door, and suddenly, when the door</div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s2_44">opens, you see the whole sky. There is a space between the two eyebrows where there is a small</div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s2_44">aperture which sometimes opens – as in the case of Ramanujan. His eyes rose to his third eye</div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s2_44">while solving a problem. Neither Hardy could understand this phenomenon nor would other Western</div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s2_44">mathematicians ever understand it in the future.</div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s2_44">I will tell you about another event in connection with the vermillion mark, so that you will be able to</div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s2_44">understand its relationship to the third eye.</div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s2_44">Edgar Cayce died in 1945. Forty years before that, in 1905, he fell sick, became unconscious and</div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s2_44">remained in a coma for three days. The doctors had lost all hope and said that they could not ﬁnd</div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s2_44">any way to bring him back to consciousness. They thought that his unconsciousness was so deep</div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s2_44">that perhaps he would never come out of it. All medicines were tried, but there were no signs of his</div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s2_44">regaining consciousness.</div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s2_44">On the evening of the third day, the doctors said that they could not do anything more and that</div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s2_44">within four to six hours he would die, or if he lived, he would be mad – which would be worse than</div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s2_44">death – because as time passed the delicate veins and cells of his brain were disintegrating. But</div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s2_44">Cayce suddenly started speaking even though he was in a coma. The doctors couldn’t believe it:</div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s2_44">Cayce’s body was unconscious, but he was speaking. He said that he had fallen from a tree, that</div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s2_44">his backbone was injured, and that was why he was unconscious. He also said that if he was not</div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s2_44">treated within six hours, his brain would be affected and he would die. He suggested some herbal</div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s2_44">medicine which he should be given to drink and said that he then should recover within twelve hours.</div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s2_44">The names of the herbs which he requested were not likely to have been known to Edgar Cayce,</div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s2_44">and at ﬁrst the doctors thought what he was saying was just part of his madness because the</div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s2_44">substances he had suggested were not known to cure a condition such as his.</div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s2_44">but because</div>
<div id="t16_44" class="t s2_44">Cayce had speciﬁcally mentioned them they thought they should try them. Those substances were</div>
<div id="t17_44" class="t s2_44">searched for, and given to Cayce: he fully recovered within twelve hours.</div>
<div id="t18_44" class="t s2_44">Hidden Mysteries</div>
