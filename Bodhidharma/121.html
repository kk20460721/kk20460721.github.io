<div id="t1_121" class="t s1_121">thousand years have passed. Everything has changed and God has sent me as his </div>
<div id="t2_121" class="t s1_121">prophet with a new message." </div>
<div id="t3_121" class="t s1_121">Mohammedans are very fanatic. Omar ordered that this man be tortured for </div>
<div id="t4_121" class="t s1_121">seven days. "Tie him to a pillar, naked, and beat him and don't give him anything </div>
<div id="t5_121" class="t s1_121">to eat. And after seven days I will come and see." </div>
<div id="t6_121" class="t s1_121">So after seven days he went there. The man was almost dying; so much blood </div>
<div id="t7_121" class="t s1_121">had flowed, because they were beating him continuously, and without giving </div>
<div id="t8_121" class="t s1_121">him food. Omar said, "What do you think now? Have you changed your mind or </div>
<div id="t9_121" class="t s1_121">not?" </div>
<div id="ta_121" class="t s1_121">The man laughed and said, "Changed my mind? When I was leaving God, he </div>
<div id="tb_121" class="t s1_121">said to me, `Remember, my prophets are always tortured.' Your torture has </div>
<div id="tc_121" class="t s1_121">proved perfectly that I am the prophet." </div>
<div id="td_121" class="t s1_121">At that very point another man, who had been tied to another pillar for almost </div>
<div id="te_121" class="t s1_121">one month because he was declaring that he himself was God, shouted to Omar, </div>
<div id="tf_121" class="t s1_121">"Don't listen to that idiot. I have never sent any prophet after Mohammed. </div>
<div id="tg_121" class="t s1_121">Mohammed is my only prophet and this man is a cheat!" </div>
<div id="th_121" class="t s1_121">Now what to say about these people? And they are not exceptions. Everybody </div>
<div id="ti_121" class="t s1_121">has some kind of delusion. Everybody is thinking things which he is not. But </div>
<div id="tj_121" class="t s1_121">these delusions are helpful as a lubricating system. It helps your life somehow to </div>
<div id="tk_121" class="t s1_121">move on. </div>
<div id="tl_121" class="t s1_121">Great consolations -- if you cannot become the prime minister, at least you can </div>
<div id="tm_121" class="t s1_121">create a delusion that you are. If you cannot BECOME the richest man you can </div>
<div id="tn_121" class="t s1_121">still believe that you ARE. You can make your delusions so solid that nobody can </div>
<div id="to_121" class="t s1_121">change them. </div>
<div id="tp_121" class="t s1_121">A madman was brought to a psychiatrist. His madness was very special; his </div>
<div id="tq_121" class="t s1_121">madness was that he had been thinking that he had died. So when his family </div>
<div id="tr_121" class="t s1_121">would tell him to go to the shop, tend the shop, he would say, "You don't </div>
<div id="ts_121" class="t s1_121">understand. Dead people don't go to the shop. They don't tend shops." </div>
<div id="tt_121" class="t s1_121">They tried hard in every way to persuade him that he was perfectly alive, and he </div>
<div id="tu_121" class="t s1_121">would say, "How can I believe you when I know that I'm dead?" </div>
<div id="tv_121" class="t s1_121">Finally they brought him to the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist said, "Don't be </div>
<div id="tw_121" class="t s1_121">worried. I will put him right." And he asked the madman, "Do you think dead </div>
<div id="tx_121" class="t s1_121">people bleed?" </div>
<div id="ty_121" class="t s1_121">The madman said, "No, dead people never bleed." </div>
<div id="tz_121" class="t s1_121">So the psychiatrist said, "There is a simple experiment to be done." And he took </div>
<div id="t10_121" class="t s1_121">his knife and cut the dead man's finger just a little bit, and blood came running </div>
<div id="t11_121" class="t s1_121">out. The family was very happy that this man, within a minute, had changed the </div>
<div id="t12_121" class="t s1_121">whole situation. But they never knew that delusions are not so easily dispelled. </div>
<div id="t13_121" class="t s1_121">The madman laughed. The psychiatrist said, "That blood shows that you are not </div>
<div id="t14_121" class="t s1_121">dead." </div>
<div id="t15_121" class="t s1_121">He said, "No, that blood shows that the proverb that `dead men don't bleed' is </div>
<div id="t16_121" class="t s1_121">wrong; they do bleed. I am the proof. Now what can you do? The proverb is </div>
<div id="t17_121" class="t s1_121">wrong and I am the proof of its being wrong. Dead men do bleed!" </div>
