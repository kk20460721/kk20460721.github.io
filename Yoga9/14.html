<div id="t1_14" class="t s1_14">It is not necessarily so, that yogis should do it. Buddhas have never been known to do it. </div>
<div id="t2_14" class="t s1_14">Patanjali himself has not been known to do it. What Patanjali is saying: he is revealing all </div>
<div id="t3_14" class="t s1_14">the possibilities. </div>
<div id="t4_14" class="t s1_14">In fact a man who has attained to his uttermost being, for what will he think to become </div>
<div id="t5_14" class="t s1_14">small? For what? He can't be so foolish. For what? For what would he like to become like </div>
<div id="t6_14" class="t s1_14">an elephant? What is the point in it? And why should he want to disappear? He cannot be </div>
<div id="t7_14" class="t s1_14">interested in amusing people, their curiosities. He is not a magician. He is not interested </div>
<div id="t8_14" class="t s1_14">in people applauding him. For what? In fact the moment a person reaches to the highest </div>
<div id="t9_14" class="t s1_14">peak of his being, all desires disappear. Siddhis appear when desires disappear. This is </div>
<div id="ta_14" class="t s1_14">the dilemma: powers come when you don't want to use them. In fact they come only </div>
<div id="tb_14" class="t s1_14">when the person has disappeared who always wanted to have them. </div>
<div id="tc_14" class="t s1_14">So Patanjali is not saying that yogis will do such things. They have never been known to </div>
<div id="td_14" class="t s1_14">do such things. And the few people who try to do them are not yogis. And the few people </div>
<div id="te_14" class="t s1_14">who do them, in fact cannot do them; they are only tricksters. </div>
<div id="tf_14" class="t s1_14">Now Satya Sai Baba type people go on materializing Swiss-made watches. These are all </div>
<div id="tg_14" class="t s1_14">tricks, and nobody should be enchanted by these trick4. Whatsoever Satya Sai Baba has </div>
<div id="th_14" class="t s1_14">been doing can be done by thousands of magicians all over the world, very easily, but </div>
<div id="ti_14" class="t s1_14">you never go to magicians and touch their feet because you know that they are doing </div>
<div id="tj_14" class="t s1_14">tricks. But if somebody who is thought to be religious is doing the same trick, then you </div>
<div id="tk_14" class="t s1_14">think it is a miracle. </div>
<div id="tl_14" class="t s1_14">This part of Patanjali's YOGA SUTRAS is to make you aware that these things become </div>
<div id="tm_14" class="t s1_14">possible but they are never actualized because the person who would want it, who would </div>
<div id="tn_14" class="t s1_14">have always liked to go on an ego trip through these powers, is there no more. </div>
<div id="to_14" class="t s1_14">Miraculous powers happen to you when you are not interested in them. This is the </div>
<div id="tp_14" class="t s1_14">economy of existence. If you desire, you remain impotent; if you don't desire, you </div>
<div id="tq_14" class="t s1_14">become infinitely potent. This I call the law of banking: if you don't have money, no bank </div>
<div id="tr_14" class="t s1_14">is going to give you; if you have money, every bank is ready to give you. When you don't </div>
<div id="ts_14" class="t s1_14">need, all is available; when you are needy, nothing is available. </div>
<div id="tt_14" class="t s1_14">BEAUTY, GRACE, STRENGTH, AND ADAMANTINE HARDNESS </div>
<div id="tu_14" class="t s1_14">CONSTITUTE THE PERFECT BODY. </div>
<div id="tv_14" class="t s1_14">Patanjali is not talking about this body. This body can be beautiful, but can never be </div>
<div id="tw_14" class="t s1_14">perfectly beautiful. The second body can be more beautiful than this, the third even more, </div>
<div id="tx_14" class="t s1_14">because they are moving closer to the center. The beauty is of the center. The farther </div>
<div id="ty_14" class="t s1_14">away it has to travel, the more limited it becomes. The fourth body is even more </div>
<div id="tz_14" class="t s1_14">beautiful. The fifth is almost ninety-nine percent perfect. </div>
<div id="t10_14" class="t s1_14">But that which is your being, the real you, is beauty, grace, strength, and adamantine </div>
<div id="t11_14" class="t s1_14">hardness. It is adamantine hardness and at the same time the softness of a lotus. It is </div>
<div id="t12_14" class="t s1_14">beautiful but not fragile -- strong. It is strong, but not just hard. All opposites meet in it... </div>
<div id="t13_14" class="t s1_14">as if a lotus flower is made of diamonds or a diamond is made of lotus flowers. Because </div>
<div id="t14_14" class="t s1_14">man and woman meet there and transcend. Because sun and moon meet there and </div>
<div id="t15_14" class="t s1_14">transcend. </div>
<div id="t16_14" class="t s1_14">The old term for yoga is hatha. This word hatha is very, very significant. Ha means sun, </div>
<div id="t17_14" class="t s1_14">tha means moon; and hatha means the meeting of sun and moon. The union of sun and </div>
<div id="t18_14" class="t s1_14">moon is yoga -- UNIO MYSTICA. </div>
