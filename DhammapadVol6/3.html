<div id="t1_3" class="t s1_3">tortured.' And I was doubting, 'Why are people not torturing me if I am the real </div>
<div id="t2_3" class="t s1_3">messenger?' You have proved it! God was right, there was no need to doubt." </div>
<div id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">The caliph was at a loss -- what to say to this madman? But suddenly another man who </div>
<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">was also bound to another pillar started laughing hysterically. The caliph asked him, </div>
<div id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">"Why are you laughing?" </div>
<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">The man said, "This guy is a cheat -- because I am God myself, and I have never sent </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">this man to the world as my messenger!" </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">That man had been imprisoned one month before, declaring himself God. </div>
<div id="t9_3" class="t s1_3">Mohammedans are very fanatic; they can't allow -- sometimes even when it is the truth. </div>
<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">When al-Hillaj Mansoor declared, "ANA'L HAQ! -- I am God himself!" it was a truth, he </div>
<div id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">was not dreaming. But he was crucified. When Sarmad, another Sufi mystic, declared, "I </div>
<div id="tc_3" class="t s1_3">am God!" his head was cut off. And these people were not dreaming. But it is very </div>
<div id="td_3" class="t s1_3">difficult from the outside to decide who is dreaming, who has gone mad, who is </div>
<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">imagining, and who is declaring the truth. Because sometimes the dreamer believes in </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">his dream, believes absolutely, so belief cannot prove anything. It may be just an ego </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">trip. </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">The last deception that the mind can play on you is to say to you, "Why are you </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">unnecessarily bothering? You are a buddha!" And I want you to be aware of it, because </div>
<div id="tj_3" class="t s1_3">this is going to happen to many people. People can believe anything. </div>
<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">Just the other day a man wrote a letter to me saying, "I want to become a sannyasin, but </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">I am a little afraid because I know that I am a Judas and I will prove to be a Judas to </div>
<div id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">you." People can believe they are Christ, they can believe they are Judas. And he must </div>
<div id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">be believing it really deeply. </div>
<div id="to_3" class="t s1_3">I have sent him a message that "You can become a sannyasin. I already have many other </div>
<div id="tp_3" class="t s1_3">Judases, so what difference does it make? One more is welcome!" Jesus had only one </div>
<div id="tq_3" class="t s1_3">Judas: I have many, and it is better to have many -- one can prove more dangerous. If </div>
<div id="tr_3" class="t s1_3">you have many Judases, first they will have to compete with each other. Their energies </div>
<div id="ts_3" class="t s1_3">will be wasted amongst themselves. They will fight with each other; they will betray </div>
<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">each other first. And Judas could betray Jesus because Jesus had only twelve disciples; I </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">have one hundred thousand disciples. </div>
<div id="tv_3" class="t s1_3">I cannot take too much care as to who is a Judas and who is not; and I need not, because </div>
<div id="tw_3" class="t s1_3">whatsoever happens is God's will. If a Judas is needed then he will have to come, that is </div>
<div id="tx_3" class="t s1_3">the way God wants it to be. But your mind can play tricks with you. You can't just be a </div>
<div id="ty_3" class="t s1_3">nobody -- if you cannot be Christ, at least you can be Judas. You can't accept the fact of </div>
<div id="tz_3" class="t s1_3">anonymity. </div>
<div id="t10_3" class="t s1_3">And that is the very fundamental -- the first basic requirement, to enter into the world </div>
<div id="t11_3" class="t s1_3">of religion: to accept oneself as anonymous, as if you have no name, no form, no </div>
<div id="t12_3" class="t s1_3">identity. Then the mind cannot deceive you. Then the mind cannot seduce you into </div>
<div id="t13_3" class="t s1_3">some idea, into some imagination. </div>
<div id="t14_3" class="t s1_3">Buddha is talking about what happens when a person becomes awakened. Ordinarily </div>
<div id="t15_3" class="t s1_3">man is asleep, all men are asleep. Irrespective of their religion, nation, race, on one thing </div>
<div id="t16_3" class="t s1_3">they all agree: they are all fast asleep -- dreaming different dreams, but the sleep is the </div>
