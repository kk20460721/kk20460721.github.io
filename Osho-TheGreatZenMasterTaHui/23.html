<div id="t1_23" class="t s1_23">In ancient India, and even now in the South of India, the temples are nothing but</div>
<div id="t2_23" class="t s1_23">whorehouses. It was a custom that everybody should donate his eldest daughter to God, but</div>
<div id="t3_23" class="t s1_23">God is just a stone statue; the priest exploits the poor woman sexually, in the name of God.</div>
<div id="t4_23" class="t s1_23">Then so many women start gathering in the temple, and rich people start coming to the</div>
<div id="t5_23" class="t s1_23">temple. These women are called devadasis, servants of God, but their actual function is to</div>
<div id="t6_23" class="t s1_23">attract the rich people to the temple. They function as religious prostitutes, and because of</div>
<div id="t7_23" class="t s1_23">them the temple goes on becoming richer and richer.</div>
<div id="t8_23" class="t s1_23">You will be surprised to know that just a few days ago, in Bombay, a survey was made of</div>
<div id="t9_23" class="t s1_23">the prostitutes. Thirty percent were found to be devadasis from the temples of South India,</div>
<div id="ta_23" class="t s1_23">because if the priest finds someone beautiful enough, then it is better to sell her in the Bombay</div>
<div id="tb_23" class="t s1_23">market rather than keep her in the temple. That way the priest can get a lump sum of money.</div>
<div id="tc_23" class="t s1_23">Thirty percent of the prostitutes that were offered to God had reached the market of the</div>
<div id="td_23" class="t s1_23">prostitutes in Bombay. And no Hindu has objected to it -- not even today. The government</div>
<div id="te_23" class="t s1_23">takes no notice. It continues because nobody wants to irritate anybody, nobody wants to annoy</div>
<div id="tf_23" class="t s1_23">anybody. Everybody is trying to look good in other people's eyes.</div>
<div id="tg_23" class="t s1_23">Millions of women in this country have been burned alive! They had to die with their</div>
<div id="th_23" class="t s1_23">husbands; they had to jump onto the funeral pyre with the dead husband. That was called the</div>
<div id="ti_23" class="t s1_23">tradition of suttee. Those women who managed this suicide -- a very painful suicide -- were</div>
<div id="tj_23" class="t s1_23">called great women, very religious women.</div>
<div id="tk_23" class="t s1_23">But the real idea behind it was not religious; there was nothing good in it. The real idea</div>
<div id="tl_23" class="t s1_23">behind it was that the man does not want that his wife, when he is dead ... who knows? She</div>
<div id="tm_23" class="t s1_23">may fall in love with somebody else. He wants to keep her as his possession even after death.</div>
<div id="tn_23" class="t s1_23">So the only way is -- because leaving her he cannot trust -- that she should also die with him,</div>
<div id="to_23" class="t s1_23">just to satisfy his masochistic, male chauvinistic, stupid idea of being the owner.</div>
<div id="tp_23" class="t s1_23">They respected these women, they made memorials for them. I have been asking</div>
<div id="tq_23" class="t s1_23">shankaracharyas and learned and wise Hindu monks, "If this is the case, why has not one</div>
<div id="tr_23" class="t s1_23">single man in the whole history jumped with his wife when she has died?" And they have</div>
<div id="ts_23" class="t s1_23">nothing to answer. They simply look embarrassed, they want to change the subject. But with</div>
<div id="tt_23" class="t s1_23">me it is very difficult to change the subject! I said, "If it is something great, then man has</div>
<div id="tu_23" class="t s1_23">proved himself lower than women."</div>
<div id="tv_23" class="t s1_23">But the truth is that man has always thought that he is the master, and the woman is the</div>
<div id="tw_23" class="t s1_23">possession -- why should he die for the possession? He can have as many women as he wants.</div>
<div id="tx_23" class="t s1_23">In fact, in ancient India women were sold in the marketplaces -- as they were sold all over</div>
<div id="ty_23" class="t s1_23">the world -- as slaves. And you will be surprised that the great Hindu saints, sages -- because</div>
<div id="tz_23" class="t s1_23">nobody looks behind the curtain -- even they were going into the places where women were</div>
<div id="t10_23" class="t s1_23">auctioned, and they were purchasing women.</div>
<div id="t11_23" class="t s1_23">They had wives and alongside they had purchased women. For these purchased women a</div>
<div id="t12_23" class="t s1_23">special word was used. For the wife the word is patni and for the purchased woman the word</div>
<div id="t13_23" class="t s1_23">is vadhu. Now the distinction is lost, because now there is no auction place for women.</div>
<div id="t14_23" class="t s1_23">But it was accepted as being perfectly right. Even the so-called seers, saints, whom you</div>
<div id="t15_23" class="t s1_23">would think have gone beyond all worldly things, were not so sensitive as to have revolted</div>
<div id="t16_23" class="t s1_23">against this brutal process of auctioning women, purchasing them just like any other thing you</div>
<div id="t17_23" class="t s1_23">purchase in the market.</div>
<div id="t18_23" class="t s1_23">What is right? And what is wrong?</div>
<div id="t19_23" class="t s1_23">Chapter 2 - Insight</div>
<div id="t1a_23" class="t s1_23">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
