<div id="t2_144" class="t s1_144">developing, the guests came to suspect that he was an imitator, perhaps a fraud </div>
<div id="t3_144" class="t s1_144">Several of them felt uncomfortable in his presence. He seemed to do nothing to </div>
<div id="t4_144" class="t s1_144">harmonize himself with the atmosphere, and didn't even contribute a proverb to </div>
<div id="t5_144" class="t s1_144">the enlightened conversation which they had come to prize as a necessary part of </div>

<div id="t9_144" class="t s1_144">One day the dervish spoke. He said, "I invite all of you to visit my monastery. </div>
<div id="ta_144" class="t s1_144">Tomorrow night you shall eat with me." </div>
<div id="tb_144" class="t s1_144">This unexpected invitation caused a change in the opinions of the whole </div>
<div id="tc_144" class="t s1_144">assembly. Some thought that the dervish, who was very poorly dressed, must be </div>
<div id="td_144" class="t s1_144">mad, and surely could provide them with nothing. Others considered his past </div>
<div id="te_144" class="t s1_144">behavior to have been a test. At last, they said to themselves, he would reward </div>
<div id="tf_144" class="t s1_144">them for their patience in bearing with such dreary company. Still others said to </div>
<div id="tg_144" class="t s1_144">one another. "Beware, for he may well be trying to lure us into his power." </div>
<div id="th_144" class="t s1_144">Curiosity led them all, including their host, to accept the hospitality. The </div>
<div id="ti_144" class="t s1_144">following evening the dervish led them from the house to a hidden monastery of </div>
<div id="tj_144" class="t s1_144">such size and magnificence that they were dazed. The building was full of </div>
<div id="tk_144" class="t s1_144">disciples carrying out every kind of exercise and task. The guests passed through </div>
<div id="tl_144" class="t s1_144">contemplation halls filled with distinguished-looking sages who rose in respect </div>
<div id="tm_144" class="t s1_144">and bowed at the dervish's approach. The feast which they were given surpassed </div>
<div id="tn_144" class="t s1_144">all powers of description. The visitors were overwhelmed. All begged him to </div>
<div id="to_144" class="t s1_144">enroll them as disciples forthwith. But the dervish would only say to all their </div>

<div id="tq_144" class="t s1_144">Morning came and the guests, instead of waking in the luxurious silken beds to </div>

<div id="tv_144" class="t s1_144">"The infamous wretch has tricked us with the deceits of sorcery!" shouted the </div>
<div id="tw_144" class="t s1_144">guests. They alternately condoled with and congratulated one another for their </div>
<div id="tx_144" class="t s1_144">sufferings and for having at least seen through the villain, whose enchantments </div>
<div id="ty_144" class="t s1_144">obviously wore off before he could achieve his evil purpose, whatever that might </div>
<div id="tz_144" class="t s1_144">be. </div>
<div id="t10_144" class="t s1_144">Many of them attributed their escape to their own purity of mind. But what they </div>

<div id="t12_144" class="t s1_144">experience of the monastery, the dervish had made them believe that they were </div>
<div id="t13_144" class="t s1_144">abandoned in a ruin. They were in fact in neither place. </div>
<div id="t14_144" class="t s1_144">He now approached the company as if from nowhere and said, "We shall return </div>
<div id="t15_144" class="t s1_144">to the monastery." He waved his hands and all found themselves back in the </div>
