<div id="t1_103" class="t s1_103">With a smile, the devil opened the last door. The man was amazed and relieved, </div>
<div id="t2_103" class="t s1_103">as the people were walking around in one foot of cow manure, drinking coffee </div>
<div id="t3_103" class="t s1_103">and chatting pleasantly. </div>
<div id="t4_103" class="t s1_103">The man said, "This is for me," and began socializing. </div>
<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">A few minutes later one of the assistant devils came and called, "Coffee break is </div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">over. Back on your heads!" </div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s1_103">So all happiness you know is just a coffee break, and again on your heads! </div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s1_103">Just momentary allurements</div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s1_103">....</div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s1_103">Months and years of misery, and then there comes a small moment. And again </div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s1_103">you desire that moment, and you are ready to suffer again. And even that </div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s1_103">moment has nothing much in it. If you look into it you will find it hollow inside. </div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s1_103">Has what you call pleasure really anything substantial in it? Or is it just a hope </div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">so that you can carry on somehow in this hell? Without hope it would be too </div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">difficult. If there were no hope, how would you live? Even one day would be </div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">difficult; even to get out of the bed in the morning would be difficult. For what? </div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">The question will arise, "Why? Why to get up again, and why to go the office </div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s1_103">again, and to the same rotten routine, and the same boss, and the same wife, and </div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">the same kids? For what? Enough is enough!" You will simply relax and die in </div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s1_103">your bed. What is the point in getting out of it? But the hope that that which has </div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s1_103">not happened may happen today... "Maybe the opportunity has now come for </div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s1_103">that which has not happened yet. One should be up and take the opportunity as </div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s1_103">it comes." </div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s1_103">And it never comes really. All pleasure is in waiting, in hoping. All pleasure is in </div>
<div id="tp_103" class="t s1_103">the future, in desire; it is never a reality. And you call it real? </div>
<div id="tq_103" class="t s1_103">My bliss is not in hope. I am not hoping for anything, I have abandoned all hope. </div>
<div id="tr_103" class="t s1_103">In fact, the day I abandoned all hope the reality happened to me. Through hope </div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s1_103">you don't allow reality to happen. The day you drop desiring, a great bliss </div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s1_103">descends on you. It was always there, but because of your desiring you were </div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s1_103">missing it. You were so constantly occupied with desire that you were not </div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">available to it, you were closed. Once desiring disappears you are open, you </div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">become available. </div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">I have known your reality. I have lived in that misery as long as you have lived </div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">in it -- for millennia, for many lives. Certainly it is difficult to believe in my bliss, </div>
<div id="tz_103" class="t s1_103">in my truth. And the question arises, "This man may be dreaming." </div>
<div id="t10_103" class="t s1_103">But one thing I would like to say to you: even if this is a dream, even if it appears </div>
<div id="t11_103" class="t s1_103">like a dream, it is better than your reality. Try it. You have nothing to lose -- but </div>
<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">still you are so afraid of losing it. Maybe you are so afraid of losing it so that you </div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">can go on thinking that you have something. The fear that you may lose it keeps </div>
<div id="t14_103" class="t s1_103">you feeling that you have something to lose. But have you looked in your </div>
<div id="t15_103" class="t s1_103">pocket? There is nothing. In fact there is a big hole. Your pocket holds nothing. </div>
<div id="t16_103" class="t s1_103">But afraid that you may come across the truth, you never look in your pocket. </div>
