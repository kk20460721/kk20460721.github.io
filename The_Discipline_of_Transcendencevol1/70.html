<div id="t1_70" class="t s1_70">Love is born in sexuality but sexuality is not love. The lotus is born in the mud, </div>
<div id="t2_70" class="t s1_70">but the lotus is not just mud. And if mud remains mud of course there are bound </div>
<div id="t3_70" class="t s1_70">to be tears on the cheeks. </div>
<div id="t4_70" class="t s1_70">You are waiting to become a lotus, you are waiting to flower in higher space, and </div>
<div id="t5_70" class="t s1_70">you remain rooted. This is happening down the centuries. There have been very </div>
<div id="t6_70" class="t s1_70">few individuals who attained to love. Then they have smiles on their faces, then </div>
<div id="t7_70" class="t s1_70">you can see the grace, the beauty, the beauty of the unknown descending in </div>
<div id="t8_70" class="t s1_70">them. Love transforms. </div>
<div id="t9_70" class="t s1_70">Sex at the most is a release. Hygienic, healthy, I'm not against it, it's natural, but it </div>
<div id="ta_70" class="t s1_70">is not the end, just the beginning. It is the very alphabet of love, but you have to </div>
<div id="tb_70" class="t s1_70">make poetry out of it. All the poetry can be reduced to the alphabet. </div>
<div id="tc_70" class="t s1_70">It happened once that a friend of Mark Twain's, a great religious preacher, </div>
<div id="td_70" class="t s1_70">invited him to come to his talk. He had been inviting him many times down the </div>
<div id="te_70" class="t s1_70">years and Mark Twain would not go, but that day he said, 'Okay, I am coming.' </div>
<div id="tf_70" class="t s1_70">The priest prepared his talk, as beautiful a talk as he had ever delivered -- and he </div>
<div id="tg_70" class="t s1_70">was a great preacher. Thousands of people listened to him in deep rapture. Mark </div>
<div id="th_70" class="t s1_70">Twain was just sitting in front of him, and that was his climax. The audience was </div>
<div id="ti_70" class="t s1_70">spell-bound, as if there was nobody... there was such dense silence -- and the </div>
<div id="tj_70" class="t s1_70">speaker was again and again looking from the corner of his eyes at Mark Twain, </div>
<div id="tk_70" class="t s1_70">at what was happening to him -- and he was sitting there, bored! </div>
<div id="tl_70" class="t s1_70">When they were going back in the car, for a few minutes the preacher could not </div>
<div id="tm_70" class="t s1_70">gather courage to ask. Then eventually when Mark Twain was getting out of the </div>
<div id="tn_70" class="t s1_70">car at his house, he asked, 'Can I ask you how it was? Did you like it?' </div>
<div id="to_70" class="t s1_70">Mark Twain said, 'All nonsense and all borrowed. By chance I have been reading </div>
<div id="tp_70" class="t s1_70">a book these days and all that you said is in that book.' </div>
<div id="tq_70" class="t s1_70">The preacher could not believe, because he had not copied from anywhere. </div>
<div id="tr_70" class="t s1_70">Maybe a few sentences could be found here and there, but the whole speech? </div>
<div id="ts_70" class="t s1_70">And Mark Twain said, 'Word by word, you have simply repeated. It is a </div>
<div id="tt_70" class="t s1_70">robbery.' </div>
<div id="tu_70" class="t s1_70">The preacher said, 'I would like to see the book.' </div>
<div id="tv_70" class="t s1_70">The next day Mark Twain sent him the book. It was a dictionary. Of course, in a </div>
<div id="tw_70" class="t s1_70">dictionary every word is there. </div>
<div id="tx_70" class="t s1_70">Every poem can be reduced to the alphabet, but poetry is not just alphabet. All </div>
<div id="ty_70" class="t s1_70">Buddha's sayings can be reduced to the alphabet, but those sayings are not just </div>
<div id="tz_70" class="t s1_70">alphabet. That's what Freud has done -- he has reduced all love into sex. </div>
<div id="t10_70" class="t s1_70">Sex is only the alphabet of love, bricks out of which you can make a Taj Mahal. </div>
<div id="t11_70" class="t s1_70">But Taj Mahal is not just bricks. You can pile up bricks; it will not become a Taj </div>
<div id="t12_70" class="t s1_70">Mahal. Taj Mahal is a composition of infinite love, of infinite creativity. Bricks are </div>
<div id="t13_70" class="t s1_70">only the visible part of it. Taj Mahal is something invisible. Bricks have made that </div>
<div id="t14_70" class="t s1_70">invisible visible in a certain way and you can feel it. Bricks help the invisible to </div>
<div id="t15_70" class="t s1_70">be felt, but the bricks are not the invisible. </div>
<div id="t16_70" class="t s1_70">Sex is just like bricks. And if you go on piling sex, one is bound to feel in tears. </div>
<div id="t17_70" class="t s1_70">The woman must have been a woman of deep understanding. </div>
