<div id="t1_54" class="t s1_54">and for centuries. It would have been more convenient because you need not inquire, </div>
<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">you need not go through the whole effort of finding the truth. It has been found by </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">some seer in the past -- you can simply borrow it. But a borrowed truth is not a truth at </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">all. A borrowed truth is a lie. </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">Buddha went on a search; arduous was the inquiry. He risked all -- his kingdom, his </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">life. But when you risk so much, life showers new treasures on you. A new religion, a </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">new insight, a new vision, was born into the world. </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">Mohammed could have followed his parents' religion. Jesus could have followed </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">Judaism. Become a Jesus, become a Buddha, become a Mohammed! Don't be a </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">Mohammedan and don't be a Buddhist and don't be a Christian -- explore! Don't waste </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">life in imitating, because then you will remain pseudo. And a pseudo person cannot be </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">religious. Great authenticity, sincerity is needed. </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">So, Geetam, it is good that there are three hundred religions -- there should be more! I </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">am always for variety. I want the world richer in every possible way. Would you like </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">the whole world to have only one kind of flower -- just roses, or just lotuses? Will it not </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">be an impoverished world, very poor? Would you like the world to have only one </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">language? Then the different nuances of the different languages will disappear. </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">There are things which can be said only in Arabic and cannot be said in any other </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">language; and there are things which can be said only in Hebrew and cannot be said in </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">any other language. There are things which can be said only in Chinese and cannot be </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">said in any other language. If the world has only one language, many many beautiful </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">things will remain unsaid. </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">Lao Tzu can speak only Chinese. You may not have pondered over the problem: just </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">think of Lao Tzu writing his TAO TEH CHING in English...and the book will be totally </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">different. It will miss something of immense value; it will have something different, a </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">totally different color to it, but it will miss the flavor that it has in Chinese. </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">Now, Chinese has no alphabet; it is written in symbols. Because there is no alphabet, </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">symbols can be interpreted in a thousand and one ways; symbols are more fluid, less </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">fixed, more poetic, less prosaic. One symbol can mean many things. It is not scientific; it </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">is very difficult to write scientific treatises in Chinese. For that, English is a far more </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">adequate language. </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">But what Lao Tzu has given to the world would not have been possible without </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">Chinese. Each symbol has many meanings, a multiplicity of meanings. You can choose </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">your meaning according to your state of mind. Each symbol has many layers of </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">meaning. As you grow in your understanding, the meaning of the symbols changes. </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">Hence, in the East a totally different kind of reading has existed which is nonexistent in </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">the West. You would not like to read the same Bernard Shaw book again and again and </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">again, or would you? Unless you are insane you would not like to read it again and </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">again and again. What is the point? Once you have read it, it is finished! That's why the </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">paperback has come into existence: read it and throw it. But in the East a different kind </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">of reading exists: the same book is read again and again the whole life long. </div>
<div id="t16_54" class="t s1_54">The TAO TEH CHING is not a book which can be published in paperback -- they are </div>
<div id="t17_54" class="t s1_54">doing that now. It should not be published in paperback -- it cannot be, because it is a </div>
