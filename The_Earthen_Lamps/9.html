<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">CHAPTER 1.</div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s2_9">would listen to religious discourses and discussions. He would sit in the company of good people</div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s2_9">and the saints. Because of him there was a gathering of the saints daily in that house. On account</div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s2_9">of his attention to God and the saints he had become entitled to heavens in the other world. This</div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s2_9">was that the good men and the saints explained to him, and this was written in the scriptures also</div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s2_9">because those scriptures were also made by the group of those good men and saints. On the one</div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s2_9">hand, he exploited wealth and on the other he would give charities and do good things. Heaven</div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s2_9">cannot be attained without charities. There is no wealth without exploitation. There is wealth from</div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s2_9">the opposite of religion and there is religion from wealth. He exploited others, the good men and</div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s2_9">the saints exploited him; and the exploiters have always been good friends. But he always pitied</div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s2_9">his younger brother. He was no good at collecting money and consequently was getting unable to</div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s2_9">collect religion either. His behaviour, full of love and truth, was coming in the way of his reaching</div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s2_9">God. Then, he was neither going to the temple nor did he know the A, B, C, of the scriptures. His</div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s2_9">condition was deﬁnitely pitiable and his account in the other world was blank. He used to avoid the</div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s2_9">good men and the saints also, as people would avoid infectious diseases. If the saints entered the</div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s2_9">house from one gate, he would go out from the other. His religious brother used to request many</div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s2_9">saints to change the heart of his irreligious brother. But there could be a change only if he would</div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s2_9">stay near the saints. He would not stay. But one day a full-ﬂedged and a real saint came there. No</div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s2_9">one knows how many irreligious people he had converted into the religious. He was an adept in the</div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s2_9">theories of peace, persuasion, threat and division. It was his profession to convert people to religion.</div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s2_9">It is on such saints that the foundations of religion rest. Otherwise, religion would have disappeared</div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s2_9">long ago. When the elder brother repeated his request to him also, he said: ”Do not worry. That fool</div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s2_9">will now be in trouble. I will now see that he remembers God. What I say, I always fulﬁl”. Saying so,</div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s2_9">he took up his stick and accompanied the elder brother. He was a wrestler in the past. Thereafter,</div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s2_9">ﬁnding saintliness as a better profession than wrestling, he became a saint. He caught hold of the</div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s2_9">younger brother immediately on arrival. Not only did he catch him, but he felled him down on the</div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s2_9">ground and sat down on his chest. That young man was not able to understand anything. He was</div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s2_9">speechless out of surprise. Even so he said: ”Sir, what is this?” The saint said: ”Change of heart”.</div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s2_9">That young man laughed and said; ’Please leave this aside. Is this a way to change the heart?”</div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s2_9">Please take care. You may not get hurt in the body; The saint said: ”we do not believe in the body;</div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s2_9">we believe in God. Say ’Ram’ and then alone I will leave you. Otherwise, you will ﬁnd no one worse</div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s2_9">than I”. The saint was very generous and, therefore, in the interest of the young man he descended</div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s2_9">to the level of thrashing him. That young man said: ”What relation is there between fear and God?</div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s2_9">and does God have a name? I will not say ’Ram’ like this whether I live or not” and then he pushed</div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s2_9">down the saint. After his fall, the saint said: ”Wonderful, Wonderful!! You have said what you had</div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s2_9">to say!!! Even in saying that I will not say ’Ram’, you have uttered his name. His brother was very</div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s2_9">angry with him because the saint was toppled; but he was very much pleased with the saint. He</div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s2_9">had made his atheist brother utter the name of God. The glory of the name of ’Ram’ is so great that</div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s2_9">uttering his name once even by mistake will take a person beyond the sea of this life. That day he</div>
<div id="t14_9" class="t s2_9">gave a feast to the whole town. After all, his younger brother had turned religious!</div>
<div id="t15_9" class="t s2_9">6.</div>
<div id="t16_9" class="t s2_9">Believers in one god have broken the idols of the other god. In truth, it is nothing new. It has been</div>
<div id="t17_9" class="t s2_9">happening all along. Only men are not rivals of one another, even their Gods are. In fact, the gods</div>
<div id="t18_9" class="t s2_9">that man creates cannot be very much different from what they themselves are. One temple stands</div>
<div id="t19_9" class="t s2_9">against another because one man is opposed to another. One scripture is the enemy of another</div>
<div id="t1a_9" class="t s2_9">because one man is the enemy of the other. As the man is, so is his religion. Where the man is,</div>
<div id="t1b_9" class="t s2_9">The Earthen Lamps</div>
<div id="t1c_9" class="t s2_9">9</div>
<div id="t1d_9" class="t s3_9">Osho</div>
