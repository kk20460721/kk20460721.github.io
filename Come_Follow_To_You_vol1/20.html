<div id="t1_20" class="t s1_20">But because of him</div>
<div id="t2_20" class="t s1_20">....</div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">And Jesus was to follow him, Jesus was a disciple of his </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">own disciple. He was initiated by John the Baptist because John the Baptist </div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s1_20">preceded him. He became linked. Then he had to use the same terminology. It </div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s1_20">was almost certain that he would be misunderstood. </div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s1_20">John the Baptist died in prison, beheaded. Jesus died on the cross -- killed, </div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">murdered. John the Baptist was also talking about the kingdom of God. Of </div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">course he was not aggressive, but the very terminology appeared political. He </div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">was a very innocent man, nothing to do with politics. </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">But John the Baptist helped in a way. Jesus could work because all the disciples </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">of John the Baptist were ready to receive him, he was not a stranger. John the </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">Baptist had created a small opening, a small clearance in the wilderness of </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">humanity. When he came he was received; there was a home ready for him -- a </div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s1_20">few people receptive to him. That would not have been possible if he had come </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s1_20">alone without a predecessor. But the home was made by John the Baptist and the </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">disciples whom he attracted were attracted by him. That created the trouble. </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">This is the oldest format: the Master is preceded by a disciple who functions as a </div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">predecessor and prepares the ground. Because of its defects and limitations, </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">there has been another, the opposite. </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s1_20">Ramakrishna is succeeded by Vivekanand; he is not preceded by anybody. The </div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s1_20">Master comes first, then the disciple follows. This has its own benefits because </div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s1_20">the Master creates the whole climate, the Master creates the whole possibility of </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s1_20">growth -- how the thing is to go. He gives language, pattern, direction, </div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s1_20">dimension. </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s1_20">But there are defects because the Master is infinite and when the disciple comes </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s1_20">he is very finite. Then the disciple has to choose, because he cannot move in all </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">directions. The Master may be showing all the directions, he may be leading you </div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s1_20">towards infinity, but when the disciple comes he has to choose, he has to select, </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s1_20">and then he forces his own pattern on it. </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">Ramakrishna was succeeded by Vivekanand. Ramakrishna is one of the greatest </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">flowerings that has ever happened; Vivekanand is the prophet. Ramakrishna is </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s1_20">the messiah, but Vivekanand set the whole trend. Vivekanand's own inclinations </div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s1_20">were extrovert, not introvert. His own inclinations were more towards social </div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s1_20">reformation, political change. He was more interested in bringing riches to the </div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s1_20">people, destroying poverty and hunger and starvation. He turned the whole </div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s1_20">trend around. </div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s1_20">The Ramakrishna Mission is not true to Ramakrishna; the Ramakrishna Mission </div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s1_20">is true to Vivekanand. Now the Ramakrishna Mission functions as a social </div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s1_20">service. Wherever there is famine, they are there to serve people. Whenever there </div>
<div id="t15_20" class="t s1_20">is an earthquake, they are there to serve people. Whenever there is flood -- and </div>
<div id="t16_20" class="t s1_20">there is no lack of these things in India  -- they are there. They are good servants, </div>
<div id="t17_20" class="t s1_20">but Ramakrishna's inward revolution has completely disappeared into the desert </div>
<div id="t18_20" class="t s1_20">land of Vivekanand. </div>
