<div id="t1_82" class="t s1_82">The whole of psychoanalysis depends on your dreams for clues. When you are awake </div>
<div id="t2_82" class="t s1_82">you are not trustworthy; what you say about yourself is deceptive. In your dreams you </div>
<div id="t3_82" class="t s1_82">are more innocent, because there is nobody to control and repress. The conscience is fast </div>
<div id="t4_82" class="t s1_82">asleep, morality is gone; you are more natural, more normal. In your dreams you are </div>
<div id="t5_82" class="t s1_82">purer. Hence psychoanalysis has to depend on your dreams and through your dreams </div>
<div id="t6_82" class="t s1_82">it comes to conclusions about you. </div>
<div id="t7_82" class="t s1_82">This is a very sad state of affairs: that you cannot be trusted at all, because you say one </div>
<div id="t8_82" class="t s1_82">thing and you are totally something else. And it is not that you deliberately try to </div>
<div id="t9_82" class="t s1_82">deceive; deception has almost become your second nature. That's why you immediately </div>
<div id="ta_82" class="t s1_82">forget your dreams; it is a strategy of the mind. Within five seconds of waking up... </div>
<div id="tb_82" class="t s1_82">when you wake up there is a little lingering, a little memory -- just a few fragments, the </div>
<div id="tc_82" class="t s1_82">last parts of your dreams. But within five seconds they are gone. By the time you are out </div>
<div id="td_82" class="t s1_82">of bed all your dreams have disappeared, you have forgotten all about them. Unless </div>
<div id="te_82" class="t s1_82">you make a very conscious effort you will not be able to remember them. This is a </div>
<div id="tf_82" class="t s1_82">strategy of the mind, it simply closes the door, because your dreams can be a </div>
<div id="tg_82" class="t s1_82">disturbance to you. </div>
<div id="th_82" class="t s1_82">If you come to know that in your dream you killed your father it will be heavy on you, </div>
<div id="ti_82" class="t s1_82">you may feel guilty. If you are a very very moralistic, puritanical person and you see </div>
<div id="tj_82" class="t s1_82">that in your dream you had eloped, escaped with the wife of your neighbor and you </div>
<div id="tk_82" class="t s1_82">were enjoying it, you will be disturbed. You will become suspicious about your </div>
<div id="tl_82" class="t s1_82">morality, about your purity. It will hang over you like a dark cloud. </div>
<div id="tm_82" class="t s1_82">The mind simply cuts you off from your dreams. It has created two kinds of worlds: </div>
<div id="tn_82" class="t s1_82">one, the dreaming world, totally separate, and one, the so-called waking world, totally </div>
<div id="to_82" class="t s1_82">separate. You live in compartments. When you enter into dreaming you forget all about </div>
<div id="tp_82" class="t s1_82">waking; when you enter into waking you forget all about dreaming. </div>
<div id="tq_82" class="t s1_82">The buddha is awake even while he is asleep. He has no compartments in his being. He </div>
<div id="tr_82" class="t s1_82">is not many, he is one. Because he is one and he has no clinging to memories and no </div>
<div id="ts_82" class="t s1_82">desires for the future, the present is enough for him. Then he lives moment to moment </div>
<div id="tt_82" class="t s1_82">in its totality; he does not go on living partially. Your dreams simply show that you live </div>
<div id="tu_82" class="t s1_82">partially, and the unlived parts have to be lived in your dreams. If you live totally each </div>
<div id="tv_82" class="t s1_82">moment, then there is no possibility of any dreams. </div>
<div id="tw_82" class="t s1_82">Once it happened: </div>
<div id="tx_82" class="t s1_82">A Sufi came to me, a very beautiful person, and doing Sufi meditation -- ZIKR -- he had </div>
<div id="ty_82" class="t s1_82">become capable of reading other people's thoughts. Some of his disciples, who were </div>
<div id="tz_82" class="t s1_82">known to me, wanted him to come and read my thoughts. </div>
<div id="t10_82" class="t s1_82">I said, "Okay, bring him." </div>
<div id="t11_82" class="t s1_82">The man was really capable. He would simply close his eyes and he would start saying </div>
<div id="t12_82" class="t s1_82">what thoughts are passing within you. For half an hour he remained with closed eyes, </div>
<div id="t13_82" class="t s1_82">very puzzled. Then he finally gave up. He said, "But I don't see anything, just utter </div>
<div id="t14_82" class="t s1_82">emptiness." He said, "This is the first time that I can't read. What have you done to me?" </div>
