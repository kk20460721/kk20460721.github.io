<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">Somewhere deep down you believe it is not a myth, otherwise why? Have a good laugh </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">and it is finished! </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">But your concern to make me aware of the fact that the British lady does not exist... I </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">KNOW it! I am surrounded by British ladies! I have more British ladies around me than </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">I have Jews or Polacks or Italians. I know it is a myth -- but a beautiful myth! </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">And one thing is very good about British ladies: they never disappoint you because </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">from the very beginning they are ice-a box-a. That must be said in their appreciation. </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">The Italian lady begins with a nice-a box-a; ultimately, finally, you find out, but then it </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">is too late, that she is not a nice-a box-a, she is an ice-a boxa. But the British lady from </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">the very beginning is clear; she never disappoints anybody. She is truthful, sincere. If </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">you want an ice-a box-a, it is your responsibility. </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">Buddha says: HE MOVES WITH LOVE AMONG THE UNLOVING</div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">....</div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">Yes, the master </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">has to move among the Polacks and the Italians and the Jews, the British and the </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">French... and he has to move with people who know nothing about love, although they </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">all believe they love. And the love of the master is so different that you cannot </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">understand his love. His love is very cool; to you it appears it is cold because you know </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">only two categories, cold or hot. You don't know the third category: cool, neither cold </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">nor hot. </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">Coolness is not coldness, remember. The master is never cold, but certainly he is not hot </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">either. You know a love which is hot, passionate, lusty, and you know a love which has </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">gone dead, has become cold -- ice-a box-a -- everything has become frozen, it is a corpse. </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">But you don't know the third possibility: the coolness of love and the freshness of that </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">coolness. And the coolness has a paradoxical quality in it. If you compare it with cold, </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">then it is cool; if you compare it with hot, then it is warm. It is exactly in the middle </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">where warmth and coolness are one. The master has a warmth which is cool and has a </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">coolness which is warm, but that is very difficult for people who live in extremes to </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">understand. </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">HE MOVES WITH LOVE AMONG THE UNLOVING, WITH PEACE AND </div>

<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">He loves but he is never attached, and you cannot understand a love </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">which is not attached. To you love and attachment are always associated; it is </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">impossible for you to keep them separate. Love is always attachment to you; the deeper </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">the attachment, the more you think it is love. But the master's love is utterly detached. </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">He loves, yet he is not bound by it. He loves, but he is not binding on you. You know a </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">love which creates excitement. The master's love is utterly peaceful; there is no </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">excitement. It is nothing to do with romance. </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">HE MOVES... AMONG THE HUNGRY</div>

<div id="t17_44" class="t s1_44">The people who are always desiring more, </div>
<div id="t18_44" class="t s1_44">Buddha calls them hungry, constantly hungry. They go on stuffing themselves with </div>
<div id="t19_44" class="t s1_44">every kind of thing and they are never satisfied. Their hunger is impossible, their thirst </div>
