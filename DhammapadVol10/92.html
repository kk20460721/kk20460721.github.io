<div id="t1_92" class="t s1_92">Now Somendra is very angry because I said that he can be a good candidate for Judas. </div>
<div id="t2_92" class="t s1_92">Soon there is going to be a notice: "Wanted: a Judas." And there are many people </div>
<div id="t3_92" class="t s1_92">eligible. Somendra can do the work. He is so angry because I had said that he sits </div>
<div id="t4_92" class="t s1_92">behind keeping his back towards me, so the next day he came to his old place. </div>
<div id="t5_92" class="t s1_92">Today he has disappeared, because today he has asked a very ugly question out of </div>
<div id="t6_92" class="t s1_92">sheer anger. That's why he has disappeared from here. Even though he has been sitting </div>
<div id="t7_92" class="t s1_92">here for two or three days he does not look at me; he keeps his eyes down. He has not </div>
<div id="t8_92" class="t s1_92">been coming to his group therapy darshan many times. Last night he appeared, but he </div>
<div id="t9_92" class="t s1_92">did not look at me... boiling within. Today he has disappeared because of the question. </div>
<div id="ta_92" class="t s1_92">He must have been afraid. He has put the question in somebody else's name -- but you </div>
<div id="tb_92" class="t s1_92">can't deceive me! And the moment I saw that he is not there my suspicion became </div>
<div id="tc_92" class="t s1_92">absolutely certain that it is his question. </div>
<div id="td_92" class="t s1_92">In his question he says, "Are you not a lazy person? And still, what chutzpah you have </div>
<div id="te_92" class="t s1_92">to tell other people to work and be creative." I am not a lazy person -- I am the laziest! </div>
<div id="tf_92" class="t s1_92">And naturally, the laziest person can live only if others work; otherwise how am I going </div>
<div id="tg_92" class="t s1_92">to live? So I go on teaching, "Work, be creative! Clean the floor meditatively! Clean the </div>
<div id="th_92" class="t s1_92">toilets!" That is simple. It is not a question of chutzpah, it is simple logic! A man like me </div>
<div id="ti_92" class="t s1_92">needs at least ten thousand people to work for him! </div>
<div id="tj_92" class="t s1_92">And he asks, "How can you tell others to work?" For a man who has never done </div>
<div id="tk_92" class="t s1_92">anything, everything seems to be possible. Even the impossible seems to be possible. I </div>
<div id="tl_92" class="t s1_92">have never worked, not for a single day. That's why I can say to you to do ANYTHING, </div>
<div id="tm_92" class="t s1_92">because I don't know the trouble. I have no experience about it. </div>
<div id="tn_92" class="t s1_92">Truth hurts. And then it comes in many ways, it expresses itself in many ways. </div>
<div id="to_92" class="t s1_92">Patipada, remember, if anything hurts then meditate over it. There must be something </div>
<div id="tp_92" class="t s1_92">of truth in it, something true. If anything hurts, respect it, go deep into it. Find out why </div>
<div id="tq_92" class="t s1_92">it hurts, and you will be rewarded. You will grow through that. </div>
<div id="tr_92" class="t s1_92">Lies are sweet; they don't hurt. So beware of sweet lies. When something does not hurt </div>
<div id="ts_92" class="t s1_92">you it cannot become an impetus for growth; it is useless, not to be bothered about at </div>
<div id="tt_92" class="t s1_92">all. But pay your total attention to anything that hurts, and don't get angry. You are to </div>
<div id="tu_92" class="t s1_92">understand here, to be aware, not to be angry. </div>
<div id="tv_92" class="t s1_92">Just a few months ago I told Somendra that he had attained his first satori. He was just </div>
<div id="tw_92" class="t s1_92">joy. You should have seen his face that time -- all laughter, all smiles, bubbling with </div>
<div id="tx_92" class="t s1_92">ecstasy! That was easy for him to accept because although it was true, the ego jumped </div>
<div id="ty_92" class="t s1_92">upon it, grabbed it, felt very good -- and that is how he missed it. </div>
<div id="tz_92" class="t s1_92">When truth -- any truth -- becomes an ego trip, you miss it, you lose track of it. And </div>
<div id="t10_92" class="t s1_92">remember: before samadhi happens, before enlightenment happens, you may attain </div>
<div id="t11_92" class="t s1_92">thousands of satoris -- and you may miss them. If one remains very alert when a satori </div>
<div id="t12_92" class="t s1_92">happens, only then he will not miss it. If you become very gratified about it and you </div>
<div id="t13_92" class="t s1_92">start bragging about it in subtle ways, you are bound to miss it. And many people are </div>
<div id="t14_92" class="t s1_92">doing the same. </div>
<div id="t15_92" class="t s1_92">Sometimes it is very difficult for me; even if I see that something beautiful is happening </div>
<div id="t16_92" class="t s1_92">to you I have to control myself not to say it, because there is every danger that just by </div>
<div id="t17_92" class="t s1_92">saying it your ego may feel puffed up. And that will be the point when you will lose it. </div>
