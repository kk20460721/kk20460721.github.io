<div id="t2_49" class="t s1_49">ultimate peak that life attains, the crescendo. </div>
<div id="t3_49" class="t s1_49">But why are we missing life? Why are we aging and not maturing? Somewhere </div>
<div id="t4_49" class="t s1_49">something has gone wrong, somewhere you have been put on a wrong track -- </div>
<div id="t5_49" class="t s1_49">somewhere you have agreed to be put on a wrong track. That agreement has to be broken; </div>
<div id="t6_49" class="t s1_49">that contract has to be burned. That's what I call sannyas: an understanding that up to now </div>
<div id="t7_49" class="t s1_49">I have lived in a wrong way -- I have compromised, not lived, really. </div>
<div id="t8_49" class="t s1_49">When you were small children you compromised. You sold your being. For nothing. </div>
<div id="t9_49" class="t s1_49">What you have gained is simply nothing, just rubbish. For small things you have lost </div>
<div id="ta_49" class="t s1_49">your soul. You have agreed to be somebody else other than yourself; that is where you </div>
<div id="tb_49" class="t s1_49">missed your path. The mother wanted you to become somebody, the father wanted you to </div>
<div id="tc_49" class="t s1_49">become somebody, the society wanted you to become somebody; and you agreed. By and </div>
<div id="td_49" class="t s1_49">by you decided not to be yourself And since then you have been pretending to be </div>
<div id="te_49" class="t s1_49">somebody else. </div>
<div id="tf_49" class="t s1_49">You cannot mature because that somebody else cannot mature. It is false. If I wear a </div>
<div id="tg_49" class="t s1_49">mask, the mask cannot mature. It is dead. My face can mature, but not my mask. And </div>
<div id="th_49" class="t s1_49">only your mask goes on aging. Behind the mask, hiding, you are not growing. You can </div>
<div id="ti_49" class="t s1_49">grow only if you accept yourself -- that you are going to be yourself, nobody else. </div>
<div id="tj_49" class="t s1_49">The rosebush has agreed to become an elephant; the elephant has agreed to become a </div>

<div id="tl_49" class="t s1_49">become the dog; and the dog is hospitalized because he wants to fly like an eagle. This is </div>
<div id="tm_49" class="t s1_49">what has happened to humanity. The greatest calamity is to agree to be somebody else: </div>
<div id="tn_49" class="t s1_49">you can never mature. </div>
<div id="to_49" class="t s1_49">You can never mature like somebody else. You can only mature like you. The "shoulds" </div>
<div id="tp_49" class="t s1_49">have to be dropped, and you have to drop too much concern about what people say. What </div>

<div id="tr_49" class="t s1_49">somebody else's expectations; and everybody is trying that. The father may be dead, and </div>

<div id="tv_49" class="t s1_49">Try to understand, and take courage -- and take your life in your own hands. Suddenly </div>

<div id="tx_49" class="t s1_49">nobody else. Whatsoever the cost, but I am going to be myself," that very moment you </div>
<div id="ty_49" class="t s1_49">will see a great change. You will feel vital. You will feel energy streaming in you, </div>
<div id="tz_49" class="t s1_49">pulsating. </div>
<div id="t10_49" class="t s1_49">Unless that happens, you will be afraid of old age, because how can you avoid seeing the </div>

<div id="t15_49" class="t s1_49">So if you ask me what to do, I will suggest the basic thing. And it is always a question of </div>
<div id="t16_49" class="t s1_49">basics. Never be bothered by secondary things, because you can change them, but </div>
<div id="t17_49" class="t s1_49">nothing will change. Change the basic. </div>
<div id="t18_49" class="t s1_49">For example, what is secondary. "Why am I always afraid of being old? Show me the </div>
<div id="t19_49" class="t s1_49">way how I can get rid of it." The very question is out of fear. You want to "get rid of it," </div>
<div id="t1a_49" class="t s1_49">not to understand, so of course you are going to become a victim of somebody or some </div>
