<div id="t1_130" class="t s1_130">There is a Sufi story: </div>
<div id="t2_130" class="t s1_130">A man heard that if he went to a certain place in the desert at dawn and stood facing a </div>
<div id="t3_130" class="t s1_130">distant mountain, his shadow would point to a great buried treasure. The man left his </div>
<div id="t4_130" class="t s1_130">cabin before the first light of day and at dawn was standing in the designated place. His </div>
<div id="t5_130" class="t s1_130">shadow shot out long and thin over the surface of the sand. "How fortunate," he thought </div>
<div id="t6_130" class="t s1_130">as he envisioned himself with great wealth. He began digging for the treasure. He was so </div>
<div id="t7_130" class="t s1_130">involved with his work that he did not notice the sun climbing in the sky and shortening </div>
<div id="t8_130" class="t s1_130">his shadow, and then he noticed it. It was now almost half of the previous size. He </div>
<div id="t9_130" class="t s1_130">became worried and started digging again in the new spot. Hours later, at noon, the man </div>
<div id="ta_130" class="t s1_130">again stood in the designated spot. He cast no shadow. He became very much worried. </div>
<div id="tb_130" class="t s1_130">He started crying and weeping -- the whole effort lost. Now where is the place? </div>
<div id="tc_130" class="t s1_130">Then there passed a Sufi Master, who started laughing at him and said, "Now exactly the </div>
<div id="td_130" class="t s1_130">shadow is pointing to the treasure. It is within you." </div>
<div id="te_130" class="t s1_130">All paths can lead to it because in a way it is already achieved. It is within you. You are </div>
<div id="tf_130" class="t s1_130">not seeking something new. You are seeking something which you have forgotten. And </div>
<div id="tg_130" class="t s1_130">how can you really forget it? That's why we go on searching for bliss, because we cannot </div>
<div id="th_130" class="t s1_130">forget it. It goes on resounding inside us. The search for bliss, the search for joy, the </div>
<div id="ti_130" class="t s1_130">search for happiness is nothing but the search for God. You may not have used the word </div>
<div id="tj_130" class="t s1_130">"God," that doesn't matter, but all searching for bliss is the search for God -- is the search </div>
<div id="tk_130" class="t s1_130">for something that you knew, that one day was yours and you lost. </div>
<div id="tl_130" class="t s1_130">That's why all the great saints have said "remember." Buddha calls it SAMYAK SMRITI, </div>
<div id="tm_130" class="t s1_130">"right remembrance." Nanak calls it NAM SMARAN, "remembering the name" -- </div>
<div id="tn_130" class="t s1_130">remembering the address. Have you not observed many times it happens ?you know </div>
<div id="to_130" class="t s1_130">something, you say, "It is exactly on the tip of my tongue," but still it is not coming. God </div>
<div id="tp_130" class="t s1_130">is at the tip of your tongue. </div>
<div id="tq_130" class="t s1_130">In a small school the chemistry teacher wrote a formula on the blackboard, and he asked </div>
<div id="tr_130" class="t s1_130">a small boy to stand up and tell him what this formula represents. The boy looked, and he </div>
<div id="ts_130" class="t s1_130">said, "Sir, it is just on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot remember." </div>
<div id="tt_130" class="t s1_130">The teacher said, "Spit it out! Spit it out! It is potassium cyanide!" </div>
<div id="tu_130" class="t s1_130">God is also on the tip of the tongue, and I will tell you, "Swallow it! Swallow it! Don't </div>
<div id="tv_130" class="t s1_130">spit it out! It is God!" Let him circulate in your blood. Let him become part of your </div>
<div id="tw_130" class="t s1_130">innermost vibrations. Let him become a song inside your being, a dance. </div>
<div id="tx_130" class="t s1_130">The identification with the body is nothing but a habit. A child is born, he does not know </div>
<div id="ty_130" class="t s1_130">who he is, and the parents have to create some identity; otherwise he will be lost in the </div>
<div id="tz_130" class="t s1_130">world. They have to tell him who he is. They also don't know. They have to create a false </div>
<div id="t10_130" class="t s1_130">label. They give him a name, they give him a mirror, and they tell him, "Look. This is </div>
<div id="t11_130" class="t s1_130">your face. Look. This is your name. Look. This is your home. Look. This is your caste, </div>
<div id="t12_130" class="t s1_130">your religion, your country." These identifications help him to feel who he is -- without </div>
<div id="t13_130" class="t s1_130">knowing who he is. These are habits. </div>
<div id="t14_130" class="t s1_130">Then by and by his mind starts developing. If he is born in a Hindu home, he reads the </div>
<div id="t15_130" class="t s1_130">Geeta, listens to the Geeta. If in a Christian home, he is brought to the church. A new </div>
<div id="t16_130" class="t s1_130">identity starts, an innermost identity -- he becomes a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan. </div>
<div id="t17_130" class="t s1_130">He is born in India, he becomes an Indian. In China, he becomes Chinese. And he starts </div>
<div id="t18_130" class="t s1_130">identifying himself with the tradition of the country. A Chinese identifies himself with </div>
