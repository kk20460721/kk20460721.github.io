<div id="t1_129" class="t s1_129">I have heard a story: An incompetent carpenter once built a creaky house for </div>
<div id="t2_129" class="t s1_129">himself, and maintained it carelessly. The roof threatened to collapse, the floors </div>
<div id="t3_129" class="t s1_129">were rough to walk upon. His neighbors warned him of the dangers and the </div>
<div id="t4_129" class="t s1_129">unattractiveness of his house, but he angrily refused to listen because it was not </div>
<div id="t5_129" class="t s1_129">only a house, it was also his ego-trip. It was his house, and he had made it. </div>
<div id="t6_129" class="t s1_129">Whenever anybody said anything against the house, he took it as if that man was </div>
<div id="t7_129" class="t s1_129">against him. </div>
<div id="t8_129" class="t s1_129">This is how mind reacts. </div>
<div id="t9_129" class="t s1_129">Finally getting tired of unwanted advice, he placed plugs in his ears. The </div>
<div id="ta_129" class="t s1_129">warnings continued, but now the carpenter only smiled, not hearing a word. </div>
<div id="tb_129" class="t s1_129">Inevitably, one day his house collapsed. Fortunately the man escaped with only </div>
<div id="tc_129" class="t s1_129">minor injuries. His neighbors scolded. They said,'See? We warned you. You are </div>
<div id="td_129" class="t s1_129">punished by your own stubbornness.' The carpenter just smiled pleasantly; he </div>
<div id="te_129" class="t s1_129">still wore his ear-plugs. Incredibly, in spite of the disaster, the carpenter went </div>
<div id="tf_129" class="t s1_129">right back to the same foolishness. </div>
<div id="tg_129" class="t s1_129">Ego is very stubborn. Even if you feel that you have committed a mistake, you </div>
<div id="th_129" class="t s1_129">don't realize it. You try to rationalize in a thousand and one ways, to defend, to </div>
<div id="ti_129" class="t s1_129">prove that it is not a mistake. And you again do it, hoping that this time </div>
<div id="tj_129" class="t s1_129">everything is going to be okay. This is hoping against hope. </div>
<div id="tk_129" class="t s1_129">Incredibly, in spite of the disaster, the carpenter went right back to the same </div>

<div id="tm_129" class="t s1_129">warned, but never changed his perilous way. That was because he had, by this </div>
<div id="tn_129" class="t s1_129">time, taken his ear-plugs as both a normal and an easy way of life. </div>
<div id="to_129" class="t s1_129">This explains the tragic life of men and women who insist on wearing </div>
<div id="tp_129" class="t s1_129">psychological ear-plugs. And remember, not only are Jews obsessed with </div>
<div id="tq_129" class="t s1_129">psychological ear-plugs, everybody on this earth is. Whenever your ego is in </div>

<div id="tt_129" class="t s1_129">search of truth has to understand these tricks, because these tricks are the traps. </div>
<div id="tu_129" class="t s1_129">These tricks are the ways in which you will miss the path. The path is very </div>
<div id="tv_129" class="t s1_129">straight and clear, but your mind is very cunning and it goes on creating new, </div>
<div id="tw_129" class="t s1_129">illusory paths; and you go on listening to it. And you have listened to it always </div>
<div id="tx_129" class="t s1_129">and always, and always it has proved to be in the wrong But it is your mind. You </div>
<div id="ty_129" class="t s1_129">think it is you; it is your ego. Just see the point of it. </div>
<div id="tz_129" class="t s1_129">Jesus' message was very simple in a way, straight. Anybody could have </div>
<div id="t10_129" class="t s1_129">understood it, but nobody understood it. And people became so enraged that </div>
<div id="t11_129" class="t s1_129">they killed this simple and innocent man. He had not committed any sin. He was </div>
<div id="t12_129" class="t s1_129">not a criminal, but he was treated as a criminal; not only like a criminal, he was </div>
<div id="t13_129" class="t s1_129">treated, worse than that. This is the point of today's sutras. </div>
<div id="t14_129" class="t s1_129">Three persons were going to be killed on that day: two thieves and Jesus. One of </div>
<div id="t15_129" class="t s1_129">the thieves' name was Barabbas. Pontius Pilate was hoping -- because that was </div>
