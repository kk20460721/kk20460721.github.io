<div id="t1_24" class="t s1_24">CHAPTER 2. TRADING DIALOGUE FOR LODGING</div>
<div id="t2_24" class="t s2_24">it.” How can you know it from the outside? You may go about and about, around and around, but</div>
<div id="t3_24" class="t s2_24">you will never hit the target. So neither experiment, nor thinking, but experience; simple, trusting –</div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s2_24">a man of faith.</div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s2_24">They searched and they found these three men, and then they were called to the capital for the ﬁnal</div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s2_24">judgment. The king said, ”For three days you rest and get ready. On the morning of the fourth day</div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s2_24">will be the examination, the ﬁnal. One of you will be chosen and he will become my prime minister</div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s2_24">– the one who is proved to be the most wise.”</div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s2_24">They started working in their own ways. Three days were not enough! The scientist had to think of</div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s2_24">many experiments, and work it out – who knows what type of examination there is going to be? So</div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s2_24">he couldn’t sleep for three days, there was no time: and there was his whole life to sleep once he</div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s2_24">was chosen, so why bother about sleep? He would not sleep, he would not eat – there was not time</div>
<div id="td_24" class="t s2_24">enough, and many things were to be done before the examination.</div>
<div id="te_24" class="t s2_24">The philosopher started thinking, many problems were to be solved: ”Who knows what type of</div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s2_24">problem is going to be asked?” Only the religious man was at ease. He ate, and ate well. Only</div>
<div id="tg_24" class="t s2_24">a religious man can eat well, because eating is an offering, it is something sacred. He slept well.</div>
<div id="th_24" class="t s2_24">He would pray, sit outside, go for a walk, look at the trees, and be thankful to God; because for a</div>
<div id="ti_24" class="t s2_24">religious man there is no future and there is no ﬁnal examination. Every moment is the examination,</div>
<div id="tj_24" class="t s2_24">so how can you prepare for it? If something is in the future you can prepare; but if something is right</div>
<div id="tk_24" class="t s2_24">now, here, how can you prepare for it? You have to face it. And there was no future.</div>
<div id="tl_24" class="t s2_24">Sometimes the scientist said, ”What are you doing? Wasting time – eating, sleeping, prayer. You</div>
<div id="tm_24" class="t s2_24">can do your prayers later on.” But he would laugh and he would not argue, he was not a man of</div>
<div id="tn_24" class="t s2_24">argument.</div>
<div id="to_24" class="t s2_24">The philosopher would say, ”You go on sleeping, you go on sitting outside in the garden, you go on</div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s2_24">looking at the trees. This is not going to help. Examination is not a child’s play, you have to be ready</div>
<div id="tq_24" class="t s2_24">for it.” But he would laugh. He believed more in laughter than in logic.</div>
<div id="tr_24" class="t s2_24">And on the morning of the fourth day, when they started for the palace for the ﬁnal examination, the</div>
<div id="ts_24" class="t s2_24">scientist was not even in a position to walk. He was so tired with his experiments, as if his whole life</div>
<div id="tt_24" class="t s2_24">had oozed out. He was dead tired, as if any moment he would fall and go to sleep. His eyes were</div>
<div id="tu_24" class="t s2_24">sleepy and his mind was troubled. He was almost crazy.</div>
<div id="tv_24" class="t s2_24">And the philosopher? He was not so tired, but he was more uncertain than ever, because he had</div>
<div id="tw_24" class="t s2_24">thought and thought and argued and argued, and no argument can become the conclusion.</div>
<div id="tx_24" class="t s2_24">He</div>
<div id="ty_24" class="t s2_24">was muddled, in a mess, he was a chaos. The day he had arrived he could have answered many</div>
<div id="tz_24" class="t s2_24">things, but now, no. Even his certain answers had become uncertain. The more you think, the more</div>
<div id="t10_24" class="t s2_24">philosophy becomes useless. Only fools can believe in certainties. The more you think, the more</div>
<div id="t11_24" class="t s2_24">intelligence comes to you, you can see these are all just words, there is no substance. Many times</div>
<div id="t12_24" class="t s2_24">he wanted to go back because this was not going to be of any use. He was not in the right shape.</div>
<div id="t13_24" class="t s2_24">But the scientist said, ”Come on! Let us try. What are we going to lose? If we win, it is okay. If we</div>
<div id="t14_24" class="t s2_24">don’t win, it is okay. But let us try. Don’t be so discouraged.”</div>
<div id="t15_24" class="t s2_24">Only the religious man was walking happily, singing. He could hear the birds in the trees, he could</div>
<div id="t16_24" class="t s2_24">see the sun rising, he could see the sunrays on the dewdrops. The whole life was such a miracle.</div>
<div id="t17_24" class="t s2_24">No Water, No Moon</div>
<div id="t18_24" class="t s2_24">24</div>
