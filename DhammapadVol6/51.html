<div id="t1_51" class="t s1_51">they are utterly blissful. But those who are caught in the wheel are crushed by so many </div>
<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">desires. </div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">The first truth is: life is sorrow. The second truth: the cause of sorrow is desire, desire </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">for more. And the third truth is the eightfold way. Buddha says that his whole approach </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">of transforming your being can be divided into eight steps; that is called the eightfold </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">way. And all those steps are nothing but different dimensions of a single phenomenon: </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">right mindfulness, SAMMASATI. Whatsoever you are doing, do it absolutely </div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">consciously, alertly, do it with awareness. Those eight steps are nothing but </div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s1_51">applications of awareness into different aspects of life. </div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">For example: if you are eating, Buddha says, eat with full awareness -- SAMYAK </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">AHAR. Then whatsoever you eat is right -- just be aware. Now see the difference: other </div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">religions say, "Eat this, eat that. Don't eat this, don't eat that." Buddha never says what </div>
<div id="td_51" class="t s1_51">to eat, what not to eat. He says, "Whatsoever you are eating, eat with full awareness. </div>
<div id="te_51" class="t s1_51">And if your awareness says no, then don't eat it." Can you eat meat with awareness? It </div>
<div id="tf_51" class="t s1_51">is impossible; you can eat meat only with unawareness. </div>
<div id="tg_51" class="t s1_51">In Africa a few days ago, one African dictator, Bokasso, who was trying to be another </div>
<div id="th_51" class="t s1_51">Napoleon, had been dethroned. The most strange thing that came to light was that in </div>
<div id="ti_51" class="t s1_51">his house, in his freezer, human flesh was found. He was a man-eater. </div>
<div id="tj_51" class="t s1_51">Just think of a man eating another man's meat. Is it possible in consciousness? The </div>
<div id="tk_51" class="t s1_51">whole thing is so disgusting! It is said that children were stolen just to prepare food for </div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s1_51">Bokasso. Of course, small children have delicious meat. Hundreds of children had </div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">disappeared and nobody could have ever thought that this man, who used to call </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">himself emperor, was the cause behind the whole thing. </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">But so is the case when you eat animal meat, not much difference in it. The animals also </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">have life just as you have. They are our brothers and our sisters. </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">Buddha never says what to eat, what not to eat; he never goes into details. And that's </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">my approach too: just be aware. </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">And likewise he uses this method of awareness for other things in life: SAMYAK </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">VYAYAM -- right effort. Don't make too much effort and don't make too little either. </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">Right effort for everything, a balanced effort, effort which does not disturb your </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">tranquility. Life is like walking on a tightrope: right effort is needed and awareness so </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">that you cannot fall. Each moment there is danger: if you lean too much towards the left </div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s1_51">you will fall. Finding yourself leaning too much to the left you have to lean towards the </div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s1_51">right to keep balance. And when you lean towards the right a moment comes, you start </div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s1_51">feeling that now you will fall towards the right; then you start leaning towards the left </div>
<div id="t10_51" class="t s1_51">just to balance. This is right effort: keeping balanced. </div>
<div id="t11_51" class="t s1_51">All those eight steps are nothing but applications of a single thing -- awareness. Buddha </div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s1_51">calls it right mindfulness. Don't do anything unconsciously. </div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s1_51">And the fourth: AND THE END OF SORROW -- nirvana, cessation of sorrow. The man </div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s1_51">who follows the path finds four things: life is sorrow, the cause of sorrow is desire, the </div>
<div id="t15_51" class="t s1_51">method to get rid of sorrow is the eightfold path, rooted basically, essentially, in the </div>
<div id="t16_51" class="t s1_51">phenomenon of awareness. And the fourth: that if you follow awareness you will attain </div>
