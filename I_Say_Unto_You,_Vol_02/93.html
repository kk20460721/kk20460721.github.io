<div id="t1_93" class="t s1_93">CHAPTER 5. ECSTASY IS POLARITIES MEETING</div>
<div id="t2_93" class="t s2_93">Hence Jesus was always ready to go to people, to drink with them, to eat with them, because that</div>
<div id="t3_93" class="t s2_93">is the most relaxing moment in people’s lives. Buddha has never done that – that was not his way.</div>
<div id="t4_93" class="t s2_93">When people are eating, they are relaxed.</div>
<div id="t5_93" class="t s2_93">Have you not watched it? Even businessmen like to take you for lunch, because then things are</div>
<div id="t6_93" class="t s2_93">easier. You are more positive, you are more relaxed, you say yes more easily. So if the salesman</div>
<div id="t7_93" class="t s2_93">wants to sell the car to you, he takes you for lunch. When your belly is feeling good and you are</div>
<div id="t8_93" class="t s2_93">feeling very contented, and the aroma of the food and the joy of the food, and you are feeling really</div>
<div id="t9_93" class="t s2_93">satisﬁed... it is very difﬁcult to say no. It is easier for the salesman to sell something to you. And</div>
<div id="ta_93" class="t s2_93">Jesus is the greatest salesman. It is not just accidental that his religion has become the greatest</div>
<div id="tb_93" class="t s2_93">religion as far as numbers are concerned. The greatest salesman ever.</div>
<div id="tc_93" class="t s2_93">He would go to people to take food with them or to drink with them, and that was the moment when</div>
<div id="td_93" class="t s2_93">he would try to inﬁltrate their being with his presence. That was his catalytic, magnetic power. When</div>
<div id="te_93" class="t s2_93">people are drinking... You have drunk a little bit – you become more relaxed. Then things are more</div>
<div id="tf_93" class="t s2_93">easy, you are less defensive.</div>
<div id="tg_93" class="t s2_93">Gurdjieff used to do that – that was his everyday work. Just as every day I go on talking to you, every</div>
<div id="th_93" class="t s2_93">day he used to invite his disciples for food. That was the greatest thing. Every day, every night. And</div>
<div id="ti_93" class="t s2_93">it was not an ordinary dinner. It used to continue for ﬁve hours, six hours, seven hours, almost half</div>
<div id="tj_93" class="t s2_93">the night. And then drinking... and he would force you to eat and drink, and he himself would be</div>
<div id="tk_93" class="t s2_93">serving and it would be difﬁcult to say no; eating, drinking, laughing, you would be less defensive.</div>
<div id="tl_93" class="t s2_93">And he would be telling jokes, and people would become very very relaxed. The atmosphere would</div>
<div id="tm_93" class="t s2_93">become very homely – utterly homely. They would forget who Gurdjieff was and who they were.</div>
<div id="tn_93" class="t s2_93">They would relax into his being, and his work would start.</div>
<div id="to_93" class="t s2_93">That’s exactly what I am doing I go on talking to you. That is a kind of feast, a feast of words. You</div>
<div id="tp_93" class="t s2_93">become involved in the words, you become utterly involved with the.words, and my work, the REAL</div>
<div id="tq_93" class="t s2_93">work starts. That is indirect.</div>
<div id="tr_93" class="t s2_93">So the ﬁrst thing, the ﬁrst word to be understood about Christ is ’catalytic’.</div>
<div id="ts_93" class="t s2_93">He is not a great</div>
<div id="tt_93" class="t s2_93">philosopher like Buddha. He is not a great scientist like Patanjali. He is not a singer like Krishna is.</div>
<div id="tu_93" class="t s2_93">But he has his own method and that method is of the catalytic agent.</div>
<div id="tv_93" class="t s2_93">In the East there have been many Masters like that, but Jesus is the ultimate in SATSANGA: just</div>
<div id="tw_93" class="t s2_93">being with people.</div>
<div id="tx_93" class="t s2_93">The catalytic agent means that nothing is done to you, but something happens to you. The catalytic</div>
<div id="ty_93" class="t s2_93">agent does not go into you, and does not do anything in you. But just the presence, just the very</div>
<div id="tz_93" class="t s2_93">presence provokes you, inspires you, and something starts growing in you. Just as scientists say, if</div>
<div id="t10_93" class="t s2_93">you want to make water, hydrogen and oxygen are needed; but they cannot meet unless electricity is</div>
<div id="t11_93" class="t s2_93">present as a catalytic agent. It does not enter into them, it remains aloof, but its very presence helps</div>
<div id="t12_93" class="t s2_93">them to meet. That is very miraculous. Science has not yet been able to know how the catalytic</div>
<div id="t13_93" class="t s2_93">agent works, because nothing goes out of it, it is simply there. But you can understand it.</div>
<div id="t14_93" class="t s2_93">Sometimes I am simply here, and something becomes silent in you. And this can happen even when</div>
<div id="t15_93" class="t s2_93">you are far away if you remember me. If you remember totally, immediately you will ﬁnd something</div>
<div id="t16_93" class="t s2_93">I Say Unto You, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t17_93" class="t s2_93">93</div>
<div id="t18_93" class="t s3_93">Osho</div>
