<div id="t2_58" class="t s1_58">still have to live. They have to give some proof that they are against this man. </div>
<div id="t3_58" class="t s1_58">They denied Jesus while he was dying. They threw mud, stones, they spat on his face, </div>
<div id="t4_58" class="t s1_58">just to show the crowds, "See, isn't this enough proof that the rumors that you have </div>
<div id="t5_58" class="t s1_58">heard that we are sympathizers are absolutely wrong, unfounded? We are against him </div>
<div id="t6_58" class="t s1_58">as much as you are -- in fact, we are more against him than you are." </div>
<div id="t7_58" class="t s1_58">The enemies were not spitting on him but the friends. Jesus became a world force not </div>
<div id="t8_58" class="t s1_58">because of himself but only when the Roman emperors and Christian priests joined </div>
<div id="t9_58" class="t s1_58">hands. Now, this is an irony. Jesus was crucified by a Roman emperor -- see how </div>
<div id="ta_58" class="t s1_58">history moves! Pontius Pilate was just a representative of the Roman power, of the </div>
<div id="tb_58" class="t s1_58">Roman emperor; he simply followed the orders from Rome. Who would ever have </div>
<div id="tc_58" class="t s1_58">thought that Rome would become the central place of Christianity? Who would ever </div>
<div id="td_58" class="t s1_58">have thought while Jesus was being crucified that Rome would be the residence of the </div>
<div id="te_58" class="t s1_58">pope? But that's how it happened. When priests joined hands with Emperor </div>
<div id="tf_58" class="t s1_58">Constantine and other Roman emperors, Christianity became a world force. </div>
<div id="tg_58" class="t s1_58">Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism -- they have all depended on politics. They </div>
<div id="th_58" class="t s1_58">are not true religions anymore but political games being played in the name of religion. </div>
<div id="ti_58" class="t s1_58">I would like the world to have many more religions, so many that each individual has </div>
<div id="tj_58" class="t s1_58">his own religion -- then no priest will be needed. That is the only way to drop the </div>
<div id="tk_58" class="t s1_58">priests. If you have your own religion, no priest is needed -- you are the priest and you </div>
<div id="tl_58" class="t s1_58">are the follower and you are everything. </div>
<div id="tm_58" class="t s1_58">You have to listen to your inner voice. Buddha says: Follow your own nature; there is </div>
<div id="tn_58" class="t s1_58">no need for anybody to intercede on your behalf. </div>
<div id="to_58" class="t s1_58">But I am not in favor of creating one religion; enough of that nonsense! In the past we </div>
<div id="tp_58" class="t s1_58">have been trying to do that: make one religion so that quarreling can stop. But it is not </div>
<div id="tq_58" class="t s1_58">possible. Even if you can enforce one religion, if the whole world becomes Christian, </div>
<div id="tr_58" class="t s1_58">then again there will be Protestants and Catholics and a thousand and one sects. And </div>
<div id="ts_58" class="t s1_58">the same game will start again: people will start quarreling -- because their needs are </div>
<div id="tt_58" class="t s1_58">different, their understandings are different. </div>
<div id="tu_58" class="t s1_58">I have heard: </div>
<div id="tv_58" class="t s1_58">A beautiful young woman came home from London. She belonged to a small village, </div>
<div id="tw_58" class="t s1_58">was from a Catholic family. After three or four years of living in London she had </div>
<div id="tx_58" class="t s1_58">become very rich; she came back to see her parents. The mother could not believe her </div>
<div id="ty_58" class="t s1_58">eyes. She asked, "How did you manage? You have become so rich -- such beautiful </div>
<div id="tz_58" class="t s1_58">clothes, a diamond ring, a beautiful car!" </div>
<div id="t10_58" class="t s1_58">And the girl said, "Mother, I have become a prostitute." </div>
<div id="t11_58" class="t s1_58">Just hearing this the mother fainted, became unconscious. When she came back she </div>
<div id="t12_58" class="t s1_58">asked again, "What did you say?" </div>
<div id="t13_58" class="t s1_58">The girl said, "Mother, I said I have become a prostitute." </div>
<div id="t14_58" class="t s1_58">And the mother started laughing and she said, "I misunderstood you -- I thought you </div>
<div id="t15_58" class="t s1_58">said you had become a Protestant." </div>
