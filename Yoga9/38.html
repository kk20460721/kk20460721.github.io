<div id="t1_38" class="t s1_38">both will die. You see the point?" He said, "Money is needed." The man who believed in </div>
<div id="t2_38" class="t s1_38">renunciation laughed, but he didn't say anything. Then the hoarder paid and they crossed </div>
<div id="t3_38" class="t s1_38">the river; they reached the other shore. The hoarder again said, "Now remember, next </div>
<div id="t4_38" class="t s1_38">time don't start arguing with me. You see? Money helps. Without money we would have </div>
<div id="t5_38" class="t s1_38">been dead. The whole night on the other shore, it was dangerous to survive -- wild </div>
<div id="t6_38" class="t s1_38">animals." </div>
<div id="t7_38" class="t s1_38">The other bhikkhu laughed and he said, "But we have come across the river because you </div>
<div id="t8_38" class="t s1_38">could renounce it. It is not because of hoarding that we have survived. If you had insisted </div>
<div id="t9_38" class="t s1_38">on hoarding it and you were not going to pay the ferryman, we would have died. It is </div>
<div id="ta_38" class="t s1_38">because you could renounce -- because you could leave it, you could give it -- that's why </div>
<div id="tb_38" class="t s1_38">we have survived." </div>
<div id="tc_38" class="t s1_38">The argument must be continuing still. But remember, I am not against money. I am all </div>
<div id="td_38" class="t s1_38">for it, but use it. Possess it, own it; but your ownership arises only the moment you have </div>
<div id="te_38" class="t s1_38">become capable of giving it. At the throat center this new synthesis happens. You can </div>
<div id="tf_38" class="t s1_38">accept and you can give. </div>
<div id="tg_38" class="t s1_38">There are people who change from one extreme to another. First they were incapable of </div>
<div id="th_38" class="t s1_38">giving, they could only receive; then they change, they go to the other extreme -- now </div>
<div id="ti_38" class="t s1_38">they can give but they cannot receive. That too is lopsidedness. A real man is capable of </div>
<div id="tj_38" class="t s1_38">accepting gifts and giving them. In India you will find many sannyasins, many so-called </div>
<div id="tk_38" class="t s1_38">mahatmas, who will not touch money. If you give them any, they will shrink back, as if </div>
<div id="tl_38" class="t s1_38">you have produced a snake or something poisonous. Their shrinking back shows that now </div>
<div id="tm_38" class="t s1_38">they have moved to the other extreme: now they have become incapable of receiving. </div>
<div id="tn_38" class="t s1_38">Again their throat center is half-functioning -- and a center never functions really unless it </div>
<div id="to_38" class="t s1_38">functions fully, unless the wheel moves the full way, goes on moving and creates energy </div>
<div id="tp_38" class="t s1_38">fields. </div>
<div id="tq_38" class="t s1_38">Then is the third-eye center. At the third-eye center the right and left meet, pingala and </div>
<div id="tr_38" class="t s1_38">ida meet, and become sushumna. The two hemispheres of the brain meet at the third eye; </div>
<div id="ts_38" class="t s1_38">that is just between the two eyes. One eye represents the right, another eye represents the </div>
<div id="tt_38" class="t s1_38">left, and it is just in the middle. These left and right brains meeting at the third eye, this is </div>
<div id="tu_38" class="t s1_38">a very high synthesis. People have been capable of describing up to this point. That's why </div>
<div id="tv_38" class="t s1_38">Ramkrishna could describe up to the third eye. And when he started to talk about the </div>
<div id="tw_38" class="t s1_38">final, the ultimate synthesis that happens at sahasrar, he again and again fell into silence, </div>
<div id="tx_38" class="t s1_38">into samadhi. He was drowned in it; it was too much. It was floodlike; he was taken over </div>
<div id="ty_38" class="t s1_38">to the ocean. He could not keep himself conscious, alert. </div>
<div id="tz_38" class="t s1_38">The ultimate synthesis happens at sahasrar, the crown chakra. Because of this sahasrar, </div>
<div id="t10_38" class="t s1_38">all over the world kings, emperors, monarchs, and queens, use the crown. It has become </div>
<div id="t11_38" class="t s1_38">formal, but basically it was accepted because unless your sahasrar is functioning, how </div>
<div id="t12_38" class="t s1_38">can you be a monarch, how can you be a king? How can you rule people, you have not </div>
<div id="t13_38" class="t s1_38">even become a ruler of yourself? In the symbol of the crown is hidden a secret. The secret </div>
<div id="t14_38" class="t s1_38">is that a person who has reached to the crown center, the ultimate synthesis of his being, </div>
<div id="t15_38" class="t s1_38">only he should be the king or the queen, nobody else. Only he is capable of ruling others, </div>
<div id="t16_38" class="t s1_38">because he has come to rule himself. He has become a master of himself; now he can be </div>
<div id="t17_38" class="t s1_38">helpful to others also. </div>
<div id="t18_38" class="t s1_38">Really, when you achieve to sahasrar, A crown flowers within you, a one-thousand-</div>
<div id="t19_38" class="t s1_38">petaled lotus opens. No crown can be compared with it, but then it became just A symbol. </div>
<div id="t1a_38" class="t s1_38">And the symbol has existed all over the world. That simply shows that everywhere </div>
