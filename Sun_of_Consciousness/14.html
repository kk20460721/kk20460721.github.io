<div id="t1_14" class="t s1_14">CHAPTER 2. THE UNIVERSE – A FAMILY</div>
<div id="t2_14" class="t s2_14">too may not be defeated.” Lao Tzu said, ”You are bound to be defeated because one who does not</div>
<div id="t3_14" class="t s2_14">want to be defeated, has already invited defeat. This is my sutra that no one could ever defeat me,</div>
<div id="t4_14" class="t s2_14">because I never wanted to win. One who wants to win, he will be defeated.”</div>
<div id="t5_14" class="t s2_14">Lao Tzu was passing through a forest, along with his disciples. The whole forest was being cut.</div>
<div id="t6_14" class="t s2_14">Thousands of carpenters were cutting the trees but there was one tree that was standing. No one</div>
<div id="t7_14" class="t s2_14">touched it. Lao Tzu said, ”Go and ask that tree what is the secret of its being safe. Does it somehow</div>
<div id="t8_14" class="t s2_14">know the sutra of Yoga? Does it know Tao? When the whole forest is being cut, then why is only</div>
<div id="t9_14" class="t s2_14">this tree not cut?” Since Lao Tzu had told them to, the disciples went, but they were in a ﬁx as to</div>
<div id="ta_14" class="t s2_14">what to ask of a tree? They walked around the tree but how to ask the tree? It was true, not a</div>
<div id="tb_14" class="t s2_14">single leaf was picked, not a single branch was cut. Its branches were spread to such a distance</div>
<div id="tc_14" class="t s2_14">that one thousand bullock carts could halt beneath it. The shadow was too thick. Then they thought,</div>
<div id="td_14" class="t s2_14">why not ask these carpenters who are cutting so many trees. They asked the carpenters, ”What is</div>
<div id="te_14" class="t s2_14">the secret of this tree’s being safe? Why are you not cutting it?” The carpenters told them that that</div>
<div id="tf_14" class="t s2_14">tree was strange. Its wood was so cross-wise that it could not be made into furniture. The disciples</div>
<div id="tg_14" class="t s2_14">of Lao Tzu said – ”At least this tree can be used as ﬁre-wood?” The carpenters said, ”This tree is</div>
<div id="th_14" class="t s2_14">so strange, it emits so much smoke that it cannot be made into ﬁre-wood.” They said, ”This tree is</div>
<div id="ti_14" class="t s2_14">useless. To cut it is a waste of energy.” The disciples returned and told Lao Tzu, ”The secret is that</div>
<div id="tj_14" class="t s2_14">the tree is useless. The wood is not straight and also it emits much smoke. Even the leaves are not</div>
<div id="tk_14" class="t s2_14">useful as any medicine. Even animals do not eat these leaves. This tree is absolutely useless.” Lao</div>
<div id="tl_14" class="t s2_14">Tzu told them, ”Blessed is this tree. Its branches did not try to become straight and hence they are</div>
<div id="tm_14" class="t s2_14">saved from being cut. The trees that are making efforts to become straight... can you see? They</div>
<div id="tn_14" class="t s2_14">are being cut. The leaves of this tree have not tried to become something, did not try to become</div>
<div id="to_14" class="t s2_14">tasteful, and hence they are, and are in total bliss. Lao Tzu said, ”This is my method too. No one</div>
<div id="tp_14" class="t s2_14">could ever defeat me because I did not want to win. For ever and ever I am defeated and hence it is</div>
<div id="tq_14" class="t s2_14">difﬁcult to defeat me.</div>
<div id="tr_14" class="t s2_14">Once Lao Tzu said, ”One man, hearing that Lao Tzu could not be defeated by anyone, challenged</div>
<div id="ts_14" class="t s2_14">me in a village.” Lao Tzu was staying in the village. He must have said to someone that he could</div>
<div id="tt_14" class="t s2_14">never be defeated by anyone. The news spread in the village. Some wrestler considered it to be a</div>
<div id="tu_14" class="t s2_14">challenge! He came in front of Lao Tzu’s door and challenged him saying, ”I will defeat you.” Lao</div>
<div id="tv_14" class="t s2_14">Tzu said, ”You cannot defeat me”. The wrestler said, ”I will defeat you now.” A crowd gathered there.</div>
<div id="tw_14" class="t s2_14">The wrestler put on his wrestling gear, remembered his deity and he came to ﬁght. But Lao Tzu fell</div>
<div id="tx_14" class="t s2_14">ﬂat in front of him and said to him, ”Come, sit on me.” The wrestler said, ”What kind of man are you?</div>
<div id="ty_14" class="t s2_14">The interest in defeating you is gone.” Lao Tzu said, ”I had already said that no one could defeat</div>
<div id="tz_14" class="t s2_14">me up till now because I have already accepted the defeat. I don’t want to win. Come and sit on</div>
<div id="t10_14" class="t s2_14">my chest and make it public by beating a drum that you have defeated me. The wrestler said, ”It is</div>
<div id="t11_14" class="t s2_14">useless to sit on such a man.” The wrestler touched the feet of Lao Tzu and left for his home. He</div>
<div id="t12_14" class="t s2_14">said ﬁghting was useless.</div>
<div id="t13_14" class="t s2_14">Yoga says, it is futile to choose between the dualities.</div>
<div id="t14_14" class="t s2_14">Yoga says do not make a choice between what is always seen as two in life. They are one and the</div>
<div id="t15_14" class="t s2_14">same. It is only a deception. Face value is one thing, at the back something else. Existence and</div>
<div id="t16_14" class="t s2_14">nonexistence, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and bad, moral and immoral, monk and</div>
<div id="t17_14" class="t s2_14">thief, religion and irreligion, are all the expansion of only one thing. Understand them but do not</div>
<div id="t18_14" class="t s2_14">choose.</div>
<div id="t19_14" class="t s2_14">Sun of Consciousness</div>
