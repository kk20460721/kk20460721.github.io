<div id="t1_101" class="t s1_101">CHAPTER 6.</div>
<div id="t2_101" class="t s2_101">urgent work during the middle of the period, and she went away. I kept on sleeping and the professor</div>
<div id="t3_101" class="t s2_101">went on lecturing. When the period was over and he opened his eyes, he found me sleeping. He</div>
<div id="t4_101" class="t s2_101">woke me up and asked why I was sleeping. I said to him, ”Now that you have found me sleeping, I</div>
<div id="t5_101" class="t s2_101">would like to tell you that I have been sleeping daily, that I have no quarrel with young women and</div>
<div id="t6_101" class="t s2_101">that it is very pleasurable to sleep while you are lecturing.”</div>
<div id="t7_101" class="t s2_101">Sleeping was more or less a sort of meditation for me. I slept as long as I could. It is interesting to</div>
<div id="t8_101" class="t s2_101">note that if you sleep in excess of your requirements, you remain awake and aware even during</div>
<div id="t9_101" class="t s2_101">sleep.</div>
<div id="ta_101" class="t s2_101">If you sleep less than your requirements, then during sleep you become unconscious.</div>
<div id="tb_101" class="t s2_101">You cannot sleep more than your requirements.</div>
<div id="tc_101" class="t s2_101">If you still persist in sleeping after the body’s</div>
<div id="td_101" class="t s2_101">requirements for rest are over, someone inside you remains aware and becomes a witness of all</div>
<div id="te_101" class="t s2_101">that is happening around you.</div>
<div id="tf_101" class="t s2_101">If you remain lying down for thirty-six hours at a stretch, you will</div>
<div id="tg_101" class="t s2_101">have an inkling of what Krishna means when he says that at night the sage remains awake. If you</div>
<div id="th_101" class="t s2_101">continue to keep the body in a condition of sleep even after it does not need any sleep, then within</div>
<div id="ti_101" class="t s2_101">you a sort of wakeful sound begins to become audible.</div>
<div id="tj_101" class="t s2_101">In those days of continuous sleeping, I began to realize that it is possible to remain awake in sleep.</div>
<div id="tk_101" class="t s2_101">I slept during the night, morning and afternoon continually. Whenever there was a chance to sleep</div>
<div id="tl_101" class="t s2_101">I did not miss it. My family members and friends believed that I was totally lazy and that I would not</div>
<div id="tm_101" class="t s2_101">be able to do anything in life. In a way, from their point of view, they were right – but not so from my</div>
<div id="tn_101" class="t s2_101">side. I had made inactivity an experiment in meditation.</div>
<div id="to_101" class="t s2_101">There was another professor of mine. He was also a good friend, and he was as inactive as I was.</div>
<div id="tp_101" class="t s2_101">Since he was also living alone, as was I, he suggested that it would be better if we roomed together.</div>
<div id="tq_101" class="t s2_101">I told him that there might be some difﬁculty in this. Quite possibly, I thought, I might disturb his sleep</div>
<div id="tr_101" class="t s2_101">or he might disturb mine. However, if he still wished that we stay together, it would be necessary to</div>
<div id="ts_101" class="t s2_101">make some arrangements, since both of us were lazy. Even now he is like that. He has not given</div>
<div id="tt_101" class="t s2_101">up this particular quality of his. But he has never made this quality an experiment in meditation;</div>
<div id="tu_101" class="t s2_101">otherwise he would have been beyond it by now.</div>
<div id="tv_101" class="t s2_101">Bear in mind that within a few days you will be able to transcend anything which you make a part of</div>
<div id="tw_101" class="t s2_101">your meditation. Meditation means transcendence. Anything which you fully and totally enjoy you</div>
<div id="tx_101" class="t s2_101">will be able to transcend. If you experience inactivity fully, you will suddenly ﬁnd that the inactivity</div>
<div id="ty_101" class="t s2_101">has left you forever. So if there is anything from which you want to be freed, enjoy it fully. For this</div>
<div id="tz_101" class="t s2_101">reason I thought it best to totally enjoy my inactivity ﬁrst.</div>
<div id="t10_101" class="t s2_101">When my professor friend and I started staying together, on the very ﬁrst day I had to settle what</div>
<div id="t11_101" class="t s2_101">would be our arrangements. Until now we had been living apart, so there had been no need for any</div>
<div id="t12_101" class="t s2_101">particular arrangements. First of all he proposed that whosoever got up earlier should go and bring</div>
<div id="t13_101" class="t s2_101">milk. I immediately agreed. I was pleased and he was also pleased. But both of us were in illusion.</div>
<div id="t14_101" class="t s2_101">I had been thinking that there was no need for me to get up ﬁrst in the morning, but to my dismay</div>
<div id="t15_101" class="t s2_101">he was also thinking the same. About nine o’clock the next morning, I opened my eyes. When I saw</div>
<div id="t16_101" class="t s2_101">him sleeping, I slept again. He awoke by ten in the morning and saw me sleeping. He also wanted</div>
<div id="t17_101" class="t s2_101">to sleep, but there was one difﬁculty for him. He had to go to the university at eleven o’clock. After</div>
<div id="t18_101" class="t s2_101">all, he was in service, but I was only a student. Thus, I had neither any compulsion nor necessity to</div>
<div id="t19_101" class="t s2_101">go. As it was, I never did attend college regularly.</div>
<div id="t1a_101" class="t s2_101">Ultimately, out of sheer necessity, he had to get up and fetch the milk. By the time he came back I</div>
<div id="t1b_101" class="t s2_101">Dimensions Beyond the Known</div>
<div id="t1c_101" class="t s2_101">101</div>
