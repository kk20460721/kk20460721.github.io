<div id="t1_24" class="t s1_24">man, but even he was moved by these two men facing each other sitting in such a </div>
<div id="t2_24" class="t s1_24">tremendous silence. He could see Buddha's face and he could see the face of the man </div>
<div id="t3_24" class="t s1_24">becoming transformed just before his eyes. A grace descended, a great peace arose. </div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s1_24">And then after an hour or so the man opened his eyes, touched Buddha's feet in deep </div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s1_24">gratitude, thanked him and went away. </div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s1_24">Ananda asked Buddha, "It is incomprehensible to me: he asks about God and you talk </div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s1_24">about horses. But I know you, I have heard you doing this to many people -- but more </div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s1_24">than that I am puzzled about what transpired between the two of you. I know you, so it </div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s1_24">was not a great puzzle for me that you closed your eyes and you became silent. I know </div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s1_24">that it is more difficult for you to talk than to be in silence -- silence is natural to you, </div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s1_24">spontaneous to you -- but what happened to the other man? I could see that he was </div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s1_24">becoming silent and after a few minutes he was in such a deep silence -- as if he had </div>
<div id="td_24" class="t s1_24">lived with you for years. Even I have not known such silence! And then what happened </div>
<div id="te_24" class="t s1_24">in that silence? What communion happened? What communication happened? What </div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s1_24">transpired? For what was he grateful? Why did he thank you so much?" </div>
<div id="tg_24" class="t s1_24">Buddha said, "There are four kinds of horses -- you are the first kind, Ananda, and he is </div>
<div id="th_24" class="t s1_24">the fourth! Just the shadow of the whip is enough, he understood. And I was not talking </div>
<div id="ti_24" class="t s1_24">about horses, I was talking about God; but God cannot be talked about directly. And I </div>
<div id="tj_24" class="t s1_24">was not talking about horses, I was talking about meditation. But I knew the man -- he </div>
<div id="tk_24" class="t s1_24">is also a lover of horses. When I saw him coming on his horse I knew it immediately: he </div>
<div id="tl_24" class="t s1_24">had such a rare kind of horse, only a lover of horses could choose such a horse. That's </div>
<div id="tm_24" class="t s1_24">why I talked about horses -- that was the language he could understand, and he </div>
<div id="tn_24" class="t s1_24">understood it. And when I closed my eyes he saw the shadow of the whip. He closed </div>
<div id="to_24" class="t s1_24">his eyes -- he understood that the ultimate cannot be talked about, but you can be silent </div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s1_24">about it, utterly silent about it, and in silence it is known. It is a transcendental </div>
<div id="tq_24" class="t s1_24">experience: it is beyond mind and beyond heart, it is beyond yes and beyond no, it is </div>
<div id="tr_24" class="t s1_24">beyond negative, beyond positive." </div>
<div id="ts_24" class="t s1_24">But if you are going to choose between the negative and the positive, then I will say: </div>
<div id="tt_24" class="t s1_24">choose the positive -- because it is easier to slip out of the yes than to slip out of the no -- </div>
<div id="tu_24" class="t s1_24">because no does not have much space in it; it is a dark dark prison cell. Yes is wider; it is </div>
<div id="tv_24" class="t s1_24">more open, more vulnerable. To move from no you will find it very difficult: you don't </div>
<div id="tw_24" class="t s1_24">have much space, you are enclosed in it from every side, and all the doors and all the </div>
<div id="tx_24" class="t s1_24">windows are closed. No is a closed space. </div>
<div id="ty_24" class="t s1_24">To live in the negative is the most stupid thing a man can do, but millions are living in </div>
<div id="tz_24" class="t s1_24">the negative. Modern man particularly is living in the negative. He is repeating the </div>
<div id="t10_24" class="t s1_24">story of Turgenev, THE FOOL, because living in the negative he feels great, his ego feels </div>
<div id="t11_24" class="t s1_24">very satisfied. Ego is a prison cell created by the bricks of no's; negativity is its food. </div>
<div id="t12_24" class="t s1_24">So if you have to choose, Saguna, between the negative and the positive, choose the </div>
<div id="t13_24" class="t s1_24">positive. At least you will have a little wider scope; a few windows and doors will be </div>
<div id="t14_24" class="t s1_24">open, the wind and the sun and the rain will be available to you. You will have a few </div>
<div id="t15_24" class="t s1_24">glimpses of the open sky outside and the stars and the moon. And sometimes the </div>
