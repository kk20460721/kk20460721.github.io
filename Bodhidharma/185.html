<div id="t2_185" class="t s1_185">There are still people who can be called contemporaries of Gautam Buddha; they </div>
<div id="t3_185" class="t s1_185">are connected so deeply that you cannot separate them, by time or by space. </div>
<div id="t4_185" class="t s1_185">In Mohammedanism, only a small school of Sufis is a living part; the whole of </div>
<div id="t5_185" class="t s1_185">the rest of that religion has died. But Sufism is still continuing a chain reaction. </div>
<div id="t6_185" class="t s1_185">Still there are people who are awakened. </div>
<div id="t7_185" class="t s1_185">In Judaism, the whole religion except for a small school of the Hassids is dead. </div>
<div id="t8_185" class="t s1_185">Those Hassids have been carrying the torch for centuries. They are still creating </div>
<div id="t9_185" class="t s1_185">more and more enlightened people. </div>
<div id="ta_185" class="t s1_185">Strangely, Hinduism and Christianity are completely dead religions. They don't </div>
<div id="tb_185" class="t s1_185">have even a small stream of living masters. And they are very important </div>
<div id="tc_185" class="t s1_185">religions. Hinduism is the oldest religion of the world and Christianity is the </div>
<div id="td_185" class="t s1_185">biggest religion of the world, but both are completely dead. They are just an ugly </div>
<div id="te_185" class="t s1_185">weight on humanity. Nothing blossoms in their gardens; no flower comes to </div>
<div id="tf_185" class="t s1_185">release its fragrance. They are lamps without any flame in them. </div>
<div id="tg_185" class="t s1_185">It is said of Diogenes, a man of the same caliber as Bodhidharma </div>
<div id="th_185" class="t s1_185">....</div>
<div id="ti_185" class="t s1_185">If they had </div>
<div id="tj_185" class="t s1_185">met, it would have been a great meeting. Diogenes was in Greece. He lived </div>
<div id="tk_185" class="t s1_185">naked; he had such a beautiful body that to hide it behind clothes would have </div>
<div id="tl_185" class="t s1_185">been a crime. It is perfectly good to hide an ugly body behind clothes but a </div>
<div id="tm_185" class="t s1_185">beautiful body needs to be available for anybody who wants to see the beauty, </div>
<div id="tn_185" class="t s1_185">the proportion. Diogenes was one of the most beautiful men. Even when </div>
<div id="to_185" class="t s1_185">Alexander the Great met him, he felt a little embarrassed -- although he was a </div>
<div id="tp_185" class="t s1_185">world conqueror, compared to Diogenes he was utterly poor. </div>
<div id="tq_185" class="t s1_185">Diogenes had nothing, but his richness was radiating from his naked body. </div>
<div id="tr_185" class="t s1_185">Diogenes used to carry a lamp, even in the daytime. He was thought to be a little </div>
<div id="ts_185" class="t s1_185">crazy -- obviously. In a world of insane people, anybody who is sane is bound to </div>
<div id="tt_185" class="t s1_185">be thought a little crazy. And he was doing something which you will also feel </div>
<div id="tu_185" class="t s1_185">looks a little crazy. Whomever he would meet on the way, he would take up his </div>
<div id="tv_185" class="t s1_185">lamp and look at his face. And when asked, "What are you doing, Diogenes? It is </div>
<div id="tw_185" class="t s1_185">full daylight; you don't need to keep your lamp burning," he would say, "no, I </div>
<div id="tx_185" class="t s1_185">have to keep it burning. I am searching for an authentic man." </div>
<div id="ty_185" class="t s1_185">When he was dying, his lamp by his side, somebody asked, "Diogenes, your </div>
<div id="tz_185" class="t s1_185">whole life you have been searching for an authentic man. What happened? Did </div>
<div id="t10_185" class="t s1_185">you meet any authentic man or not?" He said, "Thank God, although I never met </div>
<div id="t11_185" class="t s1_185">any authentic man I have saved my lamp." </div>
<div id="t12_185" class="t s1_185">Because the world is so cunning, so full of thieves, even to save one's lamp is to </div>
<div id="t13_185" class="t s1_185">be fortunate. This Diogenes was an awakened man. In fact, he was not looking in </div>
<div id="t14_185" class="t s1_185">your eyes when he raised his lamp, he was showing his eyes, so that you could </div>
<div id="t15_185" class="t s1_185">see clearly into his eyes, and THERE was an authentic man. And if you had </div>
<div id="t16_185" class="t s1_185">looked into his eyes, you would have changed totally into a new being. </div>
<div id="t17_185" class="t s1_185">A disciple looks into the eyes of the master. He looks into the very depth of his </div>
