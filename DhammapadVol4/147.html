<div id="t1_147" class="t s1_147">This is the legal mind. This is how the legal mind functions: "I would have married the </div>
<div id="t2_147" class="t s1_147">bloody bird!" It goes from one foolishness to another foolishness. </div>
<div id="t3_147" class="t s1_147">If you starve your body of the right food, of the right amount of oxygen, problems will </div>
<div id="t4_147" class="t s1_147">arise. And you will go to the same people who are creating problems for you, and they </div>
<div id="t5_147" class="t s1_147">have ready-made prescriptions. </div>
<div id="t6_147" class="t s1_147">One man came to me, a young man; he was under the spell of Swami Shivananda of </div>
<div id="t7_147" class="t s1_147">Rishikesh. </div>
<div id="t8_147" class="t s1_147">Shivananda told him, "Live only on milk, because that is the purest food." </div>
<div id="t9_147" class="t s1_147">Now, if you have seen pictures of Shivananda... one can see that this man has not lived </div>
<div id="ta_147" class="t s1_147">only on milk. He was so fat that even to raise his own hands was difficult for him, they </div>
<div id="tb_147" class="t s1_147">were so heavy. So he had to walk with two people, his hands on their shoulders. This </div>
<div id="tc_147" class="t s1_147">man must be obsessed with food, must be eating too much. He must have been one of </div>
<div id="td_147" class="t s1_147">the fattest men in India, and he suggested to this young man to live only on milk. </div>
<div id="te_147" class="t s1_147">And what was the problem? Why had this young man gone to him? The young man </div>
<div id="tf_147" class="t s1_147">had gone to him to attain BRAHMACHARYA -- celibacy. He had read in the scriptures </div>
<div id="tg_147" class="t s1_147">that unless you are absolutely celibate you cannot reach God. So he asked how to </div>
<div id="th_147" class="t s1_147">become absolutely celibate; now the suggestion was, "Live only on milk." </div>
<div id="ti_147" class="t s1_147">Now this is utter nonsense! If you live only on milk you will be more sexual than ever </div>
<div id="tj_147" class="t s1_147">before, because from where are you going to get the milk? From cows or buffaloes. That </div>
<div id="tk_147" class="t s1_147">milk is not created for man; cows' milk is created for bulls, and bulls are the most sexual </div>
<div id="tl_147" class="t s1_147">animals in the world. Cows' milk has more chemicals to make you sexual than anything </div>
<div id="tm_147" class="t s1_147">else in the world. It is the unholiest food. </div>
<div id="tn_147" class="t s1_147">But who cares? Who thinks about it? </div>
<div id="to_147" class="t s1_147">Just because the scripture says it, Shivananda told him, "You live on milk." Now, it is </div>
<div id="tp_147" class="t s1_147">only man, ONLY man, who lives on milk when he is small and just for a few months. </div>
<div id="tq_147" class="t s1_147">Once he has become able to eat and digest solid food he drops the milk and moves to </div>
<div id="tr_147" class="t s1_147">solid food. It is meant for children. </div>
<div id="ts_147" class="t s1_147">And one of the most important things that is growing in the child is his sexuality. He is </div>
<div id="tt_147" class="t s1_147">becoming more and more mature and sexual, because the whole biology depends on </div>
<div id="tu_147" class="t s1_147">sex. And after a time the child has to move to solid food. It is only man who continues </div>
<div id="tv_147" class="t s1_147">to drink milk. It is okay in coffee or in tea, but just to live on milk -- it is going to be </div>
<div id="tw_147" class="t s1_147">dangerous. </div>
<div id="tx_147" class="t s1_147">The young man became more sexual, and weaker. The body became weaker and the </div>
<div id="ty_147" class="t s1_147">mind became more and more obsessed with sex. Again he went to the same saint. The </div>
<div id="tz_147" class="t s1_147">saint said, "It is because you are suffering from TAMAS -- you are suffering from the </div>
<div id="t10_147" class="t s1_147">very lowest kind of energy called tamas, which pulls you downwards." </div>
<div id="t11_147" class="t s1_147">"What has to be done?" the young man asked. </div>
<div id="t12_147" class="t s1_147">The saint, the so-called saint, said, "You need not sleep as much as you are sleeping, </div>
<div id="t13_147" class="t s1_147">because sleep creates tamas" -- that too is written in the same scriptures: sleep creates </div>
<div id="t14_147" class="t s1_147">tamas -- "so sleep only five hours." </div>
<div id="t15_147" class="t s1_147">First the food was taken away. He was starving, because for a fully grown-up person </div>
<div id="t16_147" class="t s1_147">milk is not enough. He needs solid food; he is not a child. And then the milk is coming </div>
