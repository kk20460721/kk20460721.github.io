<div id="t2_130" class="t s1_130">not a burden. His morality is not something imposed on him. His morality is something like</div>
<div id="t3_130" class="t s1_130">overflowing joy, overabundant rejoicing. He loves because he has so much love. He cannot</div>
<div id="t4_130" class="t s1_130">hate because hate has disappeared from his being.</div>
<div id="t5_130" class="t s1_130">I am reminded of one very great woman -- Rabiya al-Adabiya, a Sufi woman. A great Sufi</div>
<div id="t6_130" class="t s1_130">mystic, Hassan, was staying with Rabiya. In the morning he wanted the holy KORAN. He had</div>
<div id="t7_130" class="t s1_130">not brought his own copy, thinking that Rabiya must have a holy KORAN and that will do.</div>
<div id="t8_130" class="t s1_130">Rabiya gave him her copy. He opened it and he was shocked, because Rabiya had made</div>
<div id="t9_130" class="t s1_130">many corrections in the holy KORAN! To any fanatic religious person, to any fundamentalist,</div>
<div id="ta_130" class="t s1_130">nothing can be more sacrilegious. A Mohammedan cannot think that you can correct God's</div>
<div id="tb_130" class="t s1_130">only messenger, and the last messenger. Now God is not going to send another improved</div>
<div id="tc_130" class="t s1_130">edition of his holy scripture. The last one he sent was the holy KORAN. Mohammedans say</div>
<div id="td_130" class="t s1_130">there is only one God; one prophet, Mohammed, and one holy scripture, the KORAN. And</div>
<div id="te_130" class="t s1_130">this old woman, Rabiya, is making corrections -- she has cut out a few lines completely!</div>
<div id="tf_130" class="t s1_130">Hassan said, "Rabiya, it seems somebody has spoiled your book."</div>
<div id="tg_130" class="t s1_130">Rabiya said, "Nobody has spoiled my book. I have simply corrected it."</div>
<div id="th_130" class="t s1_130">Hassan said, "I cannot understand. I always thought that you were a great religious woman.</div>
<div id="ti_130" class="t s1_130">I cannot conceive that you would do such a thing."</div>
<div id="tj_130" class="t s1_130">She said, "I had to do it. Just look at what I have crossed out!" The sentence in the</div>
<div id="tk_130" class="t s1_130">KORAN was: "When you see the devil, hate him." And she has crossed it out.</div>
<div id="tl_130" class="t s1_130">Rabiya said, "Since I have experienced my innermost being, I don't have any hate left.</div>
<div id="tm_130" class="t s1_130">Even if the devil stands before me, I have nothing to offer but love. I have to correct the</div>
<div id="tn_130" class="t s1_130">KORAN. It is my book; it has to be according to my experience! Mohammed has no</div>
<div id="to_130" class="t s1_130">monopoly. I will not tolerate anything in my book which is against my experience."</div>
<div id="tp_130" class="t s1_130">A man of enlightenment is so full of love, so full of joy, that he shares it. Sharing comes to</div>
<div id="tq_130" class="t s1_130">him without any effort -- it is not an effort, it is not an action. That's why people like Lao Tzu</div>
<div id="tr_130" class="t s1_130">say "actionless action", and "effortless effort".</div>
<div id="ts_130" class="t s1_130">But people like Ta Hui cannot understand that. To them, "effortless effort" and "actionless</div>
<div id="tt_130" class="t s1_130">action" will look like illogical, absurd statements. How can there be an actionless action? How</div>
<div id="tu_130" class="t s1_130">can there be effort without any effort? But I know that once you are awakened, you don't do</div>
<div id="tv_130" class="t s1_130">anything -- everything starts happening. It is just a spontaneous outpouring, just as roses come</div>
<div id="tw_130" class="t s1_130">on rose bushes, without any effort.</div>
<div id="tx_130" class="t s1_130">Love and compassion, good and beauty, grace and blessings, simply go on and on coming</div>
<div id="ty_130" class="t s1_130">out of the overfullness. Just as a raincloud showers without any effort, an awakened man</div>
<div id="tz_130" class="t s1_130">showers also without any effort. And the beauty of no-effort -- and yet tremendous happenings</div>
<div id="t10_130" class="t s1_130">-- is so majestic. It is the ultimate splendor in existence.</div>
<div id="t11_130" class="t s1_130">Gautam Buddha has said ... For forty-two years continuously he was speaking, and at the</div>
<div id="t12_130" class="t s1_130">end he says, "I have not spoken a single word." And he is right, because he has not made any</div>
<div id="t13_130" class="t s1_130">effort to speak. It was just a raincloud showering, it was a rose bush bringing roses with no</div>
<div id="t14_130" class="t s1_130">effort, with no action. Buddha had to speak because he was so overfull. All that poetry, all that</div>
<div id="t15_130" class="t s1_130">music, all that came out of him was simply spontaneous.</div>
<div id="t16_130" class="t s1_130">A moralist makes efforts; he tries to do good, he avoids doing bad. His whole life is</div>
<div id="t17_130" class="t s1_130">continuously "Do this," or "Don't do that." He is always split, and he is always worried about</div>
<div id="t18_130" class="t s1_130">Chapter 10 - Clinging</div>
<div id="t19_130" class="t s1_130">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
