<div id="t2_110" class="t s1_110">You are very cunning and clever; even when you are close you go on protecting </div>
<div id="t3_110" class="t s1_110">yourself in a thousand and one ways. </div>
<div id="t4_110" class="t s1_110">For example, even your questions, your attitudes, are protective. And you don't </div>
<div id="t5_110" class="t s1_110">know what they are protecting. I know one of you, a very miserly woman -- she </div>
<div id="t6_110" class="t s1_110">is here to get enlightenment. But since she has been here she has been asking </div>
<div id="t7_110" class="t s1_110">questions: why the ashram has such a costly car, why I wear a costly watch. </div>
<div id="t8_110" class="t s1_110">What has she to do with the car or the watch? Why are only these questions </div>

<div id="ta_110" class="t s1_110">miser, and unless her miserliness is broken she cannot grow. </div>
<div id="tb_110" class="t s1_110">That is for me to decide, what car to have or not have. And I have my own </div>
<div id="tc_110" class="t s1_110">reasons, and you cannot understand my reasons. I never use it, but I have it. It is </div>
<div id="td_110" class="t s1_110">just sitting there. But it did a miracle; it changed many things. I was surrounded </div>
<div id="te_110" class="t s1_110">by a few misers, marvadis, and they wouldn't leave me. I purchased this car -- </div>
<div id="tf_110" class="t s1_110">they all left. They simply left; they never came again. There were only two </div>
<div id="tg_110" class="t s1_110">possibilities: either they had to leave their miserliness, then they could have been </div>
<div id="th_110" class="t s1_110">here; or they had to leave me. And since they have gone the ashram has a </div>
<div id="ti_110" class="t s1_110">different quality to it. They were dirty people, but I cannot tell somebody to </div>
<div id="tj_110" class="t s1_110">leave. I have to create a device. That car has done more than its cost, but you </div>

<div id="tn_110" class="t s1_110">had come to a spiritual Master and he is after their money. But those who </div>

<div id="tp_110" class="t s1_110">money -- he was interested in breaking their miserliness, because if you are </div>
<div id="tq_110" class="t s1_110">miserly you cannot expand. The whole consciousness of a miser shrinks. </div>

<div id="tw_110" class="t s1_110">ask one hundred dollars for one question, that means one thousand rupees for </div>
<div id="tx_110" class="t s1_110">one question. And maybe he will say "yes" or "no" -- "Now if you have another </div>

<div id="t11_110" class="t s1_110">manuscript and he will take one thousand dollars -- just to look into the </div>
<div id="t12_110" class="t s1_110">manuscript. </div>
<div id="t13_110" class="t s1_110">What was he doing? And he was not at all interested in money: with one hand he </div>
