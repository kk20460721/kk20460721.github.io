<div id="t6_201" class="t s1_201">It was impossible to make any sense out of it, what was happening. It was a very </div>
<div id="t7_201" class="t s1_201">non-sense world -- difficult to figure it out, difficult to manage in categories, </div>
<div id="t8_201" class="t s1_201">difficult to use words, languages, explanations. All scriptures appeared dead and </div>

<div id="tg_201" class="t s1_201">a non-being, what Buddha calls anatta. Boundaries were disappearing, </div>
<div id="th_201" class="t s1_201">distinctions were disappearing. </div>

<div id="t15_201" class="t s1_201">totally relaxed, all functioning relaxed, and yet a light of awareness burns within </div>
<div id="t16_201" class="t s1_201">you... clear, smokeless. You remain alert and yet relaxed, loose but fully awake. </div>
