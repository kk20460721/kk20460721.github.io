<div id="t1_73" class="t s1_73">CHAPTER 7. WHEN THE OCEAN HAS CALLED YOU</div>
<div id="t2_73" class="t s2_73">But man is absolutely unacquainted with joy. He has forgotten the very language of joy. His mind</div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s2_73">is full of tensions, anxieties, anguishes, anger, violence, jealousy. Nothing makes him afraid – they</div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s2_73">are all old companions, he knows them perfectly well. He has lived with them, although it has been</div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s2_73">a suffering, it has been a hell. But this is one of the signiﬁcant factors to be understood about man:</div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s2_73">he can adapt himself to any conditions.</div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s2_73">It happened in Egypt nearabout three thousand years ago:</div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s2_73">There was a monastery, and the</div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s2_73">monastery had an underground graveyard.</div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s2_73">Whenever any monk died, the great stone that was</div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s2_73">covering the way to the graveyard underneath was removed, and the monk’s body was lowered</div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s2_73">down in deep darkness. The tunnel was miles long – a natural tunnel.</div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s2_73">Thousands of monks have been lowered into that tunnel, and according to the Egyptian convention</div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s2_73">every monk was given some money, some clothes, and some food, because he was going for a</div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s2_73">pilgrimage. It was sixty feet deep and miles long.</div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s2_73">It happened that a monk had not died, but was in a coma. Others thought that he had died, and</div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s2_73">they opened the graveyard, lowered the monk, closed the graveyard... and after a few hours the</div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s2_73">monk came to consciousness. He could not believe where he was – immense darkness, darkness</div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s2_73">so deep, as he had never seen, because not even a ray of light had ever entered into that tunnel.</div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s2_73">And such a stink, because so many dead bodies had become rotten – all around there were bodies</div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s2_73">and bodies, and they were all dead.</div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s2_73">He shouted as much as he could, although he knew deep down that his voice would not reach to</div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s2_73">the monks in the monastery because it was sixty feet deep and then a huge rock always closed</div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s2_73">....</div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s2_73">He had himself closed that rock many times. But as a last resort, he tried shouting with all his might,</div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s2_73">”I am alive!” But nobody heard it.</div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s2_73">And you will be surprised to know the immense adaptability of man. You may think that he must</div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s2_73">have committed suicide – you are wrong. He lived in the hope that someday some monk will die,</div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s2_73">and the rock will be removed – then he can shout.</div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s2_73">But meanwhile there was a little food that he has been sent with, and after that food, he started</div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s2_73">eating rotten food sent with other dead bodies which had become just skeletons.</div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s2_73">It took ten years for another monk to die, although this monk was praying every day to God, ”There</div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s2_73">are so many old monks</div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s2_73">....</div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s2_73">” But God has never heard anybody. Over the time of ten years he became</div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s2_73">a cannibal; he started eating the ﬂesh of dead bodies. Not only that, he started collecting the money</div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s2_73">that had been given to each monk when he died, and the clothes – in the hope that when he would</div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s2_73">be rescued, he would take all these clothes and all this money.</div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s2_73">And slowly, slowly he forgot that the graveyard was stinking; he forgot that he was living the ugliest</div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s2_73">life possible. For water, there was nothing else than the water that was coming from the rocks, and</div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s2_73">he knew that the water was from the gutters of the monastery. He started drinking that water; he</div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s2_73">could not have even touched it before, but there was no other way. The lust for life is so tremendous</div>
<div id="t17_73" class="t s2_73">that man can manage</div>
<div id="t18_73" class="t s2_73">....</div>
<div id="t19_73" class="t s2_73">That water which was coming was so dirty, but for him it was almost nectar;</div>
<div id="t1a_73" class="t s2_73">it was life-giving. And he was the only living man in that miles-long tunnel.</div>
<div id="t1b_73" class="t s2_73">The Razor’s Edge</div>
<div id="t1c_73" class="t s2_73">73</div>
<div id="t1d_73" class="t s3_73">Osho</div>
