<div id="t1_43" class="t s1_43">CHAPTER 4. THE ONLY SECRET THERE IS</div>
<div id="t2_43" class="t s2_43">And this is how your old sannyasins used to be: when everything was ﬁnished, they would become</div>
<div id="t3_43" class="t s2_43">sannyasins, they would renounce the world. The reality was that the world had renounced them!</div>
<div id="t4_43" class="t s2_43">He went to the Jaina monk and he said, ”I want to renounce the world” – now there was no world</div>
<div id="t5_43" class="t s2_43">left – ”but I am a very angry man. I have destroyed my whole life because of my anger, and I have</div>
<div id="t6_43" class="t s2_43">come to your feet, to be initiated. All I want is you to somehow help me to get rid of my anger.”</div>
<div id="t7_43" class="t s2_43">In Jainism there are ﬁve stages of initiation. At the ﬁfth stage the sannyasin has to become naked.</div>
<div id="t8_43" class="t s2_43">Slowly, slowly he has to drop things: some clothes, less clothes, then one cloth, and then ﬁnally he</div>
<div id="t9_43" class="t s2_43">becomes naked.</div>
<div id="ta_43" class="t s2_43">The master asked him, ”At what stage do you want to be initiated?” He said, ”Is that a question to</div>
<div id="tb_43" class="t s2_43">ask me? At the ﬁnal stage.”</div>
<div id="tc_43" class="t s2_43">This is the same man who had burned the house, who had killed his wife – the same angry man.</div>
<div id="td_43" class="t s2_43">But the Jaina monk was very happy. He said, ”So many have come to me, but they always start from</div>
<div id="te_43" class="t s2_43">the ﬁrst stage. You are really courageous.”</div>
<div id="tf_43" class="t s2_43">He was not courageous, he was simply an angry man, revengeful.</div>
<div id="tg_43" class="t s2_43">Now he was taking revenge</div>
<div id="th_43" class="t s2_43">with himself. He had been angry to his wife, he had been angry to the architect, he had destroyed</div>
<div id="ti_43" class="t s2_43">everything in anger. Now he wanted to destroy himself. The anger was turning upon himself.</div>
<div id="tj_43" class="t s2_43">But the Jaina monk misunderstood; he was not a master. He initiated him and because of his anger</div>
<div id="tk_43" class="t s2_43">he gave him a new name, Muni Shantinath. Shantinath means master of peace. And Shantinath</div>
<div id="tl_43" class="t s2_43">started great austerities – very soon he had defeated his master. It was a question of his old ego</div>
<div id="tm_43" class="t s2_43">and his anger. He started torturing himself as much as possible. It was the same anger. If there</div>
<div id="tn_43" class="t s2_43">had been a master with eyes to see, he would have seen that the man was not changing, he was</div>
<div id="to_43" class="t s2_43">the same man. The actions were different, but the approach, the attitude, the energy was the same.</div>
<div id="tp_43" class="t s2_43">Shantinath became very famous.</div>
<div id="tq_43" class="t s2_43">After twenty years, when he had become famous all over the</div>
<div id="tr_43" class="t s2_43">country, one of his friends came to see him. He was staying in the capital. There were thousands</div>
<div id="ts_43" class="t s2_43">of followers and they said they had seen many monks, but they had never seen such austerity, such</div>
<div id="tt_43" class="t s2_43">asceticism, such sacriﬁce, such devotion, such utter renunciation of all comforts.</div>
<div id="tu_43" class="t s2_43">The friend went to see. He looked at the face; he could not see any difference. Those eyes were</div>
<div id="tv_43" class="t s2_43">still burning with anger. It was not the ﬁre of self-realization, it was the ﬁre of anger. He came close</div>
<div id="tw_43" class="t s2_43">to the stage where the great master, Shantinath, was sitting. He asked him, ”Master?”</div>
<div id="tx_43" class="t s2_43">Shantinath had seen him, had recognized him, but it was below him to recognize that he had</div>
<div id="ty_43" class="t s2_43">recognized him. He was a great master, and the friend was an ordinary human being.</div>
<div id="tz_43" class="t s2_43">The friend could see that he had recognized him, but that he did not want to accept it. He came</div>
<div id="t10_43" class="t s2_43">closer and said, ”I’m very much impressed by Your Holiness. Just one thing I want to know: what is</div>
<div id="t11_43" class="t s2_43">your name?”</div>
<div id="t12_43" class="t s2_43">And Shantinath was already angry.</div>
<div id="t13_43" class="t s2_43">He said, ”You don’t listen to the radio?</div>
<div id="t14_43" class="t s2_43">You don’t watch the</div>
<div id="t15_43" class="t s2_43">television? You don’t read newspapers?”</div>
<div id="t16_43" class="t s2_43">The Sword and the Lotus</div>
<div id="t17_43" class="t s2_43">43</div>
<div id="t18_43" class="t s3_43">Osho</div>
