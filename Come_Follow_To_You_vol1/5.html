<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">irony! -- they had been waiting for centuries for this man to happen, all their </div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">hope was with this man who would transform their lives and who would bring </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">the kingdom of God on earth... and then this man happened and they </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">themselves, who had been waiting for him, could not believe, could not trust. </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">What happened? </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">They became too addicted to waiting itself. "Now, if this is the man, then what </div>

<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">they had waited so long -- in fact, waiting itself had become their whole activity, </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">their whole religious activity: waiting for the son of God to come. And now </div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">suddenly this man is there and says, "I am here." </div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">But now they would rather cling to their waiting than look at this man -- because </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">to look at this man will be the end; now there is nothing else to wait for. Future </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">disappears, hope disappears, desire disappears. This man will kill all hoping, all </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">desiring, all future -- that is too much! The old mind has become addicted to its </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">own waiting, the old mind has become addicted to its own misery, frustration -- </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">now it is too much. </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">It happens: if you have been ill very long, by and by you start having a certain </div>

<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">fear arises because you will have to go to the office again, to the marketplace. For </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">these few years you have been resting: there has been no anxiety; you could </div>

<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">you have been ill, everybody has been sympathetic to you, almost everybody </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">tried to love you. You have become the center of your family, friends, </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">acquaintances; everybody has been kind. To move again in the harsh and cruel </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">world: the mind recoils back; it doesn't seem worth it. </div>

<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">They are still waiting -- and the man has happened and gone. But they have </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">invested too much in waiting: their waiting has become their prayer, their </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">synagogues are nothing but waiting rooms for the messiah to come. And he has </div>

<div id="t16_5" class="t s1_5">Jews have been insistently emphasizing that God's name should not be asserted </div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s1_5">because it is something to keep deep down in the heart. To assert it is to make it </div>
<div id="t18_5" class="t s1_5">profane; to say it is to make it part of the ordinary world and language. To say it </div>
