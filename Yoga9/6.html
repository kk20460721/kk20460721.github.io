<div id="t2_6" class="t s1_6">going; it is none of your responsibility. But your mental body, your manumaya kosha, </div>
<div id="t3_6" class="t s1_6">will suffer tremendously, terribly it will not grow. You will not have your Own mind, and </div>
<div id="t4_6" class="t s1_6">you will miss something very, very beautiful and some -- thing which functions as a </div>
<div id="t5_6" class="t s1_6">bridge for higher growth. </div>
<div id="t6_6" class="t s1_6">So always remember, whatsoever I say to you, you can take it in two ways. You can </div>
<div id="t7_6" class="t s1_6">simply take it on my authority"Osho says so, it must be true" -- then you will suffer, then </div>
<div id="t8_6" class="t s1_6">you will not grow. Whatsoever I say, listen to it, try to understand it, implement it in your </div>
<div id="t9_6" class="t s1_6">life, see how it works, and then come to your own conclusions. They may be the same, </div>
<div id="ta_6" class="t s1_6">they may not be. They can never be exactly the same because you have a different </div>
<div id="tb_6" class="t s1_6">personality, a unique being. Whatsoever I am saying is my own. It is bound to be in deep </div>
<div id="tc_6" class="t s1_6">ways rooted in me. You may come to similar conclusions, but they cannot be exactly the </div>
<div id="td_6" class="t s1_6">same. So my conclusions should not be made your conclusions. You should try to </div>
<div id="te_6" class="t s1_6">understand me, you should try to learn, but you should not collect knowledge from me, </div>
<div id="tf_6" class="t s1_6">you should not collect conclusions from me. Then your mindbody will grow. </div>
<div id="tg_6" class="t s1_6">But people take shortcuts. They say, "If you have known, finished. What is the need for </div>
<div id="th_6" class="t s1_6">us to try and experiment? We will believe in you." A believer has no manumaya kosha. </div>
<div id="ti_6" class="t s1_6">He has a false manumaya kosha which has not come out of his own being but has been </div>
<div id="tj_6" class="t s1_6">forced from without. </div>
<div id="tk_6" class="t s1_6">Then higher than manumaya kosha, bigger than manumaya kosha, is vigyanamaya kosha </div>

<div id="tm_6" class="t s1_6">beyond reason; has become very, very subtle; it is an intuitive grasp. It is a seeing directly </div>
<div id="tn_6" class="t s1_6">into the nature of things. It is not trying to think about it. The cypress tree in the </div>
<div id="to_6" class="t s1_6">courtyard: you just look at it. You don't think about it; there is no "about" in intuition. </div>

<div id="tr_6" class="t s1_6">You are not searching even. You are simply waiting, and reality reveals -- it is a </div>
<div id="ts_6" class="t s1_6">revelation. The intuitive body takes you to very far out horizons, but still there is one </div>
<div id="tt_6" class="t s1_6">body more. </div>
<div id="tu_6" class="t s1_6">That is the fifth body, ANANDAMAYA KOSHA_ bliss body. That is really far out. It is </div>
<div id="tv_6" class="t s1_6">made of pure bliss. Even intuition is transcended. </div>
<div id="tw_6" class="t s1_6">These five seeds are just seeds, remember. Beyond these five is your reality. These are </div>
<div id="tx_6" class="t s1_6">just seeds surrounding you. The first is very gross; you are almost confined in a six-foot </div>
<div id="ty_6" class="t s1_6">body. The second is bigger than it, the third still bigger, the fourth still bigger, the fifth is </div>
<div id="tz_6" class="t s1_6">very big; but still these are seeds. All are limited. If all the seeds are dropped and you </div>
<div id="t10_6" class="t s1_6">stand nude in your reality, then you are infinite. That's what yoga says: you are God -- </div>

<div id="t12_6" class="t s1_6">barriers are dropped. </div>
<div id="t13_6" class="t s1_6">Try to understand this. The barriers are there surrounding you in circles. The first barrier </div>
<div id="t14_6" class="t s1_6">is very, very hard. To get out of it is very difficult. People remain confined to their </div>
<div id="t15_6" class="t s1_6">physical bodies and they think their physical life is all that there is to life. Don't settle. </div>
<div id="t16_6" class="t s1_6">The physical body is just a step to the energy body. The energy body is again just a step </div>
<div id="t17_6" class="t s1_6">for the mind body. That too in its turn is just a step for the intuitive body. That too is a </div>
<div id="t18_6" class="t s1_6">step for the bliss body. And from the bliss 60dy you take the jump -- now there are no </div>
<div id="t19_6" class="t s1_6">more steps -- you take the jump into the abyss of your being, that is infinity, eternity. </div>
