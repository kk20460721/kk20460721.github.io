<div id="t2_137" class="t s1_137">Lukowski glanced in the mirror and heaved a sigh of relief. "Yeah," he said, "it is me </div>
<div id="t3_137" class="t s1_137">alright." </div>
<div id="t4_137" class="t s1_137">That is how you recognize yourself, always looking in the mirror. The mirrors differ. </div>
<div id="t5_137" class="t s1_137">You look in the eyes of other people; if they think you are a good man, you think you </div>
<div id="t6_137" class="t s1_137">are a good man. If they think you are beautiful, you think you are beautiful. If they </div>
<div id="t7_137" class="t s1_137">think you are intelligent, you think you are intelligent. All that you know about yourself </div>
<div id="t8_137" class="t s1_137">is collected from others -- others who don't even know themselves. </div>
<div id="t9_137" class="t s1_137">This is a very strange world: you are asking people, "Who are you?" and they don't </div>
<div id="ta_137" class="t s1_137">know themselves, and you depend on what they say about you -- you depend on it. </div>
<div id="tb_137" class="t s1_137">You go on collecting information. That's why it hurts when somebody says you are a </div>
<div id="tc_137" class="t s1_137">fool. Why does it hurt? Let him say that you are a fool; just by his saying it you don't </div>
<div id="td_137" class="t s1_137">become a fool. But why does it hurt then? It hurts because all that you know about </div>
<div id="te_137" class="t s1_137">yourself depends on public opinion. Now that opinion comes from the same source -- </div>
<div id="tf_137" class="t s1_137">from the outside -- from where you have been collecting the opinion that you are very </div>
<div id="tg_137" class="t s1_137">intelligent. Now you are in a contradiction, that's why you are upset, disturbed. Now he </div>
<div id="th_137" class="t s1_137">has created a contradiction. Now he has created trouble for you, he has created a </div>
<div id="ti_137" class="t s1_137">dilemma. Now you are again confused, you don't know who you are. </div>
<div id="tj_137" class="t s1_137">A Sufi parable: </div>
<div id="tk_137" class="t s1_137">A Sufi stayed in a caravanserai but there was no empty room available. So the manager </div>
<div id="tl_137" class="t s1_137">said, "You will have to share the room with somebody else." </div>
<div id="tm_137" class="t s1_137">The Sufi said, "That is going to create trouble because when I am alone in my room, in </div>
<div id="tn_137" class="t s1_137">the morning when I wake up I know perfectly well it is me, but when there are two </div>
<div id="to_137" class="t s1_137">persons in the morning, how am I going to decide who is who?" </div>
<div id="tp_137" class="t s1_137">While this strange conversation was going on, the man with whom the Sufi was to </div>
<div id="tq_137" class="t s1_137">share the room was also listening to the whole thing. He had a great idea. The manager </div>
<div id="tr_137" class="t s1_137">said, "That seems to be a relevant point" -- because the manager had come across these </div>
<div id="ts_137" class="t s1_137">mad Sufis many times: "They are always saying strange things. Now what is this thing </div>
<div id="tt_137" class="t s1_137">he is talking about?" </div>
<div id="tu_137" class="t s1_137">But the Sufi was saying something really significant: how do you know in the morning </div>
<div id="tv_137" class="t s1_137">who is who? When there are two persons and there has been a gap of the whole night's </div>
<div id="tw_137" class="t s1_137">sleep, how to gather again that "I am myself"? </div>
<div id="tx_137" class="t s1_137">The manager said, "I have come across many Sufis and slowly slowly, I have learned </div>
<div id="ty_137" class="t s1_137">many things about them. Do one thing: take this rope with you and when you go to </div>
<div id="tz_137" class="t s1_137">sleep tie this rope around your feet so when in the morning you see the rope around </div>
<div id="t10_137" class="t s1_137">your feet you will know it is you." </div>
<div id="t11_137" class="t s1_137">The Sufi said, "That seems to be sensible." </div>
<div id="t12_137" class="t s1_137">In the night, in the middle of the night, when the Sufi was snoring, the other man took </div>
<div id="t13_137" class="t s1_137">away the rope just to play some mischief, tied the rope around his own feet and went to </div>
<div id="t14_137" class="t s1_137">sleep. And in the morning there was havoc! The Sufi woke up; the other man was still </div>
<div id="t15_137" class="t s1_137">sleeping. He shook him and he said, "Now I know you are the Sufi, but then who am I? </div>
