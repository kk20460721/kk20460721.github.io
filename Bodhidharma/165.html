<div id="t1_165" class="t s1_165">Bodhidharma has insights which are unparalleled. There have been many </div>
<div id="t2_165" class="t s1_165">disciples of Gautam Buddha who have attained to enlightenment, but nobody </div>
<div id="t3_165" class="t s1_165">has shown such great insightfulness. Either they have remained silent or they </div>
<div id="t4_165" class="t s1_165">have spoken, but neither their silence nor their speaking has reached to the </div>
<div id="t5_165" class="t s1_165">heights and to the depths of consciousness. </div>
<div id="t6_165" class="t s1_165">Perhaps the reason is that Bodhidharma is unafraid of what he is saying. He </div>
<div id="t7_165" class="t s1_165">knows no fear. He has no concern with what people will think about his </div>
<div id="t8_165" class="t s1_165">statements. He does not take into account anybody else when he is speaking. It is </div>
<div id="t9_165" class="t s1_165">almost as if he is speaking to himself. </div>
<div id="ta_165" class="t s1_165">For nine years he was sitting before a wall and when people would come, they </div>
<div id="tb_165" class="t s1_165">would have to sit behind him. They could ask questions but Bodhidharma would </div>
<div id="tc_165" class="t s1_165">answer only to the wall. He was not at all concerned about who was asking the </div>
<div id="td_165" class="t s1_165">question; he was more concerned with his own insight. </div>
<div id="te_165" class="t s1_165">Just last night I received the last book of J. Krishnamurti, in which he is not </div>
<div id="tf_165" class="t s1_165">speaking to anybody -- he is speaking just to himself. The words are recorded but </div>
<div id="tg_165" class="t s1_165">there was no audience, and perhaps in this book he comes closer to truth than in </div>
<div id="th_165" class="t s1_165">any of his other books. The audience is a limitation. </div>
<div id="ti_165" class="t s1_165">This has been my experience too. If I am speaking to my own people, then there </div>
<div id="tj_165" class="t s1_165">is no limitation; then I don't feel that I have to say something, or not to say </div>
<div id="tk_165" class="t s1_165">something. Then I simply speak as if I am speaking to myself. When I am </div>
<div id="tl_165" class="t s1_165">speaking to people who don't know me, who don't understand me -- moreover </div>
<div id="tm_165" class="t s1_165">they misunderstand me -- there is a great limitation. Then I am not at freedom to </div>
<div id="tn_165" class="t s1_165">speak. Their very faces, their eyes, their gestures prevent me from saying </div>
<div id="to_165" class="t s1_165">something that may hurt them. </div>
<div id="tp_165" class="t s1_165">Just a few days ago, seventy people from the TIMES OF INDIA group of papers </div>
<div id="tq_165" class="t s1_165">came to have an exclusive interview with me. The owners were also present -- </div>
<div id="tr_165" class="t s1_165">Samir Jain, Nandita Jain and their mother Indu Jain were also present. But the </div>
<div id="ts_165" class="t s1_165">strangest thing that I immediately felt as I entered the auditorium ...so ugly, so </div>
<div id="tt_165" class="t s1_165">inhuman and so uncultured: when I was giving my greetings with folded hands </div>
<div id="tu_165" class="t s1_165">to everybody, those seventy people, including Indu Jain, could not even respond. </div>
<div id="tv_165" class="t s1_165">That is, in India, a simple thing. Even a stranger on the street folds his hands. It </div>
<div id="tw_165" class="t s1_165">need not be known to you who he is, but you respond because a folded-hands </div>
<div id="tx_165" class="t s1_165">greeting has a spiritual meaning. </div>
<div id="ty_165" class="t s1_165">Shaking hands has no spiritual meaning; shaking hands has a very mundane </div>
<div id="tz_165" class="t s1_165">meaning. You have to shake with your right hand. It was a device created by the </div>
<div id="t10_165" class="t s1_165">West to show that you are not keeping any weapon in your right hand. It was </div>
<div id="t11_165" class="t s1_165">not a greeting -- it was a search. It was being alert that the man is not an enemy, </div>
<div id="t12_165" class="t s1_165">that he cannot do any harm because his right hand is empty. The reason for </div>
<div id="t13_165" class="t s1_165">shaking hands and its psychology is totally different; in a way very mean, </div>
<div id="t14_165" class="t s1_165">political. </div>
<div id="t15_165" class="t s1_165">But greeting somebody with folded hands has a spiritual meaning: first, that I </div>
<div id="t16_165" class="t s1_165">bow down to your godliness. Whether you are a stranger, friend or enemy, it </div>
<div id="t17_165" class="t s1_165">does not matter; still you are a temple of god, of a living god. Those folded hands </div>
