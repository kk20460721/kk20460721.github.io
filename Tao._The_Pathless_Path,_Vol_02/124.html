<div id="t1_124" class="t s1_124">CHAPTER 7. A TREE GROWS</div>
<div id="t2_124" class="t s2_124">The Master says, ’Sit down, ﬁrst sit down.’ And it is not only that the body should sit down, the deep</div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s2_124">indication is towards the mind. Let the mind settle down. Only then will one be able to understand</div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s2_124">what the Master is going to say... that’s what he means when he says, ’SIT DOWN, I WILL TELL</div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s2_124">YOU.’</div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s2_124">Remember, only when the mind is in a deeply settled state will you be receptive. Otherwise, if the</div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s2_124">mind is stirred and there are clouds and dust arising all over, you are in a sort of storm. Then how</div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s2_124">are you going to receive the Master’s answer?</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s2_124">These are not philosophical discussions, these are penetrations into reality, into your own nature.</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s2_124">And the answers to the questions that are being asked are not meant to satisfy curious people.</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s2_124">One day it happened that a great philosopher came to Buddha. Buddha was sitting under a tree.</div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s2_124">This man, Buddha, must have loved trees tremendously. He was always sitting under a tree. He</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s2_124">became enlightened under a tree – although it is not such a big thing to become enlightened under</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s2_124">a tree; many people have. But you will be surprised to know that Buddha was also born under a</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s2_124">tree. And he died under a tree as well.</div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s2_124">Although Buddha was a king’s son he was not born in a palace. His mother was travelling and they</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s2_124">came to a garden and suddenly she felt the pain arising. There was no other place so she got down,</div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s2_124">stood under a tree and Buddha was born.</div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s2_124">Later he became enlightened under a tree and then,</div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s2_124">when he was dying, he again lay down under a tree and died under it.</div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s2_124">He must have loved trees very much. For ﬁve hundred years after him the tree remained his symbol.</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s2_124">For ﬁve hundred years no statue of him was made – just trees were painted. Trees were placed in</div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s2_124">temples and people worshipped the trees. In a way it was very beautiful.</div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s2_124">I would like to remind you again – the tree is symbolic of religion because it grows. And it grows out</div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s2_124">of the innermost core.</div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s2_124">Buddha was sitting under a tree and this great philosopher said, ’Have you said everything that you</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s2_124">know?’ Buddha had become very old – almost eighty years old – and within a few months he would</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s2_124">be gone. The great philosopher had come from a long way to enquire if he had said all that he knew.</div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s2_124">And Buddha took a few dry leaves in his hand and asked the philosopher, ’What do you think, sir?</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s2_124">How many leaves have I got in my hand? Are they more than the number of dry leaves in this forest?’</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s2_124">The paths, the whole forest, was full of dry leaves; the wind was blowing here and there and the dry</div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s2_124">leaves were making much noise and much music. The philosopher looked and he said, ’What type</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s2_124">of question are you asking? How can you have more leaves in your hand? You have only a few, a</div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s2_124">dozen at the most, and there are millions of leaves in this forest.’ And Buddha said, ’So re-member.</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s2_124">That which I have said is only like the few leaves in my hand. And that which I have not said is like</div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s2_124">the dry leaves in this forest.’</div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s2_124">The philosopher said, ’Then one question more.</div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s2_124">Why have you not said that?’</div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s2_124">Buddha said,</div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s2_124">’Because it will not help you to attain nirvana, it will not help you to meditate – that’s why I have</div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s2_124">not said it. And moreover, it cannot be said. Even if I wanted to say it, it cannot be said. You will</div>
<div id="t16_124" class="t s2_124">have to experience and know it. It is experiential, it is existential.’</div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s2_124">Tao: The Pathless Path, Vol 2</div>
