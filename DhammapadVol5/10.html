<div id="t2_10" class="t s1_10">small part of man is conscious, a very tiny part. The major part of his being is </div>
<div id="t3_10" class="t s1_10">unconscious, is in darkness; you see only the tip of the iceberg, the rest is in darkness. </div>
<div id="t4_10" class="t s1_10">And from that dark continent which is your unconscious come all the motives, desires, </div>
<div id="t5_10" class="t s1_10">instincts, urges -- and the conscious has to follow them. The conscious is only a servant, </div>
<div id="t6_10" class="t s1_10">it is not a master; it is in the service of the unconscious. The unconscious becomes angry </div>
<div id="t7_10" class="t s1_10">and the conscious follows suit; the unconscious becomes full of a sexual urge and the </div>
<div id="t8_10" class="t s1_10">conscious follows it. And the conscious has become very clever in rationalizing. It </div>

<div id="ta_10" class="t s1_10">laughs at it. </div>
<div id="tb_10" class="t s1_10">Just watch yourself. If you are angry you never say, "I was angry because of my </div>

<div id="te_10" class="t s1_10">the person had to be punished, he had to be taught a lesson. I was angry because I </div>
<div id="tf_10" class="t s1_10">WANTED to be." </div>
<div id="tg_10" class="t s1_10">This is rationalization. You were angry because you could not be otherwise; you were </div>
<div id="th_10" class="t s1_10">not the master of the situation. It was not within your hands to choose to be angry -- or </div>
<div id="ti_10" class="t s1_10">not to be angry. You were driven by anger and it came from some basement of your </div>
<div id="tj_10" class="t s1_10">being. It came like a cloud, it came like great smoke and you were blinded by it. You </div>
<div id="tk_10" class="t s1_10">were surrounded by the cloud and you drifted with it, but later on just to save your </div>
<div id="tl_10" class="t s1_10">face, your ego, your pride, you start rationalizing. You say, "I did it." You have NOT </div>
