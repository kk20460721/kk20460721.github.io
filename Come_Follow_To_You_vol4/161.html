<div id="t1_161" class="t s1_161">subtle and profound. You may not have been able to see it; that I can understand. </div>
<div id="t2_161" class="t s1_161">His celebration must have been so deep that you could not go that deep, and you </div>
<div id="t3_161" class="t s1_161">could not feel it. He lived out of his heart, he lived out of his depth. You may </div>
<div id="t4_161" class="t s1_161">have missed, because to look into the depth of a man like Jesus or Buddha is to </div>
<div id="t5_161" class="t s1_161">look into abyss: one gets dizzy, one becomes frightened, one closes one's eyes. </div>
<div id="t6_161" class="t s1_161">It is possible that people didn't become aware of Jesus' celebration, but he was a </div>
<div id="t7_161" class="t s1_161">man of celebration. He enjoyed the small things of life. He made everything </div>
<div id="t8_161" class="t s1_161">sacred. He was not an escapist, he did not renounce anything. In fact, whatsoever </div>
<div id="t9_161" class="t s1_161">he touched became sacred, wherever he moved became holy ground. </div>
<div id="ta_161" class="t s1_161">Whatsoever he did, just because he did it, the quality of it was transformed. He </div>
<div id="tb_161" class="t s1_161">lived a life of celebration on the one hand; on the other hand, he continuously </div>
<div id="tc_161" class="t s1_161">created chaos around you. He was living at two ends together: that is his cross. </div>
<div id="td_161" class="t s1_161">That is the meaning of his carrying his cross on his shoulders: he is living two </div>
<div id="te_161" class="t s1_161">polarities together. He is a paradox, he creates chaos, and you can see him </div>
<div id="tf_161" class="t s1_161">dancing amidst the chaos; because these are the two points to remember God. </div>
<div id="tg_161" class="t s1_161">Either you remember Him when you are in deep trouble -- which is the way of </div>
<div id="th_161" class="t s1_161">ordinary humanity -- or you remember Him when you are at a peak of </div>
<div id="ti_161" class="t s1_161">happiness, of bliss -- which is not the way of ordinary humanity. When you are </div>
<div id="tj_161" class="t s1_161">happy, you forget God; whenever you are unhappy, you remember. </div>
<div id="tk_161" class="t s1_161">Jesus created both possibilities together. He created a disillusionment for you, so </div>
<div id="tl_161" class="t s1_161">that you were in anguish and you could pray. Out of your anguish tears can </div>
<div id="tm_161" class="t s1_161">come, and you melt into prayer. You can again call God 'the Father', the whole. </div>
<div id="tn_161" class="t s1_161">And just near your chaos, He is celebrating. If you are capable of seeing, if you </div>
<div id="to_161" class="t s1_161">have eyes, then you will become aware that prayer has two possibilities: one, in </div>
<div id="tp_161" class="t s1_161">unhappiness -- then it is out of helplessness; the other, in happiness -- then it is </div>
<div id="tq_161" class="t s1_161">out of gratitude. </div>
<div id="tr_161" class="t s1_161">Jesus' prayer is different from your prayer: his prayer is of deep thankfulness, </div>
<div id="ts_161" class="t s1_161">your prayer is of helplessness. But he presented both the possibilities together. </div>
<div id="tt_161" class="t s1_161">One day, a quivering man visited a Sufi Master to plead,'Please help me find </div>
<div id="tu_161" class="t s1_161">myself.' </div>
<div id="tv_161" class="t s1_161">During the discussion a messenger of the troubled man appeared.'I thought you </div>
<div id="tw_161" class="t s1_161">would like to know,' said the messenger,'that your business affairs have taken a </div>
<div id="tx_161" class="t s1_161">sudden turn towards prosperity.', </div>
<div id="ty_161" class="t s1_161">The visitor exclaimed to the Master,'Oh, I feel better now. Good-bye.' </div>
<div id="tz_161" class="t s1_161">A month later, the still troubled man returned to repeat his sorrowful </div>
<div id="t10_161" class="t s1_161">request,'Please help me! I cannot bear my agony any longer.' </div>
<div id="t11_161" class="t s1_161">The messenger appeared a second time, saying with a sly grin,'A beautiful </div>
<div id="t12_161" class="t s1_161">woman awaits you at home.' </div>
<div id="t13_161" class="t s1_161">The visitor Leapt up to gasp,'All is well. Good-bye.' </div>
<div id="t14_161" class="t s1_161">A friend of the Master asked him,'How often will that quivering man repeat that </div>
<div id="t15_161" class="t s1_161">pattern of foolish behavior?' </div>
<div id="t16_161" class="t s1_161">Sighed the Master,'Until he sees.' </div>
