<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">You recognize it, but you go on denying still. You go on avoiding it. You don't </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">want to LOOK at it. You escape; you know ways how to escape from it, although your </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">escapes are not of much value. In fact, in escaping also you emphasize truth. </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">Grace and Martha were from a very prim and proper Eastern finishing school, and they </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">were spending their vacations together in New York. They met a bohemian artist and at </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">one of his exhibitions Grace noticed that a canvas of a provocative nude bore a striking </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">resemblance to her girlfriend. </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">"Martha," she gasped, "that painting looks exactly like you! Don't tell me you have been </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">posing in the nude." </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">"Certainly not," Martha stammered, blushing furiously. "He must have painted it from </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">memory." </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">Even your escapes emphasize something from which you are escaping. There is really </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">no way to escape from truth. There is no way to run away from truth because wherever </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">you run, truth is there; in whatsoever direction you run, truth is there. </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">Buddha says: ONE MAN DENIES TRUTH. </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">The first and the most fundamental way of denying the truth is to believe in certain </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">systems. Systems of belief are the most cunning ways of denying the truth. One is a </div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s1_124">Hindu, another is a Mohammedan; one is a Christian, another is a Jew. These are all </div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">ways of denying the truth. Rather than seeking and searching, rather than inquiring, </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">you believe. Belief means you have borrowed it from others, who had borrowed it from </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">others and so on, so forth. Belief means it is not your experience -- and unless it is your </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">experience it is not truth. </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">But belief can give you a very deceptive feeling that you know. The Mohammedan, the </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">Christian, the Jaina, the Buddhist, they all think they know. And what is the cause of </div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">their feeling? -- because they have learned from scriptures, from priests. Like parrots </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">they have become efficient in repeating -- beautiful words, logical systems; but all is </div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">speculation, guesswork. All is imitation. They have not known a single truth in their </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">lives... because a single truth is enough to deliver you. </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">Jesus says: Truth liberates. But remember one thing which he has not said -- or maybe </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">he said it and it has not been reported in the gospels: Truth certainly liberates, but the </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">truth has to be your own. Only then it liberates. If it is somebody else's it creates only a </div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">new bondage, a beautiful bondage; golden chains, maybe, studded with diamonds, </div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">very valuable, difficult to lose because you don't think in terms of chains; you think </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">they are ornaments. Beliefs are chains, not ornaments. </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">A believer is the ugliest person in the world because his belief becomes a barrier into </div>
