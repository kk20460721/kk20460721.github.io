<div id="t1_65" class="t s1_65">CHAPTER 10.</div>
<div id="t2_65" class="t s2_65">standards, was certainly very rich in that village. Dacoits – now Devageet will be in real difﬁculty to</div>
<div id="t3_65" class="t s2_65">spell the word ”dacoit”</div>
<div id="t4_65" class="t s2_65">....</div>
<div id="t5_65" class="t s2_65">It is not an English word, it comes from the Hindi word dacu; but in that sense English is one of the</div>
<div id="t6_65" class="t s2_65">most generous languages in the world. Every year it goes on absorbing eight thousand words from</div>
<div id="t7_65" class="t s2_65">other languages; that’s why it goes on growing bigger and bigger. It is bound to become the world</div>
<div id="t8_65" class="t s2_65">language – nobody can prevent it. All the other languages of the world, on the other hand, are very</div>
<div id="t9_65" class="t s2_65">shy; they go on shrinking. They believe in purity, that no other language should be allowed to enter.</div>
<div id="ta_65" class="t s2_65">Naturally they are bound to remain small and primitive. Dacoit is a transliteration of dacu; it means</div>
<div id="tb_65" class="t s2_65">”thief” – not just an ordinary thief, but when a group of people, armed and organized, plan the act of</div>
<div id="tc_65" class="t s2_65">stealing. Then it is ”dacoitry.”</div>
<div id="td_65" class="t s2_65">Even when I was young, in India it was a common practice to steal rich people’s children, then to</div>
<div id="te_65" class="t s2_65">threaten the parents that if they didn’t pay, then the hands of the child would be cut off. If they paid,</div>
<div id="tf_65" class="t s2_65">then they could save the child’s hands. Sometimes the threat would be to blind the child, or if the</div>
<div id="tg_65" class="t s2_65">parents were really rich, then the threat was direct, that the child would be killed. To save the child,</div>
<div id="th_65" class="t s2_65">the poor parents were ready to do anything whatsoever.</div>
<div id="ti_65" class="t s2_65">Twice they tried to steal me. Two things saved me: one was my horse, who was a really strong</div>
<div id="tj_65" class="t s2_65">Arabian; the second was Bhoora, the servant. He was ordered by my grandfather to ﬁre into the air</div>
<div id="tk_65" class="t s2_65">– not at the people trying to abduct me, because that is against Jainism, but you are allowed to ﬁre</div>
<div id="tl_65" class="t s2_65">into the air to frighten them. Of course my grandmother had whispered in Bhoora’s ear, ”Don’t bother</div>
<div id="tm_65" class="t s2_65">about what my husband says. First you can ﬁre into the air, but if it doesn’t work, remember: if you</div>
<div id="tn_65" class="t s2_65">don’t shoot the people I will shoot you.” And she was a really good shot. I have seen her shoot and</div>
<div id="to_65" class="t s2_65">she was always accurate to the minutest point. She was just like Gudia – she did not miss much.</div>
<div id="tp_65" class="t s2_65">Nani was in many ways like Gudia, very exact as far as details are concerned. She was always to</div>
<div id="tq_65" class="t s2_65">the point, never around it. There are some people who go around and around and around, you have</div>
<div id="tr_65" class="t s2_65">to ﬁgure out what they really want. That was not her way; she was exact, mathematically exact.</div>
<div id="ts_65" class="t s2_65">She told Bhoora, ”Remember, if you come home without him just to report he has been stolen, I will</div>
<div id="tt_65" class="t s2_65">shoot you immediately.” I knew, Bhoora knew, my grandfather knew, because although she said it</div>
<div id="tu_65" class="t s2_65">into Bhoora’s ear, it was not a whisper; it was loud enough to be heard by the whole village. She</div>
<div id="tv_65" class="t s2_65">meant it; she always meant business.</div>
<div id="tw_65" class="t s2_65">My grandfather looked the other way. I could not resist; I laughed loudly and said, ”Why are you</div>
<div id="tx_65" class="t s2_65">looking the other way? You heard her. If you are a real Jaina tell Bhoora not to shoot anybody.”</div>
<div id="ty_65" class="t s2_65">But before my grandfather could say anything, my Nani said, ”I have told Bhoora on your behalf too,</div>
<div id="tz_65" class="t s2_65">so you keep quiet.” She was such a woman that she would even have shot my grandfather. I knew</div>
<div id="t10_65" class="t s2_65">her – I don’t mean literally, but metaphorically, and that is more dangerous than literally. So he kept</div>
<div id="t11_65" class="t s2_65">quiet.</div>
<div id="t12_65" class="t s2_65">Twice I was almost abducted. Once my horse brought me home, and once Bhoora had to ﬁre the</div>
<div id="t13_65" class="t s2_65">gun, of course into the air. Perhaps if there had been a need he would have ﬁred at the person who</div>
<div id="t14_65" class="t s2_65">was trying to abduct me, but there was no need, so he saved himself and also my grandfather’s</div>
<div id="t15_65" class="t s2_65">religion.</div>
<div id="t16_65" class="t s2_65">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t17_65" class="t s2_65">65</div>
<div id="t18_65" class="t s3_65">Osho</div>
