<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">with the body, watch it. Become more and more of a witness. And as witnessing grows </div>

<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">before death. </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">In meditation the ego dies, the ego disappears. Once the ego has disappeared, once you </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">have seen yourself as an egoless entity, then there is no death for you. </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">We can say it in another way: it is the ego that creates the illusion of death. And ego </div>
