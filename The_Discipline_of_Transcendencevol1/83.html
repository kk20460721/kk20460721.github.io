<div id="t1_83" class="t s1_83">these and all that you hope, all that you desire will happen as a consequence. </div>
<div id="t2_83" class="t s1_83">You just be obedient. </div>
<div id="t3_83" class="t s1_83">All the old religions emphasized obedience too much. Disobedience is the only </div>
<div id="t4_83" class="t s1_83">sin -- that's what christianity says. Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden </div>
<div id="t5_83" class="t s1_83">of god because they disobeyed. God had said not to eat the fruit of the tree of </div>
<div id="t6_83" class="t s1_83">knowledge and they disobeyed. That was their only sin. But every child is </div>
<div id="t7_83" class="t s1_83">committing that sin. The father says, 'Don't smoke,' and he tries it. The father </div>
<div id="t8_83" class="t s1_83">says, 'Don't go to the movie,' and he goes. The story of Adam and Eve is the story </div>
<div id="t9_83" class="t s1_83">of every child. And then condemnation, expulsion</div>
<div id="ta_83" class="t s1_83">....</div>
<div id="tb_83" class="t s1_83">Obedience is religion for Manu, Mohammed, Moses. But that world has gone, </div>
<div id="tc_83" class="t s1_83">and through it many have not attained. Many became peaceful, good citizens, </div>
<div id="td_83" class="t s1_83">good members, respectable members of the society, but nothing much. </div>
<div id="te_83" class="t s1_83">Then there is the third emphasis on being adult. Confucius, Patanjali, or modern </div>
<div id="tf_83" class="t s1_83">agnostics -- Bertrand Russell -- all humanists of the world, they all emphasize: </div>
<div id="tg_83" class="t s1_83">'Believe only in your own reason.' That seems very arduous, so much so that </div>
<div id="th_83" class="t s1_83">one's whole life becomes just a conflict. Because you have been brought up by </div>
<div id="ti_83" class="t s1_83">your parents, you have been conditioned by your parents. If you listen only to </div>
<div id="tj_83" class="t s1_83">your reason, you have to deny many things in your being. In fact, your whole </div>
<div id="tk_83" class="t s1_83">mind has to be denied. It is not easy to erase it. </div>
<div id="tl_83" class="t s1_83">And you were born as children without any reason. That too is there. Basically </div>
<div id="tm_83" class="t s1_83">you are a feeling being; reason comes very late. It comes when, in fact, all that </div>
<div id="tn_83" class="t s1_83">has to happen has happened. Psychologists say a child learns almost seventy-five </div>
<div id="to_83" class="t s1_83">percent of his whole knowledge by the time he is seven years old. Seventy-five </div>
<div id="tp_83" class="t s1_83">percent of his whole knowledge he has learned by the time he is seven years old, </div>
<div id="tq_83" class="t s1_83">fifty percent by the time he is four years old. And this whole learning happens </div>
<div id="tr_83" class="t s1_83">when you are a child, and reason comes very late. It is a very late arrival. It </div>
<div id="ts_83" class="t s1_83">comes when, in fact, all that has to happen has happened. </div>
<div id="tt_83" class="t s1_83">It is very difficult to live with the reason. People have tried -- a Bertrand Russell </div>
<div id="tu_83" class="t s1_83">here and there -- but nobody has achieved truth through it, because reason alone </div>
<div id="tv_83" class="t s1_83">is not enough. </div>
<div id="tw_83" class="t s1_83">All these angles have been chosen and tried, and nothing has worked. Buddha's </div>
<div id="tx_83" class="t s1_83">standpoint is totally different. That's his original contribution to human </div>
<div id="ty_83" class="t s1_83">consciousness. He says not to choose any, he says move in the center of the angle. </div>
<div id="tz_83" class="t s1_83">Don't choose reason, don't choose parent, don't choose the child; just move in the </div>
<div id="t10_83" class="t s1_83">very center of the angle and remain silent and become mindful. His approach is </div>
<div id="t11_83" class="t s1_83">tremendously meaningful. And then you will be able to have a clear perspective </div>
<div id="t12_83" class="t s1_83">of your being. And out of that perspective and clarity let the response come. </div>
<div id="t13_83" class="t s1_83">We can say it in another way. If you function as a child, that is a childish </div>
<div id="t14_83" class="t s1_83">reaction. Many times you function as a child. Somebody says something and you </div>
<div id="t15_83" class="t s1_83">get hurt, and a tantrum and anger and temper... you lose everything. Later on </div>
<div id="t16_83" class="t s1_83">you feel very bad about it -- that you lost your image. Everybody thinks you so </div>
<div id="t17_83" class="t s1_83">sober and you were so childish, and nothing much was at stake. </div>
