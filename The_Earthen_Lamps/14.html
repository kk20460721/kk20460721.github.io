<div id="t2_14" class="t s2_14">awake, that emptiness is ﬁlled up. For him that emptiness itself proves to be the great salvation. In</div>
<div id="t3_14" class="t s2_14">that nothingness exists everything. In that emptiness is existence. That existence itself is God.</div>
<div id="t4_14" class="t s2_14">9.</div>
<div id="t5_14" class="t s2_14">I am extremely surprised to see you all worried about life. Life is not known by thinking alone; it can</div>
<div id="t6_14" class="t s2_14">be understood only by living it in full. There is no other way to know the truth. Wake up and live.</div>
<div id="t7_14" class="t s2_14">Wake up and move. Truth is not something dead so that it could be found out without effort. That</div>
<div id="t8_14" class="t s2_14">is an extremely live current. He alone can ﬁnd it who moves with it freely and without bondage. In</div>
<div id="t9_14" class="t s2_14">long term thinking we often lose what is at hand, while what is at hand is the truth and what is at a</div>
<div id="ta_14" class="t s2_14">distance is hidden in it. Is it not unavoidable to discover what is at hand in order to ﬁnd out what is at</div>
<div id="tb_14" class="t s2_14">a distance? Does not the entire future exist in the present movement? Does not the smallest step</div>
<div id="tc_14" class="t s2_14">contain in itself the biggest journey ahead?</div>
<div id="td_14" class="t s2_14">A simple farmer was going to the hills for the ﬁrst time in his life. Although those hills were not very</div>
<div id="te_14" class="t s2_14">far away from his village, even then he had never been able to go up to them. The summits of those</div>
<div id="tf_14" class="t s2_14">hills, covered with greenery, could be seen from his ﬁelds, and very often the desire to see them from</div>
<div id="tg_14" class="t s2_14">a close quarter would become very strong in him. But for one reason or the other, the visit had been</div>
<div id="th_14" class="t s2_14">postponed and he had not been able to go there. Last time, he was detained for the simple reason</div>
<div id="ti_14" class="t s2_14">that he had no lamp with him, and it was necessary to go out in the night itself to reach the hills. The</div>
<div id="tj_14" class="t s2_14">difﬁcult climb of the hills was all the more difﬁcult after the sunrise. But now he had brought a lamp</div>
<div id="tk_14" class="t s2_14">also. and in his excitement of going to the hills he had no sleep at night. He got up at two O’clock</div>
<div id="tl_14" class="t s2_14">in the night and started for the hills. But immediately after coming out of the village he hesitated</div>
<div id="tm_14" class="t s2_14">and stopped. He developed a worry and a suspicion in his mind. Immediately on coming out of the</div>
<div id="tn_14" class="t s2_14">village he saw that it was the new-moon night and it was stark darkness all round. No doubt he had</div>
<div id="to_14" class="t s2_14">a lamp with him, but the light of that lamp would not show beyond ten steps and the climb was about</div>
<div id="tp_14" class="t s2_14">ten miles long. He thought that he had to go ten miles while the light, that he carried, could show</div>
<div id="tq_14" class="t s2_14">only up to ten steps. How could it sufﬁce? And was it advisable to proceed in that stark darkness</div>
<div id="tr_14" class="t s2_14">with the light of that small candle? This would be like embarking on a sea in a very small boat. He</div>
<div id="ts_14" class="t s2_14">kept sitting outside the village to await the sunrise. But about the same time he saw another old man</div>
<div id="tt_14" class="t s2_14">passing by him towards the hills. He carried even a smaller lamp in his hand. When he stopped the</div>
<div id="tu_14" class="t s2_14">old man and narrated his doubt to him the old man started laughing loudly and said: ”Mad man, you</div>
<div id="tv_14" class="t s2_14">move for ten pace to begin with. Move as much distance as you can see. Then you will start seeing</div>
<div id="tw_14" class="t s2_14">the same much again. If you can see up to one step, you can go round the entire world with its help.</div>
<div id="tx_14" class="t s2_14">That young man understood, got up and moved; and before the sun was out he was on the hills.</div>
<div id="ty_14" class="t s2_14">The advice of that old man is worth remembering even on the path of life.</div>
<div id="tz_14" class="t s2_14">I also want to say the same thing to you.</div>
<div id="t10_14" class="t s2_14">Friends, why do you sit tight? Get up and move. Not he who thinks but he who moves, can reach;</div>
<div id="t11_14" class="t s2_14">and may it be remembered that so much discretion, so much light, is possessed by every one as</div>
<div id="t12_14" class="t s2_14">could show the distance for ten steps ahead. And that is enough. That is enough to reach God.</div>
<div id="t13_14" class="t s2_14">10.</div>
<div id="t14_14" class="t s2_14">Love is power; and he alone who lives by love lives in fact.</div>
