<div id="t1_94" class="t s1_94">without any press conference or without any medical examination. They were already burned</div>
<div id="t2_94" class="t s1_94">in the crash, and because they were both Hindus, they were put on a funeral pyre.</div>
<div id="t3_94" class="t s1_94">Most probably, Subhash had been dropped somewhere else, and this plane was purposely</div>
<div id="t4_94" class="t s1_94">burned to create the impression to the British Empire that Subhash was dead; otherwise he</div>
<div id="t5_94" class="t s1_94">was enemy number one, to be caught dead or alive. So, this was a good fiction: he is dead,</div>
<div id="t6_94" class="t s1_94">now there is no point ... and he has even been burned.</div>
<div id="t7_94" class="t s1_94">Taipei gave out the report that he had been put on the funeral pyre -- but there was no</div>
<div id="t8_94" class="t s1_94">point, the bodies were already burned, they were unrecognizable. They had not even</div>
<div id="t9_94" class="t s1_94">photographed those bodies -- which is absolutely necessary for a man with the status of</div>
<div id="ta_94" class="t s1_94">Subhash, for whom the British Empire was bloodthirsty. They should have taken photographs,</div>
<div id="tb_94" class="t s1_94">they should have called medical people to examine the bodies. They should, in fact, have</div>
<div id="tc_94" class="t s1_94">delivered the body to the British Empire. But my feeling is that it was not the body of</div>
<div id="td_94" class="t s1_94">Subhash; it was just a created facade. And that was the feeling of Sardar Chanchal Singh also.</div>
<div id="te_94" class="t s1_94">He, by chance, met me in a restaurant in Jabalpur. He had been released from the Indian</div>
<div id="tf_94" class="t s1_94">jail ... After Subhash left, all the Indian National Army people were again in jail -- but now</div>
<div id="tg_94" class="t s1_94">they were in the jails of the British. But a case was fought for them, and Chanchal Singh was</div>
<div id="th_94" class="t s1_94">released. He was searching for employment, so I told him, "If you have learned any martial</div>
<div id="ti_94" class="t s1_94">arts in Japan, I can arrange a group of college and university students. You can teach them</div>
<div id="tj_94" class="t s1_94">martial arts, and they will pay you enough so that you can survive until you can get other</div>
<div id="tk_94" class="t s1_94">employment."</div>
<div id="tl_94" class="t s1_94">I have told you about Chanchal Singh because he had learned from someone to shout</div>
<div id="tm_94" class="t s1_94">exactly the way Lin Chi must have been shouting -- and I have heard him shout! I don't know</div>
<div id="tn_94" class="t s1_94">Lin Chi -- he must have been more articulate in his shouting ... but even if this man Chanchal</div>
<div id="to_94" class="t s1_94">Singh shouted at you, your mind would stop immediately. If you were going to strike him with</div>
<div id="tp_94" class="t s1_94">a sword, and he shouted, your hand would stop.</div>
<div id="tq_94" class="t s1_94">His shout was so deep, so much penetrating in you, that whatever you were doing you</div>
<div id="tr_94" class="t s1_94">would simply stop. We had tried bringing wrestlers to hit him, to punch his nose. They were</div>
<div id="ts_94" class="t s1_94">expert boxers, but the moment he would shout, their hands would just stop, close to his</div>
<div id="tt_94" class="t s1_94">nose ... Something strange in his sound.</div>
<div id="tu_94" class="t s1_94">Just jokingly we used to use him. somebody was urinating and we would say, "Chanchal</div>
<div id="tv_94" class="t s1_94">Singh, give a good shout." He would give a good shout and the urination would stop! The man</div>
<div id="tw_94" class="t s1_94">would look all around -- what happened?</div>
<div id="tx_94" class="t s1_94">I know perfectly well that there are many stories about Lin Chi, whose shout has awakened</div>
<div id="ty_94" class="t s1_94">people, but it was not an ordinary shout. It was a certain training that enters into the deepest</div>
<div id="tz_94" class="t s1_94">core of your being. The whole problem is that man is asleep. A good shout can wake him up.</div>
<div id="t10_94" class="t s1_94">Even today, in the school of Lin Chi, the shout is being used. But it is not being used on</div>
<div id="t11_94" class="t s1_94">every disciple -- only when a disciple has worked hard with his mind and his mind is tired.</div>
<div id="t12_94" class="t s1_94">Those koans are so tiring because you know that they are absurd. But if the master says, "Find</div>
<div id="t13_94" class="t s1_94">the answer," and you have come to the master to become awakened, then you have to follow</div>
<div id="t14_94" class="t s1_94">whatever discipline he gives you.</div>
<div id="t15_94" class="t s1_94">Those shouts are given only when the mind is almost on the brink of failure, and it is the</div>
<div id="t16_94" class="t s1_94">understanding of the master that now is the time. Then a disciple enters in Lin Chi's room,</div>
<div id="t17_94" class="t s1_94">without expecting that he will shout like a lion's roar for no reason at all ... jump and shout as</div>
<div id="t18_94" class="t s1_94">Chapter 7 - The source</div>
<div id="t19_94" class="t s1_94">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
