<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">light with you, you will never be able to see darkness, because once the light is </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">there, darkness is no longer there. </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">Jesus simply destroys darkness, he destroys guilt. He creates hope, he creates </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">confidence and trust. People who have been condemned for long, have lost all </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">hope. They have accepted their sin, they have accepted their ugly life, and they </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">know that nothing can be done now. They can only wait for hell. They have </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">accepted that they are going to be thrown in hell and they have to suffer. </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">Jesus comes and helps people to come out of their closed darkness. He says, </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">"There is no hell." He says, "Come out. Except for your ignorance, there is no hell; </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">except for your own closedness, there is no hell. Come out of it, flow again. </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">Unfreeze and melt, and live life again. Come in the sunlight. God is available." </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">That's why he says, "Return, the kingdom of God is at hand." He does not say </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">that if you are a sinner then returning will take much time, and if you are a </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">respectable religious man then returning will take less time, no. </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">Just think of the whole thing as if you have dreamed a long dream that you are a </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">sinner. Somebody else in the same room is dreaming that he is a saint. Will it </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">take a longer time for you to get out of your sleep than it will take for one who is </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">dreaming that he is a saint? The saint and the sinner both have been dreaming. </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">They will take the same time to awaken from their sleep. </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">Paradoxically, sometimes it may take a little longer time for the saint, because he </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">is having such a beautiful dream. He does not want to come out of it. The sinner </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">is already in a nightmare. He would like to come out; he is crying, shrieking, that </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">somehow he should come out of it. He is making every effort to come out. The </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">dream is not beautiful, the dream is ugly. He is in hell. But the saint may not </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">want to be disturbed. He would like to turn over to the other side and sleep a </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">little more. </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">Remember, when you feel happy, returning is difficult; when you feel unhappy, </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">returning is easy. That's the meaning of the saying: "There are blessings hidden </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">in misfortunes, hidden in curses." When somebody is happy and everything is </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">running smoothly, who bothers to transform oneself? When one is sad, in deep </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">sorrow, in misery, in tears, then one would like to come out of it. Suffering is also </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">good because it gives you an opportunity to awaken, to come out of your sleep. </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">Nothing is wrong if you can use it rightly. Even poisons can be used as </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">medicines and they can become life-enhancing. </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">If you feel guilty, try to see why you are feeling guilty. Yes, man is helpless. </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">Right! And man is ignorant -- that is right, too. In his ignorance he has done </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">many things which were not as they should be -- that, too, is right. Accept this </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">helplessness, this ignorance, and pray. Let your tears come down, confess, </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">repent, say to God, "I was helpless, I was ignorant, and I could not do better. And </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">I still cannot do better, unless you help. As I am, I will again go wrong. As I am, I </div>
<div id="t15_64" class="t s1_64">will again betray you. I cannot rely on myself. Help me. Only your grace can </div>
