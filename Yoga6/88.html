<div id="t3_88" class="t s1_88">cancer or tuberculosis, old age, and a thousand and one illnesses, and she was </div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s1_88">dragging. You call it death? I call it just dropping the old body to enter into a </div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s1_88">new. Why should I be suffering over it? I should be happy and rejoice in it. It </div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s1_88">depends on the interpretation, and the interpretation is your responsibility. </div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s1_88">Somebody betrays you: but who is saying that it is a betrayal? For instance, your </div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s1_88">lover, your husband, your wife, moves away from you. You say it is a betrayal? </div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s1_88">It is your interpretation. It may be that you were too possessive. He has not </div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">betrayed you; he is simply trying to save himself. You were too possessive. You </div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">were too clinging. You were suffocating his being. You were killing his freedom. </div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s1_88">He has simply tried to save his life -- not betrayed you. He may have moved to </div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s1_88">some other woman in search that, maybe, somewhere else the flower of love can </div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s1_88">bloom. But you forced him; and now you say it is a betrayal. You managed the </div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s1_88">whole thing so that it happens, and now you call it a betrayal? </div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s1_88">Just watch, become alert, look what has happened. If you were not so nagging he </div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s1_88">may not have gone. Your nagging was driving him mad. Or, your nagging was </div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s1_88">driving him insensitive. </div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s1_88">There are only two ways to live with a nagging wife or a nagging husband. One, </div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s1_88">which almost all husbands do, is to become insensitive. You enter the house; you </div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s1_88">make your skin hard. She goes on nagging, you don't bother. You go on reading </div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s1_88">your newspaper. You don't listen to what she says. But then you are betraying </div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s1_88">your own self, because the more insensitive you become, the less loving you will </div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s1_88">be. The more insensitive you become, the less possibility for prayer, the less </div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s1_88">possibility of life happening to you. You are already a dead thing. You are </div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s1_88">betraying your own life. It is better to escape from the woman to save yourself </div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s1_88">and give her also an opportunity to understand -- the other way is to escape. </div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s1_88">If the husband goes on betraying his own life, then the wife says he is very </div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s1_88">faithful. He betrays his own life -- and nobody is responsible for anybody else's </div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s1_88">life. You are here for your own self; I am here for myself. Nobody is here to fulfill </div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s1_88">anybody else's expectations. I have to live my life; you have to live your life. If it </div>

<div id="tx_88" class="t s1_88">can be together. But if you start killing me and I start poisoning you, it is better </div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s1_88">we should separate, because separation will save two lives, will make two </div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">prisoners free. It is not a betrayal. </div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s1_88">There is only one betrayal: and that is to betray one's own life. There is no other </div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s1_88">betrayal. If you continue to live with a nagging, possessive wife, a husband, </div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s1_88">without any love, you are destroying your own opportunity. In the Talmud, </div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s1_88">again, there is a saying that "God will ask you. 'I had given you so many </div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s1_88">opportunities to be happy. Why did you miss?' " He will not ask, "What sins have </div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s1_88">you committed?" He will ask, "What opportunities for happiness have you </div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s1_88">missed? You will be responsible for those." This is really tremendously beautiful: </div>
