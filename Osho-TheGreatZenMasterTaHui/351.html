<div id="t1_351" class="t s1_351">But Lu Tsu had many enlightened disciples. That was his teaching: without saying a word</div>
<div id="t2_351" class="t s1_351">he was saying, "Just sit and look at the wall." Looking at the wall, how long can you go on</div>
<div id="t3_351" class="t s1_351">thinking? -- you will get bored. The same wall ... you may paint it many times in your</div>
<div id="t4_351" class="t s1_351">imagination, but you know it is all imagination. Thoughts will come and float like clouds in</div>
<div id="t5_351" class="t s1_351">the sky, but you know that the sky is always empty. The clouds don't leave any footsteps and</div>
<div id="t6_351" class="t s1_351">slowly, slowly the wall becomes just a screen with no pictures on it, no thoughts on it.</div>
<div id="t7_351" class="t s1_351">Lu Tsu's method reminds me of Bodhidharma. He must have learned at least the idea of</div>
<div id="t8_351" class="t s1_351">facing the wall from Bodhidharma, his ancient master, who for nine years continuously ...</div>
<div id="t9_351" class="t s1_351">Bodhidharma did not even bother first to face towards you and then to turn towards the wall;</div>
<div id="ta_351" class="t s1_351">he used to sit only facing the wall, for nine years continuously! And he had made it known</div>
<div id="tb_351" class="t s1_351">that he would turn around only when somebody who was total in his search came; he was</div>
<div id="tc_351" class="t s1_351">there not for ordinary disciples, but only for extraordinary seekers, who were total.</div>
<div id="td_351" class="t s1_351">One day a man came, and without saying anything he cut off his left hand with his sword</div>
<div id="te_351" class="t s1_351">and threw it at Bodhidharma's feet and said, "This is only the beginning. Either you turn</div>
<div id="tf_351" class="t s1_351">around or I will cut off my head."</div>
<div id="tg_351" class="t s1_351">Bodhidharma turned immediately. He said, "So you have come! No need to cut off your</div>
<div id="th_351" class="t s1_351">head. You have given enough proof of your being a seeker who is really ready to risk."</div>
<div id="ti_351" class="t s1_351">This was the man who was finally chosen by Bodhidharma as his successor; he had the</div>
<div id="tj_351" class="t s1_351">guts, he had the right to be a successor. When asked why he had been looking at the wall for</div>
<div id="tk_351" class="t s1_351">nine years, Bodhidharma said, "Looking at people hurts, because they are buddhas and they</div>
<div id="tl_351" class="t s1_351">don't know it; they are buddhas and they are miserable. Looking at them makes one feel so sad</div>
<div id="tm_351" class="t s1_351">and sorry for them, and there is no way you can help them.</div>
<div id="tn_351" class="t s1_351">"Watching the wall is good, because the wall is not a potential buddha. You don't have to</div>
<div id="to_351" class="t s1_351">be concerned about the wall. And anyway, somebody who can understand me will be able to</div>
<div id="tp_351" class="t s1_351">understand even while I'm facing the wall ... he can at least sit by my side and start facing the</div>
<div id="tq_351" class="t s1_351">wall."</div>
<div id="tr_351" class="t s1_351">And actually many disciples did that. The master is showing the way: what more do you</div>
<div id="ts_351" class="t s1_351">want? Just sit by the side and watch. Watching the wall -- slowly, slowly thoughts disappear,</div>
<div id="tt_351" class="t s1_351">thinking stops, mind evaporates and what is left is your authentic reality.</div>
<div id="tu_351" class="t s1_351">Without finding this authentic reality you will never feel entire and whole, you will never</div>
<div id="tv_351" class="t s1_351">be able to have the feeling that you are part of a great, magnificent, mysterious universe. And</div>
<div id="tw_351" class="t s1_351">not only that you are a part ... you are also the whole. You just have to disappear into the</div>
<div id="tx_351" class="t s1_351">whole, then you are in the trees, and you are in the rains and you are in the clouds and you are</div>
<div id="ty_351" class="t s1_351">in the sky and you are all over.</div>
<div id="tz_351" class="t s1_351">Just to conceive the idea that "I am one with existence" is so relaxing, is so liberating, that</div>
<div id="t10_351" class="t s1_351">even if you want to become miserable, you cannot. I have tried, and I have failed. Sitting alone</div>
<div id="t11_351" class="t s1_351">in my room, I have tried many times to be miserable -- because people go on telling me they</div>
<div id="t12_351" class="t s1_351">are miserable, and I also want to taste what this misery is.</div>
<div id="t13_351" class="t s1_351">But to be frank with you, I have been continuously a failure. I have tried to be angry, I</div>
<div id="t14_351" class="t s1_351">have tried all kinds of things -- but if you have realized your oneness with existence there is</div>
<div id="t15_351" class="t s1_351">no one to be angry with, there is no one to fight with, there is no one to be jealous of. This</div>
<div id="t16_351" class="t s1_351">state is certainly the great affair.</div>
<div id="t17_351" class="t s1_351">Chapter 30 - Be thorough going</div>
