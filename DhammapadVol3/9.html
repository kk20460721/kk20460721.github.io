<div id="t1_9" class="t s1_9">THE WISE MAN TELLS YOU WHERE YOU HAVE FALLEN AND WHERE YOU YET </div>
<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">MAY FALL -- INVALUABLE SECRETS! FOLLOW HIM, FOLLOW THE WAY. </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">When Buddha says, "Follow me," he does not mean imitate him. When he says, "Follow </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">me," he does not say let him be a model to you; make your life according to his life -- no, </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">not at all. "Following" him has a totally different meaning. </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">There is a Zen story: </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">A Zen mystic was celebrating a certain festival which is celebrated only on your </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">master's birthday. But people were puzzled. They asked him, "As far as we know you </div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s1_9">have never had any master. We have also heard rumors that you had approached a </div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">great master, Bokuju, many times, but he always refused to accept you as a disciple. Not </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">only that, he used to chase you out of his hut. We have also heard that because of your </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">continuous persistence, he had beaten you a few times, and once he had thrown you, </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">physically, out of the window of his hut. He never accepted you, he never initiated you </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">-- why are you celebrating this day? This is to be celebrated only on your master's </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">birthday." </div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s1_9">And the mystic said, "Yet, he was my master. His refusal, his throwing me out, his </div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s1_9">constant rejection, was his initiation. He was saying, 'Be a light unto yourself -- there is </div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s1_9">no need to follow me.' Because of his continuous refusal I became enlightened sitting </div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s1_9">under a tree. There was nobody to cling to. </div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s1_9">"The only beautiful man that I have known was Bokuju. If he had allowed, I would have </div>
<div id="tl_9" class="t s1_9">become a shadow to him. If he had allowed, I would have become another Bokuju. I </div>
<div id="tm_9" class="t s1_9">have loved the man, I would have imitated him in detail: I would have eaten the same </div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s1_9">things, I would have walked the same way, I would have said the same things... I </div>
<div id="to_9" class="t s1_9">would have been a carbon copy of him. </div>
<div id="tp_9" class="t s1_9">"But he was great, he was my master -- he refused. He knew where the pitfall is. The </div>
<div id="tq_9" class="t s1_9">moment he looked into my eyes he knew my future, that if he allows I am going to be a </div>
<div id="tr_9" class="t s1_9">pseudo phenomenon, I will never be an authentic individual. Knowing this he was very </div>
<div id="ts_9" class="t s1_9">hard on me. But now I know his hardness was because of his compassion. It is because </div>
<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">of him that I became enlightened. Hence I am celebrating this day -- it is my master's </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">birthday." </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">Somebody asked him, "But your life-style does not show any indication of Bokuju. Your </div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s1_9">statements are utterly different -- not only different but sometimes contradictory to his </div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s1_9">statements. How can you say that he was your master and you are his follower?" </div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s1_9">And the mystic said, "Yes, I say he was my master although he never initiated me </div>
<div id="tz_9" class="t s1_9">formally. But formal initiation is immaterial, irrelevant. And I still say that I am his </div>
<div id="t10_9" class="t s1_9">follower, though I cannot prove it by any documents -- but there is no need to prove to </div>
<div id="t11_9" class="t s1_9">anybody. I know, that's all. I am his follower!" </div>
<div id="t12_9" class="t s1_9">The people insisted, "How can you say that?" </div>
<div id="t13_9" class="t s1_9">And the mystic said, "He never followed his master; I never follow him. That was his </div>
<div id="t14_9" class="t s1_9">basic characteristic: he never followed his master. And I never follow him -- that's how I </div>
<div id="t15_9" class="t s1_9">follow him. I am a follower and he was my master." </div>
