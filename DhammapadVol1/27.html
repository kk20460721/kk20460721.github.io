<div id="t1_27" class="t s1_27">Those who are hotly in hate with me sooner or later will have become devotees -- </div>
<div id="t2_27" class="t s1_27">because you cannot live in hate long. It hurts you. By hating me you cannot love me. </div>
<div id="t3_27" class="t s1_27">Zareen, you are right, it doesn't matter at all to me. If the whole world hates me, it </div>
<div id="t4_27" class="t s1_27">doesn't matter, it makes no difference. I remain in my absolute bliss. </div>
<div id="t5_27" class="t s1_27">My bliss cannot be affected by people's hatred, opposition. But think of those people </div>
<div id="t6_27" class="t s1_27">who are living in hatred -- they are torturing themselves, they are hurting themselves, </div>
<div id="t7_27" class="t s1_27">they are wounding themselves. How long can they go on doing it? Sooner or later their </div>
<div id="t8_27" class="t s1_27">wounds would like to heal. And sooner or later, their very heated antagonism itself will </div>
<div id="t9_27" class="t s1_27">turn into a passionate love. </div>
<div id="ta_27" class="t s1_27">I am reminded, Zareen, of a beautiful story: </div>
<div id="tb_27" class="t s1_27">A Sufi mystic wrote a book on the Koran. It was opposed by all the authorities, by the </div>
<div id="tc_27" class="t s1_27">official religion. They banned it, they made it a crime to read it. It was sacrilegious, they </div>
<div id="td_27" class="t s1_27">thought, dangerous, because he was interpreting the Koran in such a way as nobody </div>
<div id="te_27" class="t s1_27">had ever interpreted it. He was going against the tradition. </div>
<div id="tf_27" class="t s1_27">He called his chief disciple, gave him the book, and told him to go the chief priest and </div>
<div id="tg_27" class="t s1_27">present the book to him -- and watch everything. "Whatsoever happens, you have to </div>
<div id="th_27" class="t s1_27">report it correctly. So be very alert: whatsoever happens...when you give the book as a </div>
<div id="ti_27" class="t s1_27">present, how he reacts, what he does, what he says, remember accurately because you </div>
<div id="tj_27" class="t s1_27">have to report the whole scene. And let me tell you," the master told him, "that this is a </div>
<div id="tk_27" class="t s1_27">kind of test for you. It is not only the question of giving the book to the chief priest and </div>
<div id="tl_27" class="t s1_27">coming back; the whole point is reporting everything as it happens." </div>
<div id="tm_27" class="t s1_27">The man went, very alert, very cautious. Entering into the house of the chief priest, he </div>
<div id="tn_27" class="t s1_27">made himself very alert, shook his body, because everything had to be observed </div>
<div id="to_27" class="t s1_27">minutely. Then he went in. </div>
<div id="tp_27" class="t s1_27">As he presented the book to the chief priest and told the name of his master, the priest </div>
<div id="tq_27" class="t s1_27">threw the book out of the house, onto the road, and said, "Why didn't you tell me before </div>
<div id="tr_27" class="t s1_27">that this is from that dangerous man? I would not even have touched it. I will have to </div>
<div id="ts_27" class="t s1_27">wash my hands now. It is a sin to touch his book!" </div>
<div id="tt_27" class="t s1_27">The wife of the chief priest was sitting by his side. She said, "You are being </div>
<div id="tu_27" class="t s1_27">unnecessarily hard on the poor man. He has not done any harm to you. Even if you </div>
<div id="tv_27" class="t s1_27">wanted to throw the book, you could have thrown it later on. And I don't see the point </div>
<div id="tw_27" class="t s1_27">in throwing it because you have a big library -- thousands of books are there; this book </div>
<div id="tx_27" class="t s1_27">can also be kept in the library. If you don't want to read it, there is no need to read it. </div>
<div id="ty_27" class="t s1_27">But you could have done at least one thing: you could have thrown it afterwards, </div>
<div id="tz_27" class="t s1_27">washed your hands, taken a bath, or whatsoever you wanted to do -- but why are you </div>
<div id="t10_27" class="t s1_27">hurting this poor man?" </div>
<div id="t11_27" class="t s1_27">The man went back, told the master the whole thing as it happened, in minute detail. </div>
<div id="t12_27" class="t s1_27">The master asked, "What is your reaction, then?" </div>
<div id="t13_27" class="t s1_27">The man said, "My reaction is that the wife of the chief priest is a very religious woman. </div>
<div id="t14_27" class="t s1_27">I felt much respect for her. And the chief priest is simply ugly -- I wanted to cut his </div>
<div id="t15_27" class="t s1_27">throat!" </div>
