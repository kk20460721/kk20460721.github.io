<div id="t4_136" class="t s1_136">president, the prime minister, famous, respectable, a Nobel Prize winner. It is not that; it </div>
<div id="t5_136" class="t s1_136">is because of relaxation. </div>

<div id="ta_136" class="t s1_136">stopped his car, went behind a bush. As he was pissing, a wild bee stung his prick. He </div>
<div id="tb_136" class="t s1_136">screamed -- the pain was too much and he did not know what to do. </div>
<div id="tc_136" class="t s1_136">Then suddenly he remembered, twenty years back when he was just a child it had </div>
<div id="td_136" class="t s1_136">happened once and his mother had a remedy for it. She had given him a glass of milk </div>
<div id="te_136" class="t s1_136">and told him to put his prick in the glass, and it had soothed him, calmed him. But </div>
<div id="tf_136" class="t s1_136">where to find the glass of milk? And the pain was excruciating! And tears were coming </div>
<div id="tg_136" class="t s1_136">down from his eyes as he started driving in the hope of finding somebody in the forest. </div>
<div id="th_136" class="t s1_136">He was able to find a small hut. He knocked on the door. He was feeling very </div>
<div id="ti_136" class="t s1_136">embarrassed -- how to say it and what to say? A woman opened the door, but the pain </div>
<div id="tj_136" class="t s1_136">was so much that he had to say something. So he said, "Please don't ask me why, just </div>
<div id="tk_136" class="t s1_136">give me a glass of milk. I am in terrible pain, I am dying! Just give me a glass of milk </div>

<div id="to_136" class="t s1_136">The woman was curious, naturally, as to what was happening. She had never seen such </div>
<div id="tp_136" class="t s1_136">a thing before! So she went back just silently so she would not disturb the man. And </div>
<div id="tq_136" class="t s1_136">what she saw... she could not believe her eyes! She said, "My God, I have been married </div>
<div id="tr_136" class="t s1_136">for thirty years, and now I know how you fill up these things! I was always wondering </div>

<div id="tz_136" class="t s1_136">higher, and then you fall from that height in a deep deep valley of calmness. But this </div>
<div id="t10_136" class="t s1_136">calmness is available to any meditator without creating any tension. </div>
<div id="t11_136" class="t s1_136">Hence, meditation takes you beyond sex; nothing else can ever take you beyond sex. </div>

<div id="t13_136" class="t s1_136">sex; and somebody is running after power -- power is his sex; and somebody is running </div>
<div id="t14_136" class="t s1_136">after something else. Those are all sexualities, substitutes for sex. These people can </div>
<div id="t15_136" class="t s1_136">easily avoid sex because they have found their own new version. </div>
