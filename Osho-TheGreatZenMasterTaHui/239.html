<div id="t1_239" class="t s1_239">Every president and every prime minister is just a beggar, begging for votes. I have heard</div>
<div id="t2_239" class="t s1_239">about an American politician who was campaigning for his election. He knocked on a door,</div>
<div id="t3_239" class="t s1_239">and he started kissing every child -- and there were at least twenty children with running</div>
<div id="t4_239" class="t s1_239">noses, but one has to tolerate everything if one wants power. He was feeling very much</div>
<div id="t5_239" class="t s1_239">disgusted with the whole affair, but he was smiling -- just like the Jimmy Carter smile.</div>
<div id="t6_239" class="t s1_239">Have you heard anything about Jimmy Carter's smile? It has disappeared. I have seen his</div>
<div id="t7_239" class="t s1_239">latest photographs, and only one thing is missing -- that smile. His smile was from ear to</div>
<div id="t8_239" class="t s1_239">ear ... but it was not his smile, it was the chair. With the chair gone, the smile is gone too.</div>
<div id="t9_239" class="t s1_239">The poor politician kissed all the children and the woman who was standing there, then he</div>
<div id="ta_239" class="t s1_239">said to her, "You have beautiful children. I have come to tell you that your vote should go to</div>
<div id="tb_239" class="t s1_239">me."</div>
<div id="tc_239" class="t s1_239">He gave her his card and the woman laughed, saying, "I will think it over. But these are</div>
<div id="td_239" class="t s1_239">not all my children; I am just a caretaker. Because all the woman of the neighborhood are</div>
<div id="te_239" class="t s1_239">having a meeting, they have left their children here, and I am just looking after them."</div>
<div id="tf_239" class="t s1_239">He said, "My God, why didn't you say this before? Now I feel even nauseous! ... these</div>
<div id="tg_239" class="t s1_239">dirty children, with running noses. I have been kissing them, and their mucous was getting on</div>
<div id="th_239" class="t s1_239">my face."</div>
<div id="ti_239" class="t s1_239">But one has to tolerate ...! These beggars become very powerful once they are in the post,</div>
<div id="tj_239" class="t s1_239">but their power is very ugly, inhuman, and brutal.</div>
<div id="tk_239" class="t s1_239">The power of a mystic has a totally different quality, and a different dimension. His power</div>
<div id="tl_239" class="t s1_239">is not dependent on anybody else. His power is not the power of a beggar; his power is the</div>
<div id="tm_239" class="t s1_239">power of an emperor. His power arises within his own being. He becomes a radiant star.</div>
<div id="tn_239" class="t s1_239">All mystics are men of great power. To be in contact with them is enough to be thrilled, to</div>
<div id="to_239" class="t s1_239">be thrilled about the unknown possibilities of your own being. Just to be in the presence of a</div>
<div id="tp_239" class="t s1_239">man of truth is enough; no argument is needed to convince you -- his presence is the</div>
<div id="tq_239" class="t s1_239">argument, and his power is the convincing force.</div>
<div id="tr_239" class="t s1_239">One great Christian missionary, Stanley Jones, used to stay with me whenever he was</div>
<div id="ts_239" class="t s1_239">passing through the place where I was living. He has written beautiful books and he used to</div>
<div id="tt_239" class="t s1_239">give beautiful sermons. Once I told him, "You spoke so beautifully! You were using the same</div>
<div id="tu_239" class="t s1_239">words as Jesus ... but I don't see the power behind them, they are just old gramophone records.</div>
<div id="tv_239" class="t s1_239">The words are the same, but the man behind the words is not the same. You use every effort to</div>
<div id="tw_239" class="t s1_239">make your message emphatic, but you don't have the power."</div>
<div id="tx_239" class="t s1_239">He was a very sincere man, and he said, "Perhaps you are right."</div>
<div id="ty_239" class="t s1_239">I said, "Not perhaps, I am right. If you had that power, which Jesus had, you would already</div>
<div id="tz_239" class="t s1_239">have been crucified. It is hilarious that you hang a golden cross around your neck. Jesus did</div>
<div id="t10_239" class="t s1_239">not hang a golden cross around his neck; his neck hung on a wooden cross, a cross so heavy</div>
<div id="t11_239" class="t s1_239">that although he was only thirty-three years old -- and the son of a carpenter who was</div>
<div id="t12_239" class="t s1_239">accustomed to carrying big logs from the forest to his father's workshop -- he fell three times,</div>
<div id="t13_239" class="t s1_239">the weight of the cross was so much. Whom are you trying to deceive? Your neck has to be on</div>
<div id="t14_239" class="t s1_239">the cross -- not the cross dangling on your neck, a small cross that cannot kill even a mouse."</div>
<div id="t15_239" class="t s1_239">That was the crime of Jesus ... The whole land of the Jews was full of great scholars,</div>
<div id="t16_239" class="t s1_239">intellectuals, great rabbis, and this single man offended them all. He was not speaking against</div>
<div id="t17_239" class="t s1_239">them, he had not said a single word against any of them. But just his presence, his powerful</div>
<div id="t18_239" class="t s1_239">Chapter 19 - Radiance</div>
<div id="t19_239" class="t s1_239">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
