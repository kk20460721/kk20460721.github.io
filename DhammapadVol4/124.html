<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">the joys that I am deprived of here and you are enjoying." The idea of paradise seems to </div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">be just a revenge. </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">I would like this earth to be a paradise -- and it cannot happen without science. So how </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">can I be antiscience? Peter, I am not antiscience. But science is not all. Science can create </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">only the circumference; the center has to be that of religion. Science is exterior, religion </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">is interior. And I would like men to be rich on both sides: the exterior should be rich </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">and the interior should be rich. Science cannot make you rich in your inner world; that </div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">can be done only by religion. </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">If science goes on saying there is no inner world, then I am certainly against such </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">statements -- but that is not being against science, just against these particular </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">statements. These statements are stupid, because the people who are making these </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">statements have not known anything of the inner. </div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s1_124">Karl Marx says religion is the opium of the people -- and he has never experienced any </div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">meditation. His whole life was wasted in the British Museum, thinking, reading, </div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s1_124">collecting notes, preparing for his great work, DAS KAPITAL. And he was so much into </div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s1_124">trying to gain more and more knowledge that it happened many times -- he would faint </div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">in the British Museum! He would have to be carried unconscious to his home. And it </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">was almost an everyday thing that he would have to be forced to leave the museum -- </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">because the museum has to close sometime, it cannot remain open for twenty-four </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">hours. </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">He had never heard about meditation; he knew only thinking and thinking. But still in a </div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s1_124">way he is right, that the old religiousness has served as a kind of opium. It has helped </div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s1_124">poor people to remain poor; it has helped them to remain contented as they are, hoping </div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s1_124">for the best in the next life. In that way he is right. But he is not right if we take into </div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">consideration a Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu -- then he is not right. And these are </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">the really religious people, not the masses; the masses know nothing of religion. </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">I would like you to be enriched by Newton, Edison, Eddington, Rutherford, Einstein; </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">and I would like you also to be enriched by Buddha, Krishna, Christ, Mohammed, so </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">that you can become rich in both the dimensions -- the outer and the inner. Science is </div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s1_124">good as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough -- and it cannot go. I am not saying </div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s1_124">that it can go and it does not go. No, it CANNOT go into the interiority of your being. </div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s1_124">The very methodology of science prevents it from going in. It can go only outwards, it </div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">can study only objectively; it cannot go into the subjectivity itself. That is the function of </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">religion. </div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s1_124">The society needs science, the society needs religion. And if you ask me what should be </div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s1_124">the first priority -- science should be the first priority. First the outer, the circumference, </div>
<div id="t12_124" class="t s1_124">then the inner -- because the inner is more subtle, more delicate. </div>
<div id="t13_124" class="t s1_124">Science can create the space for real religion to exist on the earth. </div>
<div id="t14_124" class="t s1_124">The second question: </div>
<div id="t15_124" class="t s1_124">Question 2 </div>
