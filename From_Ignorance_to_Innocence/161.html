<div id="t1_161" class="t s1_161">CHAPTER 12. FAITH: THE SUICIDE OF INTELLIGENCE</div>
<div id="t2_161" class="t s2_161">But Rabindranath, being a very rich man’s son, was brought up in England, educated in England –</div>
<div id="t3_161" class="t s2_161">so it was easy for him. Although he himself never felt that what he has written in Bengali has really</div>
<div id="t4_161" class="t s2_161">been expressed in English, he still got the Nobel prize for one of his books, GITANJALI: an offering</div>
<div id="t5_161" class="t s2_161">of songs. While he was writing GITANJALI it was his usual practice to go on a small houseboat and</div>
<div id="t6_161" class="t s2_161">live on the river, moving alone, and wherever he liked he would stop the boat. Those were the days</div>
<div id="t7_161" class="t s2_161">when he would compose his poetry.</div>
<div id="t8_161" class="t s2_161">One full moon night he was writing about the full moon, the beauty of the full moon... sitting inside</div>
<div id="t9_161" class="t s2_161">the small room in the houseboat, not at all aware that outside the full moon was there. He was in</div>
<div id="ta_161" class="t s2_161">one of the best beauty spots of the river – for miles there was nothing but silence. Once in a while</div>
<div id="tb_161" class="t s2_161">a water fowl would disturb the silence, but after this disturbance, the silence would become even</div>
<div id="tc_161" class="t s2_161">deeper.</div>
<div id="td_161" class="t s2_161">He was completely unaware; just by candlelight he was writing about the full moon, its beauties. In</div>
<div id="te_161" class="t s2_161">the middle of the night, feeling tired, he blew out the candle, and as he blew out the candle – he</div>
<div id="tf_161" class="t s2_161">writes in his diary – ”a miracle happened. I was shocked, because as the candle was no longer</div>
<div id="tg_161" class="t s2_161">there, from every nook and corner</div>
<div id="th_161" class="t s2_161">....</div>
<div id="ti_161" class="t s2_161">” The hut that was on the houseboat was made of bamboos as</div>
<div id="tj_161" class="t s2_161">they are in Bengal. So from every gap in the bamboo the moon started showering in.</div>
<div id="tk_161" class="t s2_161">For a moment he was struck dumb. He had never seen so much silence. He came out, he saw the</div>
<div id="tl_161" class="t s2_161">moon and he wept. He went back and tore up the poetry he had written about the moon and the light</div>
<div id="tm_161" class="t s2_161">of the moon and the beauty of it, and wrote in his diary: ”I was very unfair to the moon, to the silence</div>
<div id="tn_161" class="t s2_161">of the night. My poetry was just rubbish; it could not represent even a thousandth part. The moon</div>
<div id="to_161" class="t s2_161">was outside just knocking on my door, but I was so much involved in writing my own book, I didn’t</div>
<div id="tp_161" class="t s2_161">hear the knock. I was talking about silence in my poetry and the silence was so profound outside</div>
<div id="tq_161" class="t s2_161">– I have never before come across such silence, nor since. I would have missed it if I had gone to</div>
<div id="tr_161" class="t s2_161">sleep without blowing the candle out. That small candlelight was enough to prevent the moon from</div>
<div id="ts_161" class="t s2_161">coming in.”</div>
<div id="tt_161" class="t s2_161">These people are full of books and words which are not their experiences. And unless something is</div>
<div id="tu_161" class="t s2_161">your experience, don’t go on deceiving yourself. Knowledgeability can be very deceptive; and these</div>
<div id="tv_161" class="t s2_161">religions are responsible for making people knowledgeable.</div>
<div id="tw_161" class="t s2_161">The religions should help people to become innocent, they should help them to become ignorant;</div>
<div id="tx_161" class="t s2_161">they should help them to enquire, search, seek.</div>
<div id="ty_161" class="t s2_161">But rather than that, they have given you everything, presented to you on a plate all the answers that</div>
<div id="tz_161" class="t s2_161">you have to ﬁnd. And what you have lost in receiving their present, you are not even aware of.</div>
<div id="t10_161" class="t s2_161">You have lost everything.</div>
<div id="t11_161" class="t s2_161">You live a borrowed life because they have told you how to live. They have told you how to discipline</div>
<div id="t12_161" class="t s2_161">your life. They have told you how to control your behavior, your nature, and you have been blindly</div>
<div id="t13_161" class="t s2_161">following them, not understanding a simple principle: Gautam Buddha is born only once. For twenty-</div>
<div id="t14_161" class="t s2_161">ﬁve centuries millions of people have tried to become Gautam Buddha – not a single one has</div>
