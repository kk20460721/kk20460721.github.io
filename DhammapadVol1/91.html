<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">A rather simple dude rode into town in the middle of the day stark naked. The sheriff </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">called him over and said, "Jake, what are you doing riding into town with no clothes </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">on?" </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">"Well, sheriff," said Jake, "it is a long story. I was riding into town to get some </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">provisions for my pa, when I came across this lady on the side of the road who asked </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">me for some help. Now my daddy always told me to help gentle lady folk, so I got off </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">my horse and helped her carry her picnic basket down to the river. Then I helped her </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">lay out her blanket, and helped her with everything she asked me to do. Then she said, </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">'How about taking your boots off, cowboy?' So I did, sheriff, and then she said, 'How </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">about taking your clothes off, cowboy?' And I said, 'Sure thing, Ma'am.' And she was </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">there on that rug, naked as the day she was born. Then she lay back and said, 'Go to </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">town cowboy!'...and so here I am, sheriff." </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">Obedience is a form of stupidity -- and the society wants you to be stupid. Stupid </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">people are good people. They remain always with the status quo, they never go against </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">it. Even if they see the rottenness of things, they simply close their eyes, or they are </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">always ready to accept any stupid explanation. </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">For example, this country has been poor for centuries, starving, suffering. But because </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">people are religious, obedient, stupid, they have been given any kind of explanation </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">and they have accepted it. Some believe that God has made them poor because poverty </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">is something very pious. They worship poverty; in India poverty is worshipped. If you </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">renounce your riches and you become a naked fakir, millions of people will think you </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">are a great sage. You may be simply stupid, but just because you have renounced riches </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">you are a great sage. I have seen many stupid sages. </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">Now it is a contradiction in terms -- how can a stupid person be a sage? A sage has to be </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">wise! But it is very difficult in this world to be wise and be worshipped. Wise people are </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">to be murdered, crucified, poisoned. Stupid people are worshipped. Stupid people </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">simply follow whatever the society says. Whatsoever the society wants them to do, they </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">simply do it. So a few people have been worshipping poverty. </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">Gandhi used to call poor people daridra narayana -- "the poor are divine." Poverty is </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">divine! The poor people are gods! If this is true then who would not like to be poor? If </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">poor people are gods, who would not like to be a god? </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">And then there are other explanations: that you are poor because in your past lives you </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">have committed sins. Those explanations have been invented for those people who </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">don't believe in God. The Jainas, the Buddhists, they don't believe in God so you cannot </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">give the first explanation to them. They need another explanation: the theory of karma. </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">But the purpose is the same! If you have committed sins in your past life, then it is </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">better to be finished with the karma. Go through poverty, and go through poverty </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">without any resistance. If you create any resistance, you will again be creating bad </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">karma and you will suffer in your future life. Enough, after all, is enough! Now be </div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s1_91">finished with the whole thing -- suffer at this moment contentedly. So people have </div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s1_91">become cows and buffaloes; they are suffering contentedly, no resistance, no rebellion. </div>
