<div id="t1_116" class="t s1_116">Unmarried women are more at ease with themselves. If politically and economically </div>
<div id="t2_116" class="t s1_116">they were not prevented, they would like, they would love to remain unmarried. </div>
<div id="t3_116" class="t s1_116">Maybe that is one of the reasons why man has made them so helpless politically, </div>
<div id="t4_116" class="t s1_116">socially and economically, so that they HAVE to decide for marriage; otherwise many </div>
<div id="t5_116" class="t s1_116">women would like to remain unmarried. Even if they would like to become mothers </div>
<div id="t6_116" class="t s1_116">they would like to become mothers without marriage. Yes, there is a great need to be a </div>
<div id="t7_116" class="t s1_116">mother in a woman, but there is no great need to be a wife. </div>
<div id="t8_116" class="t s1_116">Men's needs are more physiological; women's needs are more psychological. Hence the </div>
<div id="t9_116" class="t s1_116">woman always feels as if she is exploited in marriage. And her feeling is true, because </div>
<div id="ta_116" class="t s1_116">man's interest is sexual and the woman's interest is far more total; it is not just sexual. </div>
<div id="tb_116" class="t s1_116">Sex may be a part in that totality. But man's interest is basically sexual; everything else </div>
<div id="tc_116" class="t s1_116">is just decorative, it is not essential. He is continuously interested in sex</div>
<div id="td_116" class="t s1_116">....</div>
<div id="te_116" class="t s1_116">The simple </div>
<div id="tf_116" class="t s1_116">reason is that their sexualities are very different. </div>
<div id="tg_116" class="t s1_116">Man has a local sexuality; his sex is confined to the genital organs, it is not spread all </div>
<div id="th_116" class="t s1_116">over his body. The woman is totally sexual, her whole body is sexual; it is not genital. </div>
<div id="ti_116" class="t s1_116">Hence a woman needs longer foreplay before she can go really into lovemaking. </div>
<div id="tj_116" class="t s1_116">And the man is always in a hurry; his love is nothing but a hit-and-run affair! The </div>
<div id="tk_116" class="t s1_116">woman is not even warmed up, and the man is getting dressed and going away! The </div>
<div id="tl_116" class="t s1_116">man is finished. His sexuality is genital. The woman is more total; her whole body has a </div>
<div id="tm_116" class="t s1_116">deep sexuality in it. Unless her whole body becomes involved she can't have orgasmic </div>
<div id="tn_116" class="t s1_116">experience. And if she can't have orgasmic experiences she becomes disinterested in </div>
<div id="to_116" class="t s1_116">sex. So wives are disinterested in sex. Man's whole interest is in sex. </div>
<div id="tp_116" class="t s1_116">The young executive greeted his attractive secretary warmly as he entered the office. </div>
<div id="tq_116" class="t s1_116">"Good morning, Marge," he said, tossing his briefcase on his desk. "I had a dream about </div>
<div id="tr_116" class="t s1_116">you last night." </div>
<div id="ts_116" class="t s1_116">Flattered, but wishing to appear aloof, she casually inquired, "Ah, did you?" </div>
<div id="tt_116" class="t s1_116">"No," her boss replied. "I woke up too soon." </div>
<div id="tu_116" class="t s1_116">Their understanding is different. The woman always feels cheated, used, as if she is a </div>
<div id="tv_116" class="t s1_116">machine. She feels used as a means; it is humiliating. Hence marriage is very </div>
<div id="tw_116" class="t s1_116">humiliating to the woman. It seems only a permanent kind of prostitution, nothing else. </div>
<div id="tx_116" class="t s1_116">She feels as if she has been sold forever. And in the bargain what does she get? A </div>
<div id="ty_116" class="t s1_116">repetitive life, with no creativity, with no joy, with no exploration; a slavery, a constant </div>
<div id="tz_116" class="t s1_116">slavery and the constant humiliation of being used as a means. </div>
<div id="t10_116" class="t s1_116">Of course, if more married women commit suicide that is natural; more married women </div>
<div id="t11_116" class="t s1_116">go mad, that is natural. </div>
<div id="t12_116" class="t s1_116">Lester was continuously nervous and tense, so he went to see his doctor. He was </div>
<div id="t13_116" class="t s1_116">greeted by the lovely, red-headed nurse, and he told her his problem. </div>
<div id="t14_116" class="t s1_116">She said, "That's easy to fix." And she took him into a little room, relieved his tension </div>
<div id="t15_116" class="t s1_116">and said, "That will be ten dollars, please." </div>
