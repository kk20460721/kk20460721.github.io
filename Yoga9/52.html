<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">contrary, meditations have made it feel completely lost." It's a good indication. It shows </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">that the grip of others is loosening. That's why you feel lost, because those voices of the </div>
<div id="t5_52" class="t s1_52">others were giving you guidance, and you had started to believe in them. You have </div>
<div id="t6_52" class="t s1_52">believed in them for so long that they have become your guides. Now, when you </div>
<div id="t7_52" class="t s1_52">meditate, those voices are destructured. You are freed from the trap. Again you become a </div>
<div id="t8_52" class="t s1_52">child, and you don't know where to go. Because all the guides have disappeared. The </div>
<div id="t9_52" class="t s1_52">voice of the father is not there, the voice of the mother is not there, the teacher is not </div>
<div id="ta_52" class="t s1_52">there, the school is not there; suddenly you are alone. One starts feeling scared -- "Where </div>
<div id="tb_52" class="t s1_52">are my guides? Where are people who were always leading me to the right path?" </div>
<div id="tc_52" class="t s1_52">In fact nobody can lead you to the right path, because all leading is going to be wrong. </div>
<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">No leader can be the right leader, because leading as such is wrong. Whomsoever you </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">allow to lead will do some harm to you because he will start doing something, forcing </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">something, giving you a structure; and you have to live an unstructured life, a life free of </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">all structure and character, free of all frames, references, contacts -- free in this moment </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">from the past. </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">So all guides are misguides, and when they disappear, and you have believed in them for </div>

<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">go? </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">This period is a revolutionary period in the life of a being. One has to pass through it with </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">courage. If you can remain in it, unafraid, soon you will start hearing yom voice which </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">has been repressed so long. Soon you will start learning its language, because you have </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">forgotten the very language. You know only the language that has been taught to you. </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">And this language, the inner language, is not verbal. It is of feelings. And all societies are </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">against feelings; because a feeling is such an alive thing, it is dangerous. A thought is </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">dead; it is not dangerous. So every society has forced you into the head, pushed you from </div>
<div id="ts_52" class="t s1_52">all over your body into the head. </div>
<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">You live only in the head. If yom head is cut off and suddenly you come across your </div>

<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">Your whole body has shrunken, has lost luster, softness, fluidity. It is almost a dead thing, </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">like a wooden leg. You use it, functionally it goes on, but no life exists in it. Your whole </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">life has gone into the head. Hung up there, you are afraid of death because the only place </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">that you can live, the only space in which you can live, has to be all over your body. Your </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">life has to spread and stream all over your body. It has to become a river, a flow. </div>
<div id="t10_52" class="t s1_52">A small child starts playing with his genital organs. Immediately the parents are worried -</div>
<div id="t11_52" class="t s1_52">- "Stop it!" The worry comes from their own repressions -- because they were stopped. </div>
<div id="t12_52" class="t s1_52">Suddenly they become anxious, an anxiety arises in them, because they have been taught </div>
<div id="t13_52" class="t s1_52">certain things, that this is bad. They were never allowed to touch their genital organs. </div>
<div id="t14_52" class="t s1_52">How can the child be allowed? They force the child, they punish the child, not to touch </div>
