<div id="t2_270" class="t s1_270">keep you unaware of yourself. Otherwise, nothing is wrong in the world. I'm not against the</div>

<div id="t5_270" class="t s1_270">significance.</div>
<div id="t6_270" class="t s1_270">Just think: twenty years before you had fallen in love with somebody. At that time you</div>
<div id="t7_270" class="t s1_270">were ready to do anything, and now it does not matter at all.</div>
<div id="t8_270" class="t s1_270">I had a friend who was in love with a Bengali girl. I have seen many lovers, but he was the</div>
<div id="t9_270" class="t s1_270">topmost. He was so much in love that he went to Bengal and lived in Bengal for two years to</div>
<div id="ta_270" class="t s1_270">learn the language and the actual Bengali accent. He used to dress like the Bengalis, talk like</div>
<div id="tb_270" class="t s1_270">the Bengalis ... but the girl was not interested. And after such an effort, when he proposed to</div>
<div id="tc_270" class="t s1_270">the girl she simply refused, saying, "I feel very repulsed by you." Naturally, it was too much.</div>
<div id="td_270" class="t s1_270">He was the son of a doctor. He went home, closed his room, and informed the house,</div>
<div id="te_270" class="t s1_270">"Don't try to open the door. I'm going to die inside my room."</div>
<div id="tf_270" class="t s1_270">He was the only son of his father, and the father asked, "But tell us what is the problem.</div>
<div id="tg_270" class="t s1_270">You wanted to go to Bengal for two years, and we arranged it. Now what is the problem?</div>
<div id="th_270" class="t s1_270">Where do you want to go? You can go ..."</div>
<div id="ti_270" class="t s1_270">He said, "I don't want to go anywhere. I wanted to marry a girl, and for her I went to</div>
<div id="tj_270" class="t s1_270">Bengal. Even with the Bengali accent, and Bengali clothes, she has refused me."</div>
<div id="tk_270" class="t s1_270">The girl used to live near my house, and just because she lived near my house, he had</div>
<div id="tl_270" class="t s1_270">become friendly towards me! It was the right place for him, because the girl used to come to</div>
<div id="tm_270" class="t s1_270">my house to sit in the garden, to read or to borrow some books from me. This was the right</div>
<div id="tn_270" class="t s1_270">place for him, and that's how I became aware of his existence.</div>
<div id="to_270" class="t s1_270">Everybody in the neighborhood tried hard to convince the doctor's son, "We will find a</div>

<div id="tq_270" class="t s1_270">everything, whatever ... If you want a Bengali girl, the whole of Bengal is there! We will find</div>
<div id="tr_270" class="t s1_270">a Bengali girl whatsoever it costs -- but don't do anything stupid." They were afraid he might</div>
<div id="ts_270" class="t s1_270">have taken poison from the father's dispensary or something and he might eat it or do</div>
<div id="tt_270" class="t s1_270">something stupid. But he would not speak, he was completely silent. Then they became very</div>
<div id="tu_270" class="t s1_270">much afraid, because they would knock and he would not answer.</div>
<div id="tv_270" class="t s1_270">The father came running to me and said, "He used to come to you, and perhaps you can</div>
<div id="tw_270" class="t s1_270">manage that at least he should speak. We are worried: perhaps he is unconscious or has fallen</div>
<div id="tx_270" class="t s1_270">in a coma or taken poison, and we are afraid because he has warned us, 'Don't try to open the</div>
<div id="ty_270" class="t s1_270">door, otherwise you will find my dead body inside.' So we cannot forcibly open the door, he</div>
<div id="tz_270" class="t s1_270">may do something ... we are at a loss."</div>
<div id="t10_270" class="t s1_270">I went there and I said, "There is no problem." I knocked on the door and said, "Arjun" --</div>
<div id="t11_270" class="t s1_270">his name was Arjun -- "do you want to commit suicide?"</div>
<div id="t12_270" class="t s1_270">He said, "Yes."</div>
<div id="t13_270" class="t s1_270">I said, "Then this is not the way. You come along with me and I will manage a beautiful</div>
<div id="t14_270" class="t s1_270">suicide for you!"</div>
<div id="t15_270" class="t s1_270">He said, "What?"</div>
<div id="t16_270" class="t s1_270">I said, "Open the door and just come into my car and I will arrange it, because I know the</div>
<div id="t17_270" class="t s1_270">right place to commit suicide."</div>
