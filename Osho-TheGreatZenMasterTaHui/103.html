<div id="t1_103" class="t s1_103">will absorb it without any complaint. You will simply say, "Such is my lot, such is my</div>
<div id="t2_103" class="t s1_103">destiny." You will not ask that it should have been otherwise. So why escape from the world?</div>
<div id="t3_103" class="t s1_103">Escaping means that you wanted a different kind of place, where you can be at ease. But you</div>
<div id="t4_103" class="t s1_103">can never be at ease anywhere.</div>
<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">I have heard about a man who had a very angry nature, and was very quick in reacting. He</div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">would not think for a single moment what he was doing, and he would repent it for his whole</div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s1_103">life. He became a nuisance in the whole town; he asked a monk who was visiting the town,</div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s1_103">"What should I do? Everybody seems to be boycotting me. I understand that I am</div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s1_103">temperamental, and I get angry very quickly. It comes with such force that I don't have any</div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s1_103">time to think about it, and I act according to my anger. Then I repent -- I should not have said</div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s1_103">that, I should not have done that. But now I have made the whole town my enemy."</div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s1_103">The monk said, "It is not your fault. This world never allows anybody to live peacefully,</div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s1_103">silently, prayerfully. One has to renounce it; it is a world full of sins and full of sinners. What</div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">do you think ... all the great religions' founders have renounced the world -- were they fools?</div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">Renounce this world! Come along with me!"</div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">The logic was clear. It is very easy to throw the responsibility on other people's shoulders:</div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">the world is wrong, you are perfectly right, but what can you do if the whole world is wrong</div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s1_103">and it drives you into wrong paths? And from everywhere the incentive is to do wrong.</div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">The monk convinced him, "Just come with me. I am going to the Himalayas. Live silently</div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s1_103">in a cave -- nobody will provoke you and the anger will disappear. How can you be angry</div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s1_103">when there is nobody else except you?" It was so convincing and so ego-fulfilling to think, "I</div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s1_103">was not wrong, the whole world is wrong." That's why all great religious teachers renounced</div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s1_103">it, went into seclusion, into isolation. If they could not cope with this world ..."I am a small</div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s1_103">man, how can I cope with it?"</div>
<div id="tp_103" class="t s1_103">So he renounced the world and went into the forest. Sitting under a tree he was feeling</div>
<div id="tq_103" class="t s1_103">very good, thinking that this is true: "Those who have renounced the world have known</div>
<div id="tr_103" class="t s1_103">eternal peace." And just at that moment a crow pissed over him. You can renounce the world,</div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s1_103">but there are monk crows who have also renounced the world and they live in the</div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s1_103">mountains ...</div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s1_103">Immediately he jumped up! He became very angry, forgot all about renunciation, and</div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">started throwing rocks at the crow. The master who had brought him came out of his cave,</div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">asking "What is the matter?"</div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">And he became angry at the master: "Yes, you are the matter! You have told me to</div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">renounce the world and there will be no anger. And I am sitting here silently, doing nothing,</div>
<div id="tz_103" class="t s1_103">no provocation from my side -- and a crow comes and pisses over me!"</div>
<div id="t10_103" class="t s1_103">The master who had brought him began to think that he had brought a very dangerous</div>
<div id="t11_103" class="t s1_103">fellow. He may get angry with him at any moment, for any reason. He said, "It is better ...</div>
<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">forgive me for suggesting to you the idea of renouncing. You go back to the world."</div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">The man said, "I cannot go back to the world. I have suffered there enough, and I have</div>
<div id="t14_103" class="t s1_103">suffered here. I am going to commit suicide!"</div>
<div id="t15_103" class="t s1_103">The master said, "It is up to you, but I am not suggesting it because I don't want to take the</div>
<div id="t16_103" class="t s1_103">responsibility." And the man left. Just near by there was a village and he collected wood for</div>
<div id="t17_103" class="t s1_103">his funeral pyre on the bank of the river.</div>
<div id="t18_103" class="t s1_103">Chapter 8 - Delusion</div>
<div id="t19_103" class="t s1_103">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1a_103" class="t s1_103">103</div>
