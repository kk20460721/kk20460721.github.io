<div id="t1_95" class="t s1_95">You are living in a sandcastle; but everything goes well -- unless somebody tells you </div>
<div id="t2_95" class="t s1_95">that this is a sandcastle. Once you have heard that this is a sandcastle, the problem </div>
<div id="t3_95" class="t s1_95">arises: you cannot live in it anymore, it is dangerous to live in it. And you cannot get </div>
<div id="t4_95" class="t s1_95">out of it because you have become so accustomed to it. Hence the confusion. Confusion </div>
<div id="t5_95" class="t s1_95">simply means you are unable to decide. </div>
<div id="t6_95" class="t s1_95">Unless you become decisive, Asang, the confusion will go on growing. My work </div>
<div id="t7_95" class="t s1_95">consists in creating confusion in you, because without creating confusion I cannot pull </div>
<div id="t8_95" class="t s1_95">you out of your sandcastles, I cannot pull you out of your paper boats, I cannot pull you </div>
<div id="t9_95" class="t s1_95">out of your lies and dreams. And I know perfectly well that when you have put so </div>
<div id="ta_95" class="t s1_95">much investment in a certain belief -- maybe you have lived for thirty years, forty years </div>
<div id="tb_95" class="t s1_95">in a certain belief -- to see now that it was wrong, that it was utterly stupid, that it was </div>
<div id="tc_95" class="t s1_95">ridiculous, creates a great problem for you. Your self-image of being intelligent is </div>
<div id="td_95" class="t s1_95">shattered. For forty years you have carried something ridiculous without seeing it. </div>
<div id="te_95" class="t s1_95">What kind of intelligence do you have? You become suspicious of your own intelligence </div>
<div id="tf_95" class="t s1_95">and that doesn't feel good. </div>
<div id="tg_95" class="t s1_95">That's why to be with a master needs courage. To be with a master needs the courage to </div>
<div id="th_95" class="t s1_95">accept that "I don't know." </div>
<div id="ti_95" class="t s1_95">The moment you accept, Asang, that "I don't know," all confusion will disappear, </div>
<div id="tj_95" class="t s1_95">evaporate, simply evaporate -- just as dewdrops evaporate in the early morning sun </div>
<div id="tk_95" class="t s1_95">leaving no trace behind them. The confusion is because you are clinging to a few things </div>
<div id="tl_95" class="t s1_95">which in the past you thought were very valuable. You thought that they were </div>
<div id="tm_95" class="t s1_95">ornaments, golden, studded with diamonds, and now I have made you aware that they </div>
<div id="tn_95" class="t s1_95">are nothing but chains -- maybe golden chains and maybe studded with diamonds, but </div>
<div id="to_95" class="t s1_95">what are diamonds? -- they are also stones. And what is gold? The difference exists only </div>
<div id="tp_95" class="t s1_95">in man's mind, otherwise gold and iron are the same. The evaluation is ours, the </div>
<div id="tq_95" class="t s1_95">projection is ours. But chains are chains and the chains have to be broken. Now the </div>
<div id="tr_95" class="t s1_95">things you have believed were ornaments, decorations, are being shown to you </div>
<div id="ts_95" class="t s1_95">persistently as nothing but chains. </div>
<div id="tt_95" class="t s1_95">Either you will have to escape from me... but remember, escaping won't help you. Once </div>
<div id="tu_95" class="t s1_95">you have been on my surgical table it is better to go through the whole operation! If you </div>
<div id="tv_95" class="t s1_95">escape in the middle of the operation you will remain confused your whole life, because </div>
<div id="tw_95" class="t s1_95">whatsoever you have understood from me is not going to leave you, it will haunt you. </div>
<div id="tx_95" class="t s1_95">So there is no escape from me. </div>
<div id="ty_95" class="t s1_95">Once you are with me you have to learn the ways of transformation, you have to go </div>
<div id="tz_95" class="t s1_95">through a radical change. You have to die to the past and be born anew. It is hard, it is </div>
<div id="t10_95" class="t s1_95">painful. Every birth is painful, and spiritual birth particularly is very painful. There are </div>
<div id="t11_95" class="t s1_95">no sedatives available. For spiritual birth one has to go through many pains, but those </div>
<div id="t12_95" class="t s1_95">pains are worth it because you grow out of your imprisonments; you grow into </div>
<div id="t13_95" class="t s1_95">freedom, you grow up. </div>
<div id="t14_95" class="t s1_95">And once you have tasted the joy of growing up, of becoming mature, then there is no </div>
<div id="t15_95" class="t s1_95">problem. Then you know that all that you have left behind was worthless, was rubbish. </div>
