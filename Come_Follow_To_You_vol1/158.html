<div id="t2_158" class="t s1_158">HAVE OFTEN HEARD YOU PRAISE THE POET. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? </div>
<div id="t3_158" class="t s1_158">The first thing: you cannot be identified as being a poet, because poetry is </div>
<div id="t4_158" class="t s1_158">something that happens only when you are not there. If you are there, it will just </div>
<div id="t5_158" class="t s1_158">be rubbish. It happens only when you are absent. </div>
<div id="t6_158" class="t s1_158">That's why it is so beautiful. It comes into your emptiness: it fills you -- your </div>
<div id="t7_158" class="t s1_158">vacuum. You become pregnant with the unknown, with the strange. </div>
<div id="t8_158" class="t s1_158">The poet is just a mother. The mother is not going to produce the child. The child </div>
<div id="t9_158" class="t s1_158">has been conceived: at the most the mother is tending it, caring for it deep within </div>
<div id="ta_158" class="t s1_158">her heart, trying to give it a body -- not the soul. </div>
<div id="tb_158" class="t s1_158">Poetry comes to you just like a child is conceived -- in deep love. In deep </div>
<div id="tc_158" class="t s1_158">receptivity you become a womb and the poetry is conceived. It is a pregnancy. </div>
<div id="td_158" class="t s1_158">And one has to be very careful because miscarriage is always possible: you can </div>
<div id="te_158" class="t s1_158">abort; you can be too much in a hurry and you can destroy it. </div>
<div id="tf_158" class="t s1_158">Allow it to settle within your being, It will take its own time; it will grow by and </div>
<div id="tg_158" class="t s1_158">by. It will grow in your unconscious. Your conscious is not needed; your </div>
<div id="th_158" class="t s1_158">conscious will be an interference. Forget about it, let it grow. </div>
<div id="ti_158" class="t s1_158">You will feel heavy -- your whole being will be as if you are carrying a burden. </div>
<div id="tj_158" class="t s1_158">Nice, pleasant, but still a burden. And then one day, the child is born. In that </div>
<div id="tk_158" class="t s1_158">moment, not only the child is born -- the mother is also born. </div>
<div id="tl_158" class="t s1_158">When the poetry is born, then the poet is born. It is not the poet who writes the </div>
<div id="tm_158" class="t s1_158">poetry. In fact, it is the birth of poetry which creates the poet. You were not a </div>
<div id="tn_158" class="t s1_158">poet before it -- only by its birth. </div>
<div id="to_158" class="t s1_158">A woman becomes a mother. A mother is a totally different category from the </div>
<div id="tp_158" class="t s1_158">ordinary woman. A woman is a woman -- a mother is totally different. She has </div>
<div id="tq_158" class="t s1_158">conceived something of the beyond; she has carried the beyond into her womb </div>
<div id="tr_158" class="t s1_158">and she has given it a body. </div>
<div id="ts_158" class="t s1_158">The poet is born when the poetry is born. It is a shadow of the poetry, a </div>
<div id="tt_158" class="t s1_158">consequence of the poetry. It succeeds poetry, it does not precede it. There was </div>
<div id="tu_158" class="t s1_158">no poet before, there was no mother before. There was a man, there was a </div>
<div id="tv_158" class="t s1_158">woman, but there was no poet, there was no mother. The mother comes into </div>
<div id="tw_158" class="t s1_158">existence after the poetry has happened. </div>
<div id="tx_158" class="t s1_158">But ordinarily, whatsoever you call poetry is not poetry. It is just a mind thing. </div>
<div id="ty_158" class="t s1_158">You think it; you write it. Whatsoever you write is prose and whatsoever God </div>
<div id="tz_158" class="t s1_158">writes through you is poetry. It may have the form of prose -- it doesn't matter. </div>
<div id="t10_158" class="t s1_158">Whatsoever Buddha says or Jesus says is poetry. The form is prose, that is not the </div>

<div id="t12_158" class="t s1_158">ocean tries to give you a message through the drop. </div>
<div id="t13_158" class="t s1_158">Whenever YOU write, it is prose -- ordinary prose. Whenever God writes </div>
<div id="t14_158" class="t s1_158">THROUGH you, it is poetry. It may be prose... it is still poetry. </div>
