<div id="t1_122" class="t s1_122">Albert Einstein's life was full of surprises. His greatest surprise was when he became</div>
<div id="t2_122" class="t s1_122">aware that if you are observing the behavior of electrons, they behave differently from when</div>
<div id="t3_122" class="t s1_122">nobody is observing them. Strange! We used to think that electrons were like dead people --</div>
<div id="t4_122" class="t s1_122">just matter -- but they seem to be very much alive, and very sensitive.</div>
<div id="t5_122" class="t s1_122">They don't belong to our society, they don't belong to our culture, they don't need to be</div>
<div id="t6_122" class="t s1_122">worried about what we think about them, but something happens ... when they are alone they</div>
<div id="t7_122" class="t s1_122">behave in one way and when they feel that somebody is watching, then they immediately</div>
<div id="t8_122" class="t s1_122">become gentlemen! Albert Einstein was so shocked, because it meant that electrons have</div>
<div id="t9_122" class="t s1_122">awareness of some kind. They are not just electric particles; they have their own</div>
<div id="ta_122" class="t s1_122">consciousness.</div>
<div id="tb_122" class="t s1_122">Perhaps you are not aware that when you pass by the side of a tree it changes its behavior.</div>
<div id="tc_122" class="t s1_122">It stands more erect, more beautiful, it releases more fragrance from the flowers. Somebody is</div>
<div id="td_122" class="t s1_122">coming by; it has to show itself as beautiful as possible.</div>
<div id="te_122" class="t s1_122">I was teaching in a university, and by the side of my department there was a long row of a</div>
<div id="tf_122" class="t s1_122">certain beautiful flower -- gulmohar. That flower is not found in cold countries; it is a flower</div>
<div id="tg_122" class="t s1_122">of very hot countries. And when it comes to blossom, then all the leaves disappear and only</div>
<div id="th_122" class="t s1_122">red flowers ... it seems as if the whole tree has become aflame, afire. It is a very beautiful</div>
<div id="ti_122" class="t s1_122">thing to see. The whole department was surrounded by gulmohar trees.</div>
<div id="tj_122" class="t s1_122">I used to park my car under one gulmohar tree, and it had become known to almost</div>
<div id="tk_122" class="t s1_122">everybody that that gulmohar tree had to be left for my car, because I had been parking my car</div>
<div id="tl_122" class="t s1_122">there for years. Even when I didn't go to the university, I used to send my car! The car was</div>
<div id="tm_122" class="t s1_122">parked -- everybody was satisfied that I was in the university. I had told my driver, "Just enjoy</div>
<div id="tn_122" class="t s1_122">the garden" -- the university has a beautiful garden -- "and after two, three hours, you take the</div>
<div id="to_122" class="t s1_122">car back, but first let the vice-chancellor see it." The vice-chancellor's office was just beside</div>
<div id="tp_122" class="t s1_122">the tree and he could see from his window that my car was standing there.</div>
<div id="tq_122" class="t s1_122">It was he who brought to my notice ... I had not been looking closely at the other trees, and</div>
<div id="tr_122" class="t s1_122">one day just as I was parking my car he came out of his office, and stopped me saying, "It is a</div>
<div id="ts_122" class="t s1_122">miracle! All the other gulmohar trees" -- and there were nearly fifty trees -- "have died for no</div>
<div id="tt_122" class="t s1_122">reason at all; perhaps some kind of epidemic has attacked those trees. Only your tree is still</div>
<div id="tu_122" class="t s1_122">alive, is still green, still blossoms. It must have something to do with you!"</div>
<div id="tv_122" class="t s1_122">I said, "It is strange ... I had never thought about it."</div>
<div id="tw_122" class="t s1_122">Seeing that other trees had died, I had enquired of the gardener, "What is the matter? Why</div>
<div id="tx_122" class="t s1_122">have all the trees died?"</div>
<div id="ty_122" class="t s1_122">He told me, "I cannot figure it out. Every care has been taken, but they simply go on</div>
<div id="tz_122" class="t s1_122">dying."</div>
<div id="t10_122" class="t s1_122">The trees were just standing naked, without leaves, without flowers. The vice-chancellor</div>
<div id="t11_122" class="t s1_122">jokingly said to me, "You must be doing something; only your tree is alive."</div>
<div id="t12_122" class="t s1_122">Two years after I left the university I went there again, and the first thing I did was to look</div>
<div id="t13_122" class="t s1_122">at my tree -- but it was gone! I was going to speak, so the vice-chancellor had come to receive</div>
<div id="t14_122" class="t s1_122">me. He said, "Look! I told you that you were doing something to that tree. It remained alive</div>
<div id="t15_122" class="t s1_122">for seven years when all the other trees were dying, but the day you left the university your</div>
<div id="t16_122" class="t s1_122">tree started dying. Within two months it was gone. We tried everything, but we could not save</div>
<div id="t17_122" class="t s1_122">it. And I used to love that tree," he said, "because it was just in front of my window."</div>
<div id="t18_122" class="t s1_122">Chapter 10 - Clinging</div>
