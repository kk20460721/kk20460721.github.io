<div id="t1_93" class="t s1_93">Love thy God with a]l thy heart, all thy mind, and all thy soul. The question was </div>
<div id="t2_93" class="t s1_93">about law, and the answer is about love. In fact, he has not answered the </div>
<div id="t3_93" class="t s1_93">question; or, you can say he has answered the question because this is the only </div>
<div id="t4_93" class="t s1_93">answer, there can be no other answer. </div>
<div id="t5_93" class="t s1_93">This has to be understood. Only from a higher plane can the question of a lower </div>
<div id="t6_93" class="t s1_93">plane be answered; remaining on the same plane, the answer is impossible. For </div>
<div id="t7_93" class="t s1_93">example, from where you are the question arises, many questions arise. If you </div>
<div id="t8_93" class="t s1_93">ask a person who remains on the same plane as you, he cannot answer you. His </div>
<div id="t9_93" class="t s1_93">answers may look relevant, but cannot be relevant, because he is also in the same </div>
<div id="ta_93" class="t s1_93">situation as you. </div>
<div id="tb_93" class="t s1_93">It is like a madman helping another madman, the blind leading the b]ind, a </div>
<div id="tc_93" class="t s1_93">confused man helping another confused man to attain to clarity. More </div>
<div id="td_93" class="t s1_93">muddledness, more confusion will happen out of it. That's what has happened in </div>
<div id="te_93" class="t s1_93">the world -- everybody is advising everybody else. Nothing is cheaper than </div>
<div id="tf_93" class="t s1_93">advice; in fact, it costs nothing -- just for the asking, and everybody is ready to </div>
<div id="tg_93" class="t s1_93">give you advice. Neither you think about it, nor those who are giving you advice, </div>
<div id="th_93" class="t s1_93">that they exist on the same plane, that their advice is simply useless; or, it can be </div>
<div id="ti_93" class="t s1_93">even harmful. Only somebody who is on a higher plane than you can be of any </div>
<div id="tj_93" class="t s1_93">help; one who has a clearer perception, a deeper clarity, a more crystallised being </div>
<div id="tk_93" class="t s1_93">-- only he can answer your questions. </div>
<div id="tl_93" class="t s1_93">I have heard -- it happened once: In a certain city in Tibet, wisdom was sold. A </div>
<div id="tm_93" class="t s1_93">man who wanted to become wise went to the marketplace. There were many </div>
<div id="tn_93" class="t s1_93">shops, and in every shop wisdom was sold. And it was plentiful; in fact so much </div>
<div id="to_93" class="t s1_93">so that it was very cheap. So he purchased thousands of wisdom bits. He came </div>
<div id="tp_93" class="t s1_93">home loaded with many bullock carts. He became wise. Then he used to visit his </div>
<div id="tq_93" class="t s1_93">friends to show the wisdom, because when you have it, you have to show it; </div>
<div id="tr_93" class="t s1_93">otherwise what is its use? A wisdom that is borrowed or purchased can have </div>
<div id="ts_93" class="t s1_93">only one function -- that of exhibition. It cannot be of any use to you; you can just </div>
<div id="tt_93" class="t s1_93">use it as a decoration. But those friends had also purchased from the same </div>
<div id="tu_93" class="t s1_93">market, and everybody was wise. In that town it was difficult to find a foolish </div>
<div id="tv_93" class="t s1_93">man, because all fools had purchased. They discussed, they argued; every day </div>
<div id="tw_93" class="t s1_93">they would meet and hurt each other by their arguments, and everybody would </div>
<div id="tx_93" class="t s1_93">try to prove that 'my' view was right. And nobody was ready to listen to </div>
<div id="ty_93" class="t s1_93">anybody. They created much confusion, much anger, much hostility. And they </div>
<div id="tz_93" class="t s1_93">enjoyed it -- that fiery exchange of hostility -- -they became addicted to it. </div>
<div id="t10_93" class="t s1_93">But this man, by and by, became fed up with the whole nonsense. He started </div>
<div id="t11_93" class="t s1_93">thinking, "I was better before I purchased these wisdom bits. My mind is more </div>
<div id="t12_93" class="t s1_93">burdened; I am more tense; I cannot sleep, with continuous arguments and </div>
<div id="t13_93" class="t s1_93">discussions leading nowhere, moving in vicious circles." So he went to a wise </div>
<div id="t14_93" class="t s1_93">man and asked what he should do. The wise man said, "It is natural. When </div>
<div id="t15_93" class="t s1_93">people exist on the same plane, they cannot help each other. They can only fight, </div>
<div id="t16_93" class="t s1_93">and they can only try to help each other; but they will basically cause harm. You </div>
