<div id="t1_68" class="t s1_68">CHAPTER 5. FREEDOM FROM THE ILLUSION OF KNOWLEDGE</div>
<div id="t2_68" class="t s2_68">He brought the box and put it down. He opened the lid of the box, put his hand inside, brought out</div>
<div id="t3_68" class="t s2_68">an empty hand and said to the king, ”Take this turban!” The king looked and said, ”I cannot see any</div>
<div id="t4_68" class="t s2_68">turban, your hand is empty.”</div>
<div id="t5_68" class="t s2_68">Immediately the man said, ”Let me remind you of one thing: the gods have said that only a person</div>
<div id="t6_68" class="t s2_68">who is born of his own father will be able to see the turban and the clothes. Now do you see the</div>
<div id="t7_68" class="t s2_68">turban?”</div>
<div id="t8_68" class="t s2_68">The king said, ”Of course I can see it!” There was no turban there, the man’s hand was empty – but</div>
<div id="t9_68" class="t s2_68">all the courtiers started clapping. They too could not see the turban, but they all started saying, ”We</div>
<div id="ta_68" class="t s2_68">have never seen such a beautiful turban. The turban is very beautiful, unique, wonderful! No man</div>
<div id="tb_68" class="t s2_68">has ever seen such a turban.”</div>
<div id="tc_68" class="t s2_68">When all the courtiers started saying that the turban was very beautiful, the king was in a difﬁcult</div>
<div id="td_68" class="t s2_68">situation. And then the man said, ”So now take off your turban and put this one on!”</div>
<div id="te_68" class="t s2_68">The king removed his own turban and put on the turban which did not exist. If it had been only a</div>
<div id="tf_68" class="t s2_68">turban that was involved, it would have been alright, but soon the king was really in trouble. First his</div>
<div id="tg_68" class="t s2_68">coat was removed, then his shirt, and ﬁnally the time came when he had to remove his last garment.</div>
<div id="th_68" class="t s2_68">The king was now naked but all the courtiers were shouting, ”Such beautiful clothes! Wonderful! We</div>
<div id="ti_68" class="t s2_68">have never seen such clothes!” Every courtier had to say it very loudly in case other people might</div>
<div id="tj_68" class="t s2_68">wonder if he was born of his own father or not.</div>
<div id="tk_68" class="t s2_68">And when the whole crowd was shouting about the clothes, each person thought that either</div>
<div id="tl_68" class="t s2_68">something is wrong with his eyes or until now he has been mistaken about his father.</div>
<div id="tm_68" class="t s2_68">If all the</div>
<div id="tn_68" class="t s2_68">other people are shouting about the clothes they must be right. So many people cannot be wrong;</div>
<div id="to_68" class="t s2_68">there is such a majority. When everyone says the same thing it must be right. This is democracy –</div>
<div id="tp_68" class="t s2_68">everybody is in agreement. When so many people agree they cannot all be wrong. So each person</div>
<div id="tq_68" class="t s2_68">thought that he alone was wrong and if he remained silent then people will think that he cannot see.</div>
<div id="tr_68" class="t s2_68">The king became afraid – should he take off the last article of clothing or not? On the one hand he</div>
<div id="ts_68" class="t s2_68">was afraid that the whole court would see him naked and on the other hand he was afraid that if the</div>
<div id="tt_68" class="t s2_68">world came to know that he was not born of his father then there would be many great difﬁculties –</div>
<div id="tu_68" class="t s2_68">perhaps it is better to be naked. It was a great problem – if he fell on one side there was a well, if</div>
<div id="tv_68" class="t s2_68">he fell on the other side there was a ditch. In the end it seemed better to accept nudity. At least his</div>
<div id="tw_68" class="t s2_68">father was saved, his dynasty was saved. He thought, ”The people will see me naked, what else! If</div>
<div id="tx_68" class="t s2_68">everybody is seeing the clothes, then maybe they really can see them and only I am in the wrong</div>
<div id="ty_68" class="t s2_68">– and this will create unnecessary complications.” So he dropped the last garment and stood there</div>
<div id="tz_68" class="t s2_68">naked.</div>
<div id="t10_68" class="t s2_68">Then the man said, ”O King! The clothes of gods have descended for the ﬁrst time on earth. You</div>
<div id="t11_68" class="t s2_68">should have a procession and travel around the city on a chariot.” The king became very afraid but</div>
<div id="t12_68" class="t s2_68">now there was no way out.</div>
<div id="t13_68" class="t s2_68">When man commits a mistake at the ﬁrst stage, then it becomes very difﬁcult to stop at any later</div>
<div id="t14_68" class="t s2_68">stage – and it becomes very difﬁcult to return. If one is not honest at the ﬁrst stage then one keeps</div>
<div id="t15_68" class="t s2_68">on getting more and more hypocritical at the next stages; it becomes difﬁcult for him to know where</div>
<div id="t16_68" class="t s2_68">to return from because each stage has become connected with many other stages.</div>
<div id="t17_68" class="t s2_68">The Inner Journey</div>
<div id="t18_68" class="t s2_68">68</div>
