<div id="t6_124" class="t s2_124">time, it is understood long after the poet’s death.</div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s2_124">Soren Kierkegaard wrote books. During his life-time, no one heard of them. he was able to publish</div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s2_124">only one book of which only ﬁve copies were sold and these too, were bought by his friends. he</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s2_124">lived all his life on the money his father left him for, for all the twenty four hours he was engrossed in</div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s2_124">his thoughts, in his search; where was the time to earn a living? Every ﬁrst of the month, he would</div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s2_124">go to the bank and draw some money on which he lived the entire month. Then one day he was told</div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s2_124">that the money has ﬁnished. Soren fell down at the door of the bank and died, because there was</div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s2_124">no hope of money coming from any other source.</div>
<div id="te_124" class="t s2_124">For a full hundred years, no one remembered Soren Kierkegaard. no one knew either his books or</div>
<div id="tf_124" class="t s2_124">even his name. Now since the last 30-40 years, he has been rediscovered. Today it can be said</div>
<div id="tg_124" class="t s2_124">that the West has been greatly inﬂuenced by Soren Kierkegaard. People say, it will take hundreds of</div>
<div id="th_124" class="t s2_124">years still, to understand Kierkegaard well. But in his life-time, people of his village laughed at him.</div>
<div id="ti_124" class="t s2_124">People used to deride him for wasting his time. They advised him to do some useful work and earn</div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s2_124">a living.</div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s2_124">The pictures that Vincent Van Gogh created. are now valued in millions but Vincent in his lifetime,</div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s2_124">could not sell a single one. If he took a cup of tea from a tea-shop, he gave a painting in return for he</div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s2_124">had no money. He would barter his paintings for a packet of cigarettes. Sixty years after his death</div>
<div id="tn_124" class="t s2_124">when his genius was discovered people delved in to their junk-yards to take out his paintings. Some</div>
<div id="to_124" class="t s2_124">paintings were recovered from a tea-shop, some from a hotel where he must have had a meal. All</div>
<div id="tp_124" class="t s2_124">these owners of his paintings became millionaires.</div>
<div id="tq_124" class="t s2_124">Each painting drew a sum of ﬁve lacs of rupees.</div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s2_124">Today only 200 of his paintings are available.</div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s2_124">Vincent Van Gogh was a painter of the highest calibre in the history of man. But it is now that he is</div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s2_124">acclaimed. In his life-time he went hungry three days in a week. His brother sent him money from</div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s2_124">which he ate four days in a week and spent the three days allowance to buy painting requisites. He</div>
<div id="tv_124" class="t s2_124">was on the verge of death by the time he was 32 for how long could he continue like this? So he</div>
<div id="tw_124" class="t s2_124">shot himself.</div>
<div id="tx_124" class="t s2_124">He wrote before he died that now it was no use living any more. He had created what he wanted to</div>
<div id="ty_124" class="t s2_124">create. His work was done, so why should he be a burden on his brother? He had to provide funds</div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s2_124">for his meals after all, and now that he had achieved what he was striving for since a year, his work</div>
<div id="t10_124" class="t s2_124">was done.</div>
<div id="t11_124" class="t s2_124">Now such people live on a different plane altogether. When the human race reaches that level, then</div>

<div id="t13_124" class="t s2_124">Soren Kierkegaard are not people who have reached the Rights of the Everest. They have attained</div>
