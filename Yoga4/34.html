<div id="t1_34" class="t s1_34">all the great artists, poets, painters, musicians. If a man can be hypnotized, that </div>
<div id="t2_34" class="t s1_34">shows that he is very sensitive. Just the contrary is the rumor: people think that </div>
<div id="t3_34" class="t s1_34">only a person who is a little stupid can be hypnotized. That is absolutely wrong. </div>
<div id="t4_34" class="t s1_34">It is almost impossible to hypnotize an idiot, because he won't listen, he won't </div>
<div id="t5_34" class="t s1_34">understand, and he will not be able to imagine. A very strong power of </div>
<div id="t6_34" class="t s1_34">imagination is needed. People think that only weak personalities can be </div>
<div id="t7_34" class="t s1_34">hypnotized. Absolutely wrong -- only very strong persons can be hypnotized. A </div>
<div id="t8_34" class="t s1_34">weak person is so loose that he has no integration in him, he has no center in </div>
<div id="t9_34" class="t s1_34">him. And unless you have a center of some sort, hypnosis cannot work because </div>
<div id="ta_34" class="t s1_34">from where will it work and spread through your being? And a weak person is </div>
<div id="tb_34" class="t s1_34">so uncertain about everything, so unconfident about himself, that he cannot be </div>
<div id="tc_34" class="t s1_34">hypnotized. Only people who have strong personalities can be hypnotized. </div>
<div id="td_34" class="t s1_34">I worked on many people and this is my finding: that a person who can be </div>
<div id="te_34" class="t s1_34">hypnotized can be de-hypnotized, and a person who cannot be hypnotized finds </div>
<div id="tf_34" class="t s1_34">it very difficult to move on the spiritual path, because the ladder goes both ways. </div>
<div id="tg_34" class="t s1_34">If you can be hypnotized easily, you can be de hypnotized easily. The ladder is </div>
<div id="th_34" class="t s1_34">the same. Whether you are hypnotized or de-hypnotized, you move on the same </div>
<div id="ti_34" class="t s1_34">ladder; only the directions differ. </div>
<div id="tj_34" class="t s1_34">I was working on one young man for many years. One day I hypnotized him and </div>
<div id="tk_34" class="t s1_34">gave him what hypnotists call a post hypnotic suggestion. I told him, 'Tomorrow, </div>
<div id="tl_34" class="t s1_34">exactly at this hour -- it was nine o'clock in the morning -- you will come to see </div>
<div id="tm_34" class="t s1_34">me. You will have to come to see me. There is no apparent reason for coming, but </div>
<div id="tn_34" class="t s1_34">at exactly nine o'clock you will have to come.' He was unconscious and I told </div>
<div id="to_34" class="t s1_34">him, 'When you come tomorrow at nine o'clock, exactly at nine, you will jump on </div>
<div id="tp_34" class="t s1_34">my bed and kiss the pillow, embrace the pillow as if the pillow is your beloved.' </div>
<div id="tq_34" class="t s1_34">Of course, the next day at a quarter to nine he arrived, but I was not sitting in my </div>
<div id="tr_34" class="t s1_34">bedroom, I was sitting on the veranda waiting for him. He came. I asked, 'Why </div>
<div id="ts_34" class="t s1_34">have you come?' He shrugged his shoulders. He said, 'Just by chance I was </div>
<div id="tt_34" class="t s1_34">passing and a thought came: why not come to you?' He was not aware that a </div>
<div id="tu_34" class="t s1_34">post hypnotic suggestion was working; he was finding a rationalization. He said, </div>
<div id="tv_34" class="t s1_34">'I was just passing through this road.' I asked him, 'Why were you passing </div>
<div id="tw_34" class="t s1_34">through this road? You never pass, and this is out of your way. Unless you want </div>
<div id="tx_34" class="t s1_34">to come to me, there is no point in going out of the town.' He said, 'Just for a </div>
<div id="ty_34" class="t s1_34">morning walk' -- a rationalization. He could not think that he had come without </div>
<div id="tz_34" class="t s1_34">any reason, otherwise it would be too much of a shattering experience to the ego. </div>
<div id="t10_34" class="t s1_34">'Are you mad?' he might think. But he was fidgety, uncomfortable. He was </div>
<div id="t11_34" class="t s1_34">looking all around not knowing why. He was looking for the pillow and the bed, </div>
<div id="t12_34" class="t s1_34">and the bed was not there. And knowingly, I was sitting outside. As minutes </div>
<div id="t13_34" class="t s1_34">passed, he became more and more restless. I asked him, 'Why are you so restless? </div>
<div id="t14_34" class="t s1_34">You cannot even sit properly. Why do you change position?' He said, 'Last night </div>
<div id="t15_34" class="t s1_34">I could not sleep well' -- a rationalization again. One has to somehow find </div>
<div id="t16_34" class="t s1_34">reasons, otherwise one will look mad. Then at just five minutes before nine he </div>
<div id="t17_34" class="t s1_34">said, 'It is too hot here.' It was not, because he had gone for a morning walk and </div>
