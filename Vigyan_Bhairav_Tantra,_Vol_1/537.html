<div id="t1_537" class="t s1_537">CHAPTER 38. TOWARD THE AUTHENTIC BEING</div>
<div id="t2_537" class="t s2_537">So if just by looking at the world as a psychodrama, as a drama, your intensity, your depth of living</div>
<div id="t3_537" class="t s2_537">is lost, then it is not worth preserving. It was false. Why is it lost? Because it was really an act in a</div>
<div id="t4_537" class="t s2_537">drama, and you were thinking that it was real so you felt it was deeper. Now you know it was just a</div>
<div id="t5_537" class="t s2_537">drama. If it was just a drama and the sincerity is lost, the sincerity was false. You were thinking it</div>
<div id="t6_537" class="t s2_537">was real, and it was not real. Just by looking at life as a drama, it disappeared.</div>
<div id="t7_537" class="t s2_537">It is just as if a rope was there lying in a dark room and you felt that it was a snake, but there was no</div>
<div id="t8_537" class="t s2_537">snake. Now you come with a lamp, and with the lamp the snake is lost and only the rope remains. If</div>
<div id="t9_537" class="t s2_537">with the lamp the snake is lost, then it was never there.</div>
<div id="ta_537" class="t s2_537">If you look at life as a drama, that which is false will be lost and that which is real will, for the ﬁrst time,</div>
<div id="tb_537" class="t s2_537">appear in you. Wait! Let the false be lost, and wait! There will be a gap, an interval, before the false</div>
<div id="tc_537" class="t s2_537">disappears and the real comes. There will be a gap. When false shadows will have disappeared</div>
<div id="td_537" class="t s2_537">completely and your eyes will not be ﬁlled by them, and your eyes will have become detached from</div>
<div id="te_537" class="t s2_537">the false shadows, you will be able to look at the real that was always there. But one has to wait.</div>
<div id="tf_537" class="t s2_537">”PLEASE SUGGEST WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION.” Nothing! Please don’t do anything. You</div>
<div id="tg_537" class="t s2_537">have created a mess because of too much of your doing.</div>
<div id="th_537" class="t s2_537">You are such a good doer, you have</div>
<div id="ti_537" class="t s2_537">confused everything around you – not only for yourself, but for others also. Be a non-doer; that will</div>
<div id="tj_537" class="t s2_537">be compassion towards yourself. Be compassionate. Don’t do anything, because with a false mind,</div>
<div id="tk_537" class="t s2_537">a confused mind, everything becomes more confused. With a confused mind, it is better to wait and</div>
<div id="tl_537" class="t s2_537">not to do anything so that the confusion disappears. It will disappear; nothing is permanent in this</div>
<div id="tm_537" class="t s2_537">world. You need only a deep patience. Don’t be in a hurry.</div>
<div id="tn_537" class="t s2_537">I will tell you one story. Buddha was traveling through a forest. The day was hot – it was just midday</div>
<div id="to_537" class="t s2_537">– he felt thirsty, so he said to his disciple Ananda, ”Go back. We crossed a little stream. You go back</div>
<div id="tp_537" class="t s2_537">and bring, fetch, some water for me.”</div>
<div id="tq_537" class="t s2_537">Ananda went back, but the stream was very small and some carts were passing through it. The</div>
<div id="tr_537" class="t s2_537">water was disturbed and had become dirty. All the dirt that had settled in it had come up, and the</div>
<div id="ts_537" class="t s2_537">water was not drinkable now. So Ananda thought, ”I shall have to go back.” He came back and he</div>
<div id="tt_537" class="t s2_537">said to Buddha, ”That water has become absolutely dirty and it is not drinkable. Allow me to go</div>
<div id="tu_537" class="t s2_537">ahead. I know there is a river just a few miles away from here. I will go and fetch water from there.”</div>
<div id="tv_537" class="t s2_537">Buddha said, ”No! You go back to the same stream.” As Buddha had said this Ananda had to follow</div>
<div id="tw_537" class="t s2_537">it, but he followed it with half a heart as he knew that the water would not be brought. And time was</div>
<div id="tx_537" class="t s2_537">being unnecessarily wasted and he was feeling thirsty, but when Buddha said it he had to go.</div>
<div id="ty_537" class="t s2_537">Again he came back and he said, ”Why did you insist? That water is not drinkable.”</div>
<div id="tz_537" class="t s2_537">Buddha said, ”You go again.” And as Buddha said it, Ananda had to follow.</div>
<div id="t10_537" class="t s2_537">The third time he reached the stream, the water was as clear as it had ever been. The dust had</div>
<div id="t11_537" class="t s2_537">ﬂowed away, the dead leaves had gone, and the water was pure again. Then Ananda laughed. He</div>
<div id="t12_537" class="t s2_537">brought the water and he came dancing. He fell at Buddha’s feet and he said, ”Your ways of teaching</div>
<div id="t13_537" class="t s2_537">are miraculous. You have taught me a great lesson – that just patience is needed and nothing is</div>
<div id="t14_537" class="t s2_537">permanent.”</div>
<div id="t15_537" class="t s2_537">Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t16_537" class="t s2_537">537</div>
<div id="t17_537" class="t s3_537">Osho</div>
