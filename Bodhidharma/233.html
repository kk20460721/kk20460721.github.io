<div id="t2_233" class="t s1_233">thousands of dollars ...and he got interested in the game. He risked all his </div>
<div id="t3_233" class="t s1_233">millions of dollars that he had earned in America -- just on one stake, not </div>
<div id="t4_233" class="t s1_233">gradually. </div>
<div id="t5_233" class="t s1_233">Even the owner of the casino was afraid. "What to do with this man? If he wins, </div>
<div id="t6_233" class="t s1_233">my whole casino is gone. A strange fellow!" He had been in the business for so </div>
<div id="t7_233" class="t s1_233">long but he had never seen a man putting millions of dollars at risk, at stake. </div>
<div id="t8_233" class="t s1_233">But there was no way to refuse; it was not possible to refuse. You have to accept </div>
<div id="t9_233" class="t s1_233">the stake and fortunately for the casino owner, the Japanese lost. He lost every </div>
<div id="ta_233" class="t s1_233">single dollar that he had earned and was hoping to live a retired life on. He had </div>
<div id="tb_233" class="t s1_233">nothing. </div>
<div id="tc_233" class="t s1_233">He went into his hotel and went to sleep. In the morning he saw in a newspaper </div>
<div id="td_233" class="t s1_233">that a Japanese had committed suicide by jumping from a forty-story building, </div>
<div id="te_233" class="t s1_233">and naturally it was thought that it must be the same Japanese who had lost </div>
<div id="tf_233" class="t s1_233">millions of dollars in the casino. So they mentioned that it seemed that it was the </div>
<div id="tg_233" class="t s1_233">same Japanese who had lost millions of dollars the previous night and he had not </div>
<div id="th_233" class="t s1_233">even a single dollar left for himself. </div>
<div id="ti_233" class="t s1_233">He read the news and he laughed and the owner of the hotel read the news and </div>
<div id="tj_233" class="t s1_233">he said, "He was in my hotel. How did he reach the other hotel? He was a </div>
<div id="tk_233" class="t s1_233">famous name." The Japanese rushed to his room and he was laughing so madly. </div>
<div id="tl_233" class="t s1_233">The owner asked, "Why are you laughing?" </div>
<div id="tm_233" class="t s1_233">He said, "I am laughing because I am alive and this newspaper said I have </div>
<div id="tn_233" class="t s1_233">committed suicide by jumping from a hotel. Some other Japanese has committed </div>
<div id="to_233" class="t s1_233">suicide." And it was a very logical conclusion by the journalist that it must be the </div>
<div id="tp_233" class="t s1_233">same famous Japanese actor from America. The body was so distorted, so broken </div>
<div id="tq_233" class="t s1_233">in pieces that there was no way to find out who the man was. </div>
<div id="tr_233" class="t s1_233">The owner of the hotel asked him, "It is strange. You lost all your life's earnings </div>
<div id="ts_233" class="t s1_233">and still you slept well?" He said, "It does not matter. I enjoyed the thrill for a </div>
<div id="tt_233" class="t s1_233">moment -- this way or that. And I enjoyed the owner of the casino trembling. As </div>
<div id="tu_233" class="t s1_233">far as money is concerned, I can go back and earn again. That is not a problem. It </div>
<div id="tv_233" class="t s1_233">was not stolen money, I earned it." </div>
<div id="tw_233" class="t s1_233">The owner said to him, "But you could have played the way all gamblers play -- </div>
<div id="tx_233" class="t s1_233">small sums. You could have played the whole night. Why did you stake </div>
<div id="ty_233" class="t s1_233">everything?" </div>
<div id="tz_233" class="t s1_233">And I was reading in his autobiography that he said, "I belong to the sudden </div>
<div id="t10_233" class="t s1_233">enlightenment school. I don't believe in gradual installments. If you have to do </div>
<div id="t11_233" class="t s1_233">something, do it totally and intensely. If you don't want to do it, then don't </div>
<div id="t12_233" class="t s1_233">unnecessarily befool yourself by doing it partially." </div>
<div id="t13_233" class="t s1_233">Bodhidharma is authentically a man of sudden enlightenment. But he was </div>

<div id="t15_233" class="t s1_233">China to help the growing religion there. The religion had grown like wildfire -- </div>
<div id="t16_233" class="t s1_233">just in six hundred years. It reached China at the time of Jesus Christ, five </div>
