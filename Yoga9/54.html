<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">they are your roots. </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">Sometime try a small experiment. Just naked, stand somewhere -- on the beach, near the </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">river, just naked in the sun -- and start jumping jogging, and feel your energies flowing </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">through your feet, through your legs to the earth. Jog and feel your energies going </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">through your legs into the earth. Then after a few minutes of jogging, just stand silently, </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">rooted to the earth, and just feel a communion of your feet with the earth. Suddenly you </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">will feel very, very rooted, grounded, solid. You will see the earth communicates, you </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">will see your feet communicate -- a dialogue arises between the earth and you. </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">This grounding has been lost. People have become uprooted; they are no longer </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">grounded. And then they cannot live. Because life belongs to the whole organism, not </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">only to the head. </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">They are doing a few eXperiments in a few scientific labs in the West where a few heads </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">have been kept alive. The head of a monkey is cut from the body, and the head is attached </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">to mechanical devices which function as the body. The head goes on thinking, dreaming. </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">The head is not affected by it, not at all. </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">This is what has happened. Not only in some labs in the West, it has happened to every </div>

<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">alive. That's why so many dreams, so much thinking, so much traffic in the head. People </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">come and say to me, "How to stop it?" The problem is not how to stop it. The problem is </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">how to disperse it into the whole body. Of course it is crowded too much because the </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">whole energy is there -- and it is not meant to carry that much energy, so you go crazy, </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">you go cuckoo. </div>

<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">dispersed, spread all over, well distributed -- insanity rarely happens. The more a society </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">becomes head-oriented, the more insanity. </div>

<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">will go berserk. The head needs small energy to function well. Too much energy in the </div>

<div id="t16_54" class="t s1_54">revolving in the head. Nowhere else have you moved, the whole territory of life has </div>
<div id="t17_54" class="t s1_54">remained untouched. </div>
