<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">God will be bored if </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">you become Christ. He wants somebody new, something original. He wants you, </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">and he wants you to be just yourself. </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">Question 6 </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">WHEN YOU TALK OF TAKING THE JUMP, I FEEL THAT I WANT TO TAKE </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">THE JUMP, BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT I AM NOT AT THE EDGE FROM WHICH </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">THE JUMP IS TAKEN. </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">I SEE YOU SHAKING US BUT CANNOT FEEL IT. </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">HOW DO I COME TO THE EDGE? </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">HOW CAN I LET YOU TEACH ME? </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">Everybody is always on the edge because each moment, if you dare, the jump is </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">possible. Each moment gives you the edge; and when you ask how to come to </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">the edge, you are being clever. Don't try to be clever. Your question is a trick so </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">you can console yourself that you are not a coward because the edge is not there, </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">so "from where to take the jump?" So first the edge has to be found -- and it will </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">never be found, because it is right in front of you. Wherever you are standing, </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">you are always at the sharp edge from where you can take the jump. And you </div>

<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">Just look in front of you. Just look. Wherever you are that doesn't matter. </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">And you say, "I see you shaking us but I cannot feel it." The problem is not that </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">you are asleep. If you are asleep, it is easy to shake you up out of your sleep. You </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">are pretending that you are asleep; then it becomes impossible. You can see that I </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">am shaking, but nothing is happening. How can you see if you are asleep? </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">Let me tell you one anecdote. It happened one summer afternoon. The father had </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">promised the children to go for a walk, and he didn't want it. For months he was </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">waiting for this day to rest, so he played, he pretended, that he is fast asleep: </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">The rather played possum while his youngsters tried their best to rouse him from </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">a Sunday-afternoon nap to take them for a promised walk, but in vain. They did </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">all sorts of things to wake him. They shook him, they shouted at him, but to no </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">avail. All efforts failed. They even became afraid, what has happened. And the </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">father was pretending to be asleep. Finally, his four-year-old daughter pried </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">open one of his eyelids, peered carefully, then reported, "He is still in there." </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">And I know you are also in there. </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">And you also know that you are pretending. </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">It is up to you. You can prolong the game as far as you like, because it is at your </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">cost. I am not worried by it. If you want to pretend, okay. Perfectly okay. Do it. </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">But I can see... I can see all of you pretending to be asleep -- afraid of getting up, </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">afraid of realizing your being, afraid to move. </div>
