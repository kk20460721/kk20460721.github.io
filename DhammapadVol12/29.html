<div id="t2_29" class="t s1_29">dreaming of other places. </div>
<div id="t3_29" class="t s1_29">The tourist goes on missing everything; he is in such a rush that he can't see anything. </div>
<div id="t4_29" class="t s1_29">To see things you have to be a little more relaxed, a little more restful. But the tourist is </div>
<div id="t5_29" class="t s1_29">always on the go. He will take his breakfast in New York, his lunch in London, and he </div>
<div id="t6_29" class="t s1_29">will suffer indigestion in Poona! </div>
<div id="t7_29" class="t s1_29">He carries a camera, inevitably, because he cannot see anything right now, so he goes </div>
<div id="t8_29" class="t s1_29">on taking photographs. Later on he makes albums -- he is a bum and makes albums! </div>
<div id="t9_29" class="t s1_29">And then later on, when it is all over, he looks at the Himalayan peaks, at the Goa beach </div>
<div id="ta_29" class="t s1_29">-- and when he was there he was not there! The camera was doing his work. He need </div>
<div id="tb_29" class="t s1_29">not be there; in fact, why does he bother at all? He can purchase these photographs </div>
<div id="tc_29" class="t s1_29">anywhere, better photographs than he can take because he is amateurish; professionals </div>
<div id="td_29" class="t s1_29">are already taking photographs. He can get beautiful albums and, sitting at home, he </div>
<div id="te_29" class="t s1_29">can look at them. But now the problem is that he cannot sit down. </div>
<div id="tf_29" class="t s1_29">It is one of the qualities that a few people are completely losing; they cannot sit. They </div>
<div id="tg_29" class="t s1_29">have to do something, they have to go somewhere, and they have to go fast. They don't </div>
<div id="th_29" class="t s1_29">want to lose any time -- and they are losing their whole lives in not losing time! They </div>
<div id="ti_29" class="t s1_29">will not appreciate anything because appreciation needs intimacy. </div>

<div id="tk_29" class="t s1_29">meditate, you have to allow the flower to have its say. You have to experience the joy, </div>

<div id="tn_29" class="t s1_29">the full moon. You have to see all the moods of the flower. You have to become </div>
<div id="to_29" class="t s1_29">acquainted, you have to create a friendship. You have to say "hello" to the flower; you </div>
<div id="tp_29" class="t s1_29">have to get into a dialogue, an existential dialogue. Only then can the flower reveal its </div>
<div id="tq_29" class="t s1_29">secrets to you. </div>
<div id="tr_29" class="t s1_29">But the tourist is pathological. Why is he rushing? -- for the simple reason that he does </div>

<div id="tt_29" class="t s1_29">just to sit silently. He does not know what to do with himself. He feels awkward, </div>
<div id="tu_29" class="t s1_29">embarrassed; he has to do something. </div>
<div id="tv_29" class="t s1_29">Man has become a doer. He has lost the quality of being a witness, a watcher. </div>

<div id="tx_29" class="t s1_29">sitting silently doing nothing, spring comes and the grass grows by itself. </div>
<div id="ty_29" class="t s1_29">Zen people sit for years doing nothing -- just sitting, watching... what is outside and </div>

<div id="t13_29" class="t s1_29">only when the TV takes them into some torture story, into some murder, into some </div>
<div id="t14_29" class="t s1_29">sexual orgy, into something so they can become participants. They are no more </div>
<div id="t15_29" class="t s1_29">spectators, they become identified with the characters. They start becoming part of the </div>
<div id="t16_29" class="t s1_29">story. </div>
<div id="t17_29" class="t s1_29">Now new dramas are being developed in the West in which the spectators can </div>
