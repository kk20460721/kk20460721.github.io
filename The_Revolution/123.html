<div id="t2_123" class="t s2_123">Don’t carry on the idea that a deaf person is always in silence. No, not at all; he knows nothing</div>
<div id="t3_123" class="t s2_123">of silence, he cannot know anything of silence. Don’t go on carrying the idea that the blind man</div>
<div id="t4_123" class="t s2_123">remains always in darkness. He cannot know anything of darkness, because to see darkness you</div>
<div id="t5_123" class="t s2_123">need eyes as much as you need eyes for light. Both are experiences of the eye – light and darkness.</div>
<div id="t6_123" class="t s2_123">The man who is blind cannot say anything about light, he cannot even say anything about darkness.</div>
<div id="t7_123" class="t s2_123">Have you ever been in the guru-disciple relationship? Only then will you be able understand it, what</div>
<div id="t8_123" class="t s2_123">it is. It is an experience, an incredible experience – but one has to go into it, into it totally. One has</div>
<div id="t9_123" class="t s2_123">to abandon oneself into it utterly, one has to be drunk, only then does the taste arise.</div>
<div id="ta_123" class="t s2_123">Now, Krishnamurti is against the masters. And the reason is that he was brought up by some very</div>
<div id="tb_123" class="t s2_123">authoritarian people.</div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s2_123">Not masters – teachers maybe, but not masters.</div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s2_123">He was brought up the</div>
<div id="te_123" class="t s2_123">theosophists and they were bent upon making a messiah out of him. They wanted to make a world</div>
<div id="tf_123" class="t s2_123">teacher, and they forced him into that pattern. Never before was a man so much tortured and forced</div>
<div id="tg_123" class="t s2_123">into a certain mound.</div>
<div id="th_123" class="t s2_123">Buddha’s messiah-hood was a natural growth of his own search. Christ became Christ on his own</div>
<div id="ti_123" class="t s2_123">accord. In fact just the opposite has been the case before – a Buddha has to ﬁght to declare that he</div>
<div id="tj_123" class="t s2_123">is the messiah. Nobody was willing to accept him; people were denying, people were rejecting, as</div>
<div id="tk_123" class="t s2_123">always. They cruciﬁed Jesus because he declared himself the Christ.</div>
<div id="tl_123" class="t s2_123">It happened in just the opposite order with Krishnamurti. He had no idea what it means to be a</div>
<div id="tm_123" class="t s2_123">Christ or a Buddha. And these foolish theosophists, Leadbeater and Annie Besant and the lot, they</div>
<div id="tn_123" class="t s2_123">were all trying to make a messiah out of him, they were after manufacturing a messiah. They really</div>
<div id="to_123" class="t s2_123">disciplined him so much – everything was watched, he was never allowed any freedom, he was</div>
<div id="tp_123" class="t s2_123">constantly accompanied. They decided what clothes he should wear and when he should go to bed</div>
<div id="tq_123" class="t s2_123">and when he should get out of bed and what prayers to do – early in the morning, three o’clock, a</div>
<div id="tr_123" class="t s2_123">small child...</div>
<div id="ts_123" class="t s2_123">They caught hold of him when he was only nine and they started torturing the child. Not only that,</div>
<div id="tt_123" class="t s2_123">they even forced him to write books. THEY were writing those books. Krishnamurti does not even</div>
<div id="tu_123" class="t s2_123">remember when he wrote the book, the famous book, AT THE FEET OF THE MASTER. He does</div>
<div id="tv_123" class="t s2_123">not remember having written it at all. Just a nine-year-old child, how could he write that book? But</div>
<div id="tw_123" class="t s2_123">these people wanted to prove that he was a born messiah, that he had come from the other world.</div>
<div id="tx_123" class="t s2_123">They forced a book in his name.</div>
<div id="ty_123" class="t s2_123">And instructions were coming from the high quarters, from masters who roam in the sky, spirits –</div>
<div id="tz_123" class="t s2_123">Master K H and others – and letters were arriving. And these people were making those letters too;</div>
<div id="t10_123" class="t s2_123">never before in the whole history of religion has such a forgery been done. They did it to impress</div>
<div id="t11_123" class="t s2_123">this small child – they did tricks, they managed strategies.</div>
<div id="t12_123" class="t s2_123">Krishnamurti would be sitting with closed eyes and a letter would drop from the roof. Now, a nine-</div>
<div id="t13_123" class="t s2_123">year-old child naturally trusts and believes.</div>
<div id="t14_123" class="t s2_123">And somebody would be hiding on the roof – those</div>
<div id="t15_123" class="t s2_123">people were even caught and brought to the court. And the letters were written and those letters</div>
<div id="t16_123" class="t s2_123">would fall in his lap, and he was being instructed from on high.</div>
<div id="t17_123" class="t s2_123">Just think of the abnormal situation in which he was brought up. He was not allowed to move with</div>
<div id="t18_123" class="t s2_123">any woman, or if he was allowed he was allowed to move only with very aged women with whom he</div>
