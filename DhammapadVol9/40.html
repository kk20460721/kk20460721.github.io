<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">But even Dhanapalaka with such might, with such wisdom, goes wild when he is in rut; </div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s1_40">when he is sexually aroused he is no more in his senses, he becomes mad. </div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s1_40">Sex is really an internal process of intoxicating you. It is chemical. You have nothing to </div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s1_40">do with it. It is your body chemistry, it is your physiology that releases certain </div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s1_40">chemicals in your body and then in a sexual state you can do something for which you </div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s1_40">will repent. Later on you will say, "I cannot believe how it happened. It happened in </div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s1_40">spite of me." And it is not only sex; so many things are happening in you through your </div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s1_40">physiology. When you are angry, it is not you. Again certain poisons are released in </div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s1_40">your blood and you are under the impact of those poisons. </div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s1_40">Buddha says: If you start watching the processes of sexuality, anger, greed, you will be </div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s1_40">able to see that it is not out of you that these things are born. You are only a witness. </div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s1_40">These things are born in your body, in your mind; and body and mind are not two </div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s1_40">things, they are one. You are psychosomatic. The mind is your inner body, and the body </div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s1_40">is your outer mind. Hence the body affects the mind and the mind affects the body. You </div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s1_40">are a third force. </div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s1_40">That third force is known only through meditation; there is no other way to know it, </div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s1_40">because it is through meditation that you become disidentified with the bodymind </div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s1_40">mechanism. Otherwise you can be very mighty, very knowledgeable, even sometimes </div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s1_40">in some moments very wise, but all that can go in a second. Your body can possess you, </div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s1_40">your physiology can become so powerful over you that you become a slave. You lose </div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s1_40">your mastery. Whenever you are angry, whenever you are in a sexual arousal, you are </div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s1_40">no more a master, you are simply a slave. </div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s1_40">Buddha is not against sex, remember. Buddha is not against anger or greed, he is </div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s1_40">against slavery. And anything that creates slavery in you, he would like you to </div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s1_40">transcend it. Remember the difference. There are people who are against sex -- they are </div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s1_40">against sex because sex is hedonistic, they say; they are against sex because sex makes </div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s1_40">you happy. They are against happiness. They can't tolerate any happiness anywhere. </div>
<div id="ts_40" class="t s1_40">They are sadists, they would like the whole world to be in suffering; they enjoy </div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s1_40">suffering. They not only want others to suffer, they make themselves suffer too. </div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s1_40">Suffering is their joy. That is a perverted state, a pathological state. </div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s1_40">Buddha is not against sex because it gives you pleasure; he is simply trying to make you </div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s1_40">aware of the fact that these are the things that keep you tethered into a kind of inner </div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s1_40">slavery. You are a slave of your own chemistry, you are a slave of your own physiology </div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s1_40">-- and this slavery has to be transcended. </div>

<div id="t12_40" class="t s1_40">elephant grove, he thinks of female elephants. His whole mind is possessed by fantasy -</div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s1_40">- and that's true about you too. Whenever you are under the impact of any chemical </div>
