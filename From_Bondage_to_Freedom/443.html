<div id="t1_443" class="t s1_443">CHAPTER 38. ENOUGH JUST TO BE WITH ME</div>
<div id="t2_443" class="t s2_443">But there are people who are blind; they have eyes but they cannot see.</div>
<div id="t3_443" class="t s2_443">They are deaf; they</div>
<div id="t4_443" class="t s2_443">have ears but they cannot hear. Even sometimes by accident they may get into the family of the</div>
<div id="t5_443" class="t s2_443">enlightened one, but they still remain an outsider, they never merge with it. And it has been always</div>
<div id="t6_443" class="t s2_443">so.</div>
<div id="t7_443" class="t s2_443">In Gautam Buddha’s time, how many people were in his family, how many of those people became</div>
<div id="t8_443" class="t s2_443">enlightened? How many people dropped out of his family – how many people even became enemies</div>
<div id="t9_443" class="t s2_443">of Gautam Buddha? How many attempts were made to kill him by his own ex-followers? Buddha’s</div>
<div id="ta_443" class="t s2_443">own cousin-brother tried to kill him many times. He could not succeed, but he made those efforts.</div>
<div id="tb_443" class="t s2_443">So the statement is true, but not for all. It is true only for those who have a sensitivity to feel the</div>
<div id="tc_443" class="t s2_443">presence of the enlightened one, to be soaked in his silence, to be ﬁlled with his fragrance, to let</div>
<div id="td_443" class="t s2_443">their heart beat in the same rhythm, to become part of his song, his dance. How many people have</div>
<div id="te_443" class="t s2_443">eyes to see?</div>
<div id="tf_443" class="t s2_443">The birth of a buddha is very rare – that’s why the statement that it is very fortunate to be born in</div>
<div id="tg_443" class="t s2_443">the times of an enlightened one. It is more fortunate to hear about him, because millions will not</div>
<div id="th_443" class="t s2_443">even know that he had existed, that he was here, that the river was just ﬂowing by their side and</div>
<div id="ti_443" class="t s2_443">they remained thirsty. Millions will see the body of the enlightened one, but will not be able to see</div>
<div id="tj_443" class="t s2_443">his spiritual aura, his energy ﬁeld.</div>
<div id="tk_443" class="t s2_443">Millions will hear about him, but will not believe. Millions will hear him, but will not listen. And there</div>
<div id="tl_443" class="t s2_443">will be many who, on trivial excuses, will leave the enlightened one’s family, not knowing what they</div>
<div id="tm_443" class="t s2_443">are leaving, not knowing that their excuses are just meaningless.</div>
<div id="tn_443" class="t s2_443">And many will try even to destroy the man, because somehow his presence is against their egos.</div>
<div id="to_443" class="t s2_443">His presence makes them feel to melt with him, to become one with him, and there are egoistic</div>
<div id="tp_443" class="t s2_443">people – hard, they don’t have hearts – who cannot melt. For them it is better to destroy this person,</div>
<div id="tq_443" class="t s2_443">because he is a constant reminder of their dead heart.</div>
<div id="tr_443" class="t s2_443">But there will always be a few who will remain with the enlightened one in every situation. Nothing</div>
<div id="ts_443" class="t s2_443">matters more than to be with him. But one needs a little sensitivity, and then all stupid things become</div>
<div id="tt_443" class="t s2_443">meaningless. It is certainly a great blessing.</div>
<div id="tu_443" class="t s2_443">I am reminded of one of my vice-chancellors.</div>
<div id="tv_443" class="t s2_443">He was a world-famous historian.</div>
<div id="tw_443" class="t s2_443">He had been</div>
<div id="tx_443" class="t s2_443">a professor of history in Oxford for almost twenty years, and after his retirement from Oxford, he</div>
<div id="ty_443" class="t s2_443">came back to India. He had a world-famous name, and he was elected to be the vice-chancellor</div>
<div id="tz_443" class="t s2_443">of the university I was studying in.</div>
<div id="t10_443" class="t s2_443">He was a nice man, a beautiful personality, with immense</div>
<div id="t11_443" class="t s2_443">knowledgeability, scholarship, recognition – so many books to his credit.</div>
<div id="t12_443" class="t s2_443">By chance, the day he took charge as vice-chancellor was Gautam Buddha’s birthday. And Gautam</div>
<div id="t13_443" class="t s2_443">Buddha’s birthday is more important than anybody else’s birthday, because Gautam Buddha’s</div>
<div id="t14_443" class="t s2_443">birthday is also his day of enlightenment, and also his day of leaving the body.</div>
<div id="t15_443" class="t s2_443">The same day</div>
<div id="t16_443" class="t s2_443">he was born, the same day he became enlightened, the same day he died.</div>
<div id="t17_443" class="t s2_443">The whole university gathered to hear him speak on Gautam Buddha. And he was a great historian,</div>
<div id="t18_443" class="t s2_443">he had written about Gautam Buddha; and he spoke with great emotion. Tears in his eyes, he said,</div>
<div id="t19_443" class="t s2_443">”I have always felt that if I had been born in Gautam Buddha’s time, I would have never left his feet.”</div>
<div id="t1a_443" class="t s2_443">From Bondage to Freedom</div>
<div id="t1b_443" class="t s2_443">443</div>
<div id="t1c_443" class="t s3_443">Osho</div>
