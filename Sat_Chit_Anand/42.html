<div id="t1_42" class="t s1_42">CHAPTER 4. YOU CAN BE SHOWERED BY FLOWERS OF BLISS</div>
<div id="t2_42" class="t s2_42">Subhash was well known for not being in agreement with Mahatma Gandhi, although he was in</div>
<div id="t3_42" class="t s2_42">the same party.</div>
<div id="t4_42" class="t s2_42">There was only one party which was ﬁghting for the freedom of the country, so</div>
<div id="t5_42" class="t s2_42">all freedom lovers were in the party.</div>
<div id="t6_42" class="t s2_42">And Subhash stood as a candidate to be the president of</div>
<div id="t7_42" class="t s2_42">Congress, and immediately Mahatma Gandhi’s phoniness was revealed.</div>
<div id="t8_42" class="t s2_42">On the one hand he was teaching that you have to love your enemy, and then seeing that Subhash,</div>
<div id="t9_42" class="t s2_42">if he became the president of Congress, would be dangerous to his philosophy and to his leadership,</div>
<div id="ta_42" class="t s2_42">he became a totally different kind of man. Subhash did not believe in hypocrisy, and there was a</div>
<div id="tb_42" class="t s2_42">possibility of his winning. The only man who could defeat him was Mahatma Gandhi himself, but</div>
<div id="tc_42" class="t s2_42">that would bring him down, very much down, from his great saintliness.</div>
<div id="td_42" class="t s2_42">So what he did was this: he supported a certain man, Doctor Pattabhi Sitaramayya, as his candidate.</div>
<div id="te_42" class="t s2_42">And he thought that because he was declaring him as his candidate, the doctor would certainly win.</div>
<div id="tf_42" class="t s2_42">But Subhash was very much loved by young people, by the young blood, and this fellow, Doctor</div>
<div id="tg_42" class="t s2_42">Pattabhi, was absolutely unknown. He was an obedient follower of Mahatma Gandhi, so he would</div>
<div id="th_42" class="t s2_42">serve him, but he was not known to the country.</div>
<div id="ti_42" class="t s2_42">And Subhash was almost a lion: he fought and, unbelievably he won. Gandhi did not participate in</div>
<div id="tj_42" class="t s2_42">the gathering where he was going to be declared the president. He forgot all his philosophy.</div>
<div id="tk_42" class="t s2_42">In fact, Subhash proved to be a far greater man. Seeing that Gandhi was trying to create a split in</div>
<div id="tl_42" class="t s2_42">the Congress – which would be a split in the movement for the liberation of the country – he resigned</div>
<div id="tm_42" class="t s2_42">from the presidency, just so that the movement would remain one. He sacriﬁced himself completely;</div>
<div id="tn_42" class="t s2_42">so as not to get into a ﬁght, he moved out of the country.</div>
<div id="to_42" class="t s2_42">He showed this sincerity from the very beginning. He was educated in England, belonged to a very</div>
<div id="tp_42" class="t s2_42">rich family of Bengal, was going to be one of the top bureaucrats. He was trained for the Indian</div>
<div id="tq_42" class="t s2_42">civil service in Britain, as were all top bureaucrats, most of whom were English. Very rarely was</div>
<div id="tr_42" class="t s2_42">an Indian chosen – not more than one percent.</div>
<div id="ts_42" class="t s2_42">Otherwise on some small excuse, Indians were</div>
<div id="tt_42" class="t s2_42">rejected.</div>
<div id="tu_42" class="t s2_42">Shree Aurobindo was rejected and you will not believe on what grounds. He had come ﬁrst in every</div>
<div id="tv_42" class="t s2_42">subject, he was one of the geniuses of this century. Only in horse riding could he not succeed. But</div>
<div id="tw_42" class="t s2_42">what has horse riding to do with being a top ofﬁcer? This was a strategy: he was a scholar and he</div>
<div id="tx_42" class="t s2_42">became world famous, but he was rejected.</div>
<div id="ty_42" class="t s2_42">Every method was tried to reject Indians.</div>
<div id="tz_42" class="t s2_42">Subhash they could not manage to reject.</div>
<div id="t10_42" class="t s2_42">All their</div>
<div id="t11_42" class="t s2_42">strategies he managed to overcome, so very reluctantly Britain accepted Subhash for their ICS.</div>
<div id="t12_42" class="t s2_42">One thing more remained, which was a formality: every ICS ofﬁcer had to appear for a personal</div>
<div id="t13_42" class="t s2_42">interview before the governor-general. It was just a formality once you had passed the examination.</div>
<div id="t14_42" class="t s2_42">Subhash entered into the ofﬁce of the governor-general.</div>
<div id="t15_42" class="t s2_42">Bengalis always carry an umbrella – one never knows why. Whether it is raining or not, whether it is</div>
<div id="t16_42" class="t s2_42">hot or not; it may be winter and there is no need; they may have to carry it by their side, but they will</div>
<div id="t17_42" class="t s2_42">carry it. An umbrella is absolutely necessary for a Bengali. If you see anybody carrying an umbrella,</div>
<div id="t18_42" class="t s2_42">you understand: he is a Bengali. Now, there is no need to carry an umbrella into the ofﬁce of the</div>
<div id="t19_42" class="t s2_42">viceroy; at least you should leave it outside. But Bengalis will not leave their umbrellas.</div>
<div id="t1a_42" class="t s2_42">Sat Chit Anand</div>
<div id="t1b_42" class="t s2_42">42</div>
<div id="t1c_42" class="t s3_42">Osho</div>
