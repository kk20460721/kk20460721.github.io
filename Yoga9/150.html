<div id="t1_150" class="t s1_150">Mulla Nasrudin's wife was very worried about her husband's heavy drinking and one </div>
<div id="t2_150" class="t s1_150">night she decided to give him a fright. She draped herself in a white sheet and went down </div>
<div id="t3_150" class="t s1_150">to the local cemetery, knowing that her husband was in the habit of taking a shortcut </div>
<div id="t4_150" class="t s1_150">through it on his way home from the pub. It was not long before he came staggering </div>
<div id="t5_150" class="t s1_150">along, and out she jumped from behind a headstone. </div>
<div id="t6_150" class="t s1_150">"Ooooooo!" she screamed, "I am the Devil!" </div>
<div id="t7_150" class="t s1_150">Mulla Nasrudin stuck out his hand, "Put it there, pal," he said. "I am married to your </div>
<div id="t8_150" class="t s1_150">sister." </div>
<div id="t9_150" class="t s1_150">Recognize! These ghosts of Nehru and Dinkar and J. P., recognize them. Your past has </div>
<div id="ta_150" class="t s1_150">been married to their sister: politics. Don't be deceived by these ghosts. They have left a </div>
<div id="tb_150" class="t s1_150">mark; it has to be washed clean. </div>
<div id="tc_150" class="t s1_150">And I know it is very difficult. It is very difficult when you were just on the point of </div>
<div id="td_150" class="t s1_150">succeeding and suddenly you turned and changed your path. When he met me he was an </div>
<div id="te_150" class="t s1_150">MP, but that accident changed his life. By and by he drifted away, became more and </div>
<div id="tf_150" class="t s1_150">more interested in me and less and less interested in his political career. And he was just </div>
<div id="tg_150" class="t s1_150">on the point of success. If he had succeeded -- and suffered the pains of success -- and the </div>
<div id="th_150" class="t s1_150">failure of success -- then it would have been easier for him to drop the old ghosts. He was </div>
<div id="ti_150" class="t s1_150">just at the point of succeeding. Just at the gate when he was entering the palace, he met </div>
<div id="tj_150" class="t s1_150">me. Now the gate and the dream of the palace and the dream of living there continues. </div>
<div id="tk_150" class="t s1_150">It would have been easier if he had lived in the palace a little while and had known that </div>
<div id="tl_150" class="t s1_150">there is nothing in it; then it would have been much easier. That's why I say if you arc in </div>
<div id="tm_150" class="t s1_150">some career, it is better to succeed in it and then renounce. If you want to become </div>
<div id="tn_150" class="t s1_150">wealthy, become wealthy. Be finished with this. Once wealth is there, you will come to </div>
<div id="to_150" class="t s1_150">know it is frustrating, it is nothing. But if you leave it before you have succceded, then </div>
<div id="tp_150" class="t s1_150">there will be a problem. Many times the idea will again and again arise: "Maybe there </div>
<div id="tq_150" class="t s1_150">was something. Otherwise why is the whole world interested in wealth and politics and </div>
<div id="tr_150" class="t s1_150">power? There may be something. Maybe I missed the train. I should have continued; I </div>
<div id="ts_150" class="t s1_150">should have seen, experienced the whole thing." </div>
<div id="tt_150" class="t s1_150">If you have succeeded in a certain desire, the desire itself makes you desireless. The </div>
<div id="tu_150" class="t s1_150">success kills the desire automatically. Then even with less awareness one can renounce. </div>
<div id="tv_150" class="t s1_150">But if you renounce something when you were just reaching, touching, and everything </div>
<div id="tw_150" class="t s1_150">was possible and you turn away, more intense awareness will be needed. So Maitreya </div>
<div id="tx_150" class="t s1_150">will need a more intense awareness. </div>
<div id="ty_150" class="t s1_150">But that too was to happen, because once you come in contact with certain influences </div>
<div id="tz_150" class="t s1_150">which take you out of the world, once you come in contact -- and you come in contact </div>
<div id="t10_150" class="t s1_150">unawares</div>
<div id="t11_150" class="t s1_150">....</div>
<div id="t12_150" class="t s1_150">I was a guest at another politician's house and he had invited Maitreya also. So because </div>
<div id="t13_150" class="t s1_150">an old politician, a senior politician, had invited him, he must have come by the way, just </div>
<div id="t14_150" class="t s1_150">to see what the matter was. But once you come in contact with some influence that can </div>
<div id="t15_150" class="t s1_150">take you out of the world of ambition -- and if you are a little sensitive and understanding </div>
<div id="t16_150" class="t s1_150">-- and he is -- he understood the point immediately</div>
<div id="t17_150" class="t s1_150">....</div>
<div id="t18_150" class="t s1_150">That old politician with whom I </div>
<div id="t19_150" class="t s1_150">was staying remained with me for many years but never understood me. Now he is gone </div>
<div id="t1a_150" class="t s1_150">and dead, but he died a politician and he died a member of Parliament. He was one of the </div>
