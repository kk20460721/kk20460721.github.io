<div id="t1_47" class="t s1_47">So he became a SADHU, he became a monk, he renounced the world. He said he had </div>
<div id="t2_47" class="t s1_47">renounced the world, the wife and all. And he had to find a rationalization for his nose, </div>
<div id="t3_47" class="t s1_47">so he said, "This is the latest technique of attaining, of realizing God. The moment you </div>
<div id="t4_47" class="t s1_47">cut off your nose... it is the nose that is the barrier!" And he philosophized about the </div>
<div id="t5_47" class="t s1_47">nose and he said, "The nose represents the ego." And it is right -- the nose represents the </div>
<div id="t6_47" class="t s1_47">ego. You can see the ego on the nose; nowhere else it is so apparent! </div>
<div id="t7_47" class="t s1_47">So he convinced a few people. And the method seemed so simple -- just cutting off the </div>
<div id="t8_47" class="t s1_47">nose and you get the ultimate truth and the bliss -- and he used to look so blissful. He </div>
<div id="t9_47" class="t s1_47">pretended, but what else to do? -- without a nose he had to save face somehow! And </div>
<div id="ta_47" class="t s1_47">without a nose it is difficult, but he laughed, danced, and he was always ecstatic. </div>
<div id="tb_47" class="t s1_47">A few foolish people became ready to cut off their noses, so he would take one person </div>
<div id="tc_47" class="t s1_47">into the forest, cut off his nose, and would ask him, "Can you see God?" </div>
<div id="td_47" class="t s1_47">The man would say, "I can't see anything, and my nose is gone." </div>
<div id="te_47" class="t s1_47">And the man would say, "Neither can I see, but now it is better that you don't tell </div>
<div id="tf_47" class="t s1_47">anyone, because your nose is gone just the same way as mine is gone. Be part of the </div>
<div id="tg_47" class="t s1_47">conspiracy now. "Tell others... become ecstatic and tell others that you have attained to </div>
<div id="th_47" class="t s1_47">God." </div>
<div id="ti_47" class="t s1_47">What else was there to do now? The nose couldn't be put back; in those days there was </div>
<div id="tj_47" class="t s1_47">no plastic surgery possible. This seemed to be the only rational way. So the man would </div>
<div id="tk_47" class="t s1_47">go dancing in the town and would tell others, "That man is the greatest master -- I have </div>
<div id="tl_47" class="t s1_47">seen God. What an experience! I am so blissful and the bliss goes on showering on me! </div>
<div id="tm_47" class="t s1_47">Twenty-four hours I am ecstatic and God is with me." And he would talk of great </div>
<div id="tn_47" class="t s1_47">things. And Indians are very much capable of talking of great things; for centuries they </div>
<div id="to_47" class="t s1_47">have talked and talked and talked. </div>
<div id="tp_47" class="t s1_47">A few more people became interested, and slowly slowly he had a gathering. The more </div>
<div id="tq_47" class="t s1_47">people were with him without noses, the more his theory was gaining ground. Even the </div>
<div id="tr_47" class="t s1_47">king became interested: "If there is such a simple method" -- almost like Transcendental </div>
<div id="ts_47" class="t s1_47">Meditation! -- "Why not try?" But the prime minister was a little doubtful, skeptical. He </div>
<div id="tt_47" class="t s1_47">said, "You wait, don't be in a hurry. Let me first inquire." </div>
<div id="tu_47" class="t s1_47">So he got hold of this man, gave him a good beating, and told him, "Tell the truth, </div>
<div id="tv_47" class="t s1_47">otherwise we will kill you!" </div>
<div id="tw_47" class="t s1_47">So he had to tell the truth: "It is because my wife had cut off my nose, and what else </div>
<div id="tx_47" class="t s1_47">could I do? I had to find some way to save my face, and this seemed to be the most </div>
<div id="ty_47" class="t s1_47">simple, attractive way. And I am perfectly happy now: I have a following, my needs are </div>
<div id="tz_47" class="t s1_47">taken care of, and you will be surprised -- even my wife who knows perfectly well that </div>
<div id="t10_47" class="t s1_47">she had cut off my nose, she has come to see me the other day and asked me, 'What is </div>
<div id="t11_47" class="t s1_47">the matter?' And I said, 'Although you had cut off my nose... but the moment my nose </div>
<div id="t12_47" class="t s1_47">dropped I saw God!' And she is contemplating becoming a follower and I am just </div>
<div id="t13_47" class="t s1_47">waiting for her. I want to cut off her nose! Let me cut off her nose, then you can kill me </div>
<div id="t14_47" class="t s1_47">or whatsoever you want to do to me. Let me take revenge first!" </div>
<div id="t15_47" class="t s1_47">And what a spiritual way to take revenge! </div>
