<div id="t2_10" class="t s2_10">less restlessness, but we do not know peace. We know more hatred, we know less hatred. We</div>
<div id="t3_10" class="t s2_10">know more anger, we know less anger</div>
<div id="t4_10" class="t s2_10">....</div>
<div id="t5_10" class="t s2_10">You may think that anger only happens sometimes. This idea is false. You are angry for twenty-four</div>
<div id="t6_10" class="t s2_10">hours. Sometimes it is more, sometimes it is less, but you are angry for twenty-four hours. With just</div>
<div id="t7_10" class="t s2_10">a little opportunity the anger will start surfacing. It is in search of an opportunity. The anger is ready</div>
<div id="t8_10" class="t s2_10">inside; it is only in search of an opportunity on the outside to to give you an excuse to be angry. If</div>
<div id="t9_10" class="t s2_10">you become angry without an excuse then people will think you are mad. But if opportunities are</div>
<div id="ta_10" class="t s2_10">not given to you, you will start becoming angry even without any reason. Perhaps you do not know</div>
<div id="tb_10" class="t s2_10">this.</div>
<div id="tc_10" class="t s2_10">For example, a person can be locked in a room provided with every facility and asked to note</div>
<div id="td_10" class="t s2_10">down any changes which happen to his mind. When he notes them down, he will ﬁnd that without</div>
<div id="te_10" class="t s2_10">any reason sometimes he feels good in that closed room, sometimes he feels bad; sometimes he</div>
<div id="tf_10" class="t s2_10">becomes sad, sometimes he becomes happy; sometimes he feels angry, sometimes he does not</div>
<div id="tg_10" class="t s2_10">feel angry. There are no excuses there, the situation in the room is constantly the same – but what</div>
<div id="th_10" class="t s2_10">is happening to him? That is why man is so afraid of aloneness – because in aloneness there are</div>
<div id="ti_10" class="t s2_10">no excuses from the outside. One will have to assume all the things are within oneself. Any person</div>
<div id="tj_10" class="t s2_10">kept in isolation cannot remain healthy for more than six months, he will become mad.</div>
<div id="tk_10" class="t s2_10">A fakir told an Egyptian emperor about this but the emperor did not believe him so the fakir asked</div>
<div id="tl_10" class="t s2_10">him to ﬁnd the most healthy person in his city and to put him in isolation for six months. The city</div>
<div id="tm_10" class="t s2_10">was searched. A healthy, young man, who was happy in every way – was just married, had a child,</div>
<div id="tn_10" class="t s2_10">was earning well, was very happy – was brought to the emperor. The emperor told him, ”We will not</div>
<div id="to_10" class="t s2_10">give you any trouble. We are just making an experiment. Your family will be taken care of – food,</div>
<div id="tp_10" class="t s2_10">clothing, and every arrangement will be made for them. It will be a better situation for them than it</div>
<div id="tq_10" class="t s2_10">will be for you. You will have all comforts but for six months you will have to live alone.”</div>
<div id="tr_10" class="t s2_10">He was locked up in a big house. He was given every facility – but it was so lonely! Even the man</div>
<div id="ts_10" class="t s2_10">who was guarding did not know his language so they could not speak to each other. Within only two</div>
<div id="tt_10" class="t s2_10">or three days the man started becoming nervous. He had every comfort, there were no hardships</div>
<div id="tu_10" class="t s2_10">whatsoever: at the right time food was available, at the right time he could go to sleep. Because</div>
<div id="tv_10" class="t s2_10">it was a royal palace, every facility was available and there were no difﬁculties whatsoever. Sitting</div>
<div id="tw_10" class="t s2_10">there he could do whatsoever he wanted to do. The only thing was that he could not talk to anybody,</div>
<div id="tx_10" class="t s2_10">he could not meet anybody. Within just two or three days the uneasiness began and after eight days</div>
<div id="ty_10" class="t s2_10">he started shouting, ”Take me out of here! I don’t want to stay here!”</div>
<div id="tz_10" class="t s2_10">What was the problem? The problems had started coming from within. The problems that, until</div>
<div id="t10_10" class="t s2_10">yesterday, he had thought were coming from the outside, he now found, in his aloneness, were</div>
<div id="t11_10" class="t s2_10">coming from the inside. Within six months the man became mad. After six months, when he was</div>
<div id="t12_10" class="t s2_10">taken out, he had gone completely mad. He had started talking to himself. He had started cursing</div>
<div id="t13_10" class="t s2_10">himself. He had started getting angry with himself. He had started loving himself. Now the other</div>
<div id="t14_10" class="t s2_10">was not present. After six months he was taken out as a mad man. It took six years for him to get</div>
<div id="t15_10" class="t s2_10">cured.</div>
<div id="t16_10" class="t s2_10">Any one of you would become mad. Other people give you opportunities hence you do not become</div>
<div id="t17_10" class="t s2_10">mad.</div>
<div id="t18_10" class="t s2_10">You ﬁnd an excuse: ”This man has abused me, therefore I am ﬁlled with anger.” Nobody</div>
