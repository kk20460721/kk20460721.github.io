<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">Natural breathing has to be understood. Watch small children, they breathe naturally. </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">That's why small children are so full of energy. The parents are tired, but they are not </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">tired. </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">One child was saying to another child, "I am so full of energy that I wear out my shoes </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">within seven days." Another said, "That's nothing. I am so full of energy I wear out my </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">clothes within three days." </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">The third said, "That too is nothing. I am so full of energy I wear out my parents within </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">one hour." </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">In America they have done an experiment where one very powerful man, with an athletic </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">body, with tremendous energy, was told to follow a small child and imitate him. </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">Whatsoever the child was going to do, this athlete had to do, just imitate for eight hours. </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">Within four hours the athlete was gone, flat on the floor, because the child enjoyed it very </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">much and he started doing many things -- jumping, jogging, shouting, yelling. And the </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">athlete had to just repeat. The child was perfectly full of energy after four hours. The </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">athlete -was gone; he said, "He will kill me. Eight hours! Finished! I cannot do anything </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">more." He was a great boxer, but boxing is one thing. You cannot compete with a child. </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">From where does the energy come? It comes from pranamaya kosha. A child breathes </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">naturally, and of course breathes more prana in, more chi in, and accumulates it in his </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">belly. The belly is the accumulating place, the reservoir. Watch a child; that is the right </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">way to breathe. When a child breathes, his chest is completely unaffected. His belly goes </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">up and down. He breathes as if from the belly. All children have a little belly; that belly is </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">there because of their breathing and the reservoir of energy. </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">That is the right way to breathe; remember not to use your chest too much. Sometimes it </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">can be used -- in emergency periods. You are running to save your life; then the chest can </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">be used. It is an emergency device. Then you can use shallow, fast breathing, and run. </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">But ordinarily the chest should not be used. And one thing to be remembered: the chest is </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">meant only for emergency situations because it is difficult in an emergency situation to </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">breathe naturally, because if you breathe naturally you remain so calm and quiet you </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">cannot run, you cannot fight. You are so calm and collected you are Buddhalike. And in </div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">an emergency -- the house is on fire -- if you breathe naturally you will not be able to </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">save anything. Or a tiger jumps upon you in a forest and if you go on breathing naturally </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">you will not be bothered; you will say, "Okay, let him do whatsoever he wants." You will </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">not be able to protect yourself. </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">So nature has given an emergency device; the chest is an emergency device. When a tiger </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">attacks you, you have to drop natural breathing and you have to breathe from the chest. </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">Then you will have more capacity to run, to fight, to burn energy fast. And in an </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">emergency situation there are only two alternatives -- flight or fight. Both need a very </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">shallow but intense energy -- shallow, but a very disturbed, tense state. </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">Now if you continuously breathe from the chest, you will have tensions in your mind. If </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">you continuously breathe from the chest, you will always be afraid. Because the chest </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">breathing is meant to be only in fearful situations. And if you have made it a habit then </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">you will be continuously afraid, tense, always in flight. The enemy is not there, but you </div>
<div id="t17_4" class="t s1_4">will imagine the enemy is there. That's how paranoia is created. </div>
<div id="t18_4" class="t s1_4">In the West also a few people have come across this phenomenon -- Alexander Lowen or </div>
<div id="t19_4" class="t s1_4">other bioenergetic people who have been working on bioenergy. That is prana. They have </div>
<div id="t1a_4" class="t s1_4">come to feel that people who are afraid, their chest is tense and they are breathing very </div>
