<div id="t1_259" class="t s1_259">The guest said, "That is not a problem. I will keep completely silent." And then they</div>
<div id="t2_259" class="t s1_259">started. It was still dark and when they reached the peak of the mountain, the sun was rising.</div>
<div id="t3_259" class="t s1_259">The birds started chirping, the trees started coming out of their sleep ... flowers all around,</div>
<div id="t4_259" class="t s1_259">wild flowers opened their petals and their fragrance. The man forgot that he was not supposed</div>
<div id="t5_259" class="t s1_259">to speak -- and he did not think that this was much speech. He simply said, "How beautiful."</div>
<div id="t6_259" class="t s1_259">Lao Tzu looked at his old colleague and friend with such stern eyes ... When they were</div>
<div id="t7_259" class="t s1_259">back home he told his friend, "Please don't bring your guest again tomorrow because he is too</div>
<div id="t8_259" class="t s1_259">talkative" -- and in two hours he had said only two words, "How beautiful"!</div>
<div id="t9_259" class="t s1_259">Lao Tzu said to his friend, "I was present, he was present, you were present, the sun was</div>
<div id="ta_259" class="t s1_259">present, the songs of the birds were present, the fragrance of flowers was present -- there is no</div>
<div id="tb_259" class="t s1_259">need to say anything. I was also aware ... I am not saying that it was not beautiful; I am saying</div>
<div id="tc_259" class="t s1_259">that by saying it is beautiful, you have reduced its multidimensional beauty into two ordinary</div>
<div id="td_259" class="t s1_259">words. You have made knowing into knowledge."</div>
<div id="te_259" class="t s1_259">The difference is very subtle. Knowing is a living, flowing experience, still vibrating in</div>
<div id="tf_259" class="t s1_259">your heart. Knowledge is of the past -- it may be just one minute past. Knowledge is part of</div>
<div id="tg_259" class="t s1_259">the memory; knowing is part of awareness.</div>
<div id="th_259" class="t s1_259">So when he says, SINCE KNOWLEDGE IS RIGHT NOW, he really means, since</div>
<div id="ti_259" class="t s1_259">knowing is right now -- because knowledge can never be right now. If right now you don't go</div>
<div id="tj_259" class="t s1_259">another moment, but do away with your knowledge right where you are, then you will join</div>
<div id="tk_259" class="t s1_259">hands and walk along together with the patriarchs, with the buddhas, with the awakened ones.</div>
<div id="tl_259" class="t s1_259">It is the most immediate approach to existence. You don't have to pray to God, you don't</div>
<div id="tm_259" class="t s1_259">have to believe in a messiah, you don't have to have faith in a holy book, you don't have to go</div>
<div id="tn_259" class="t s1_259">through tortuous disciplines. You have just to be this very moment alert, awake. Then,</div>
<div id="to_259" class="t s1_259">whatever is happening around you, you listen to it, but you don't make it a knowledge. You</div>
<div id="tp_259" class="t s1_259">don't say, "The birds are singing" -- you listen to the song. You relish the song, you absorb it</div>
<div id="tq_259" class="t s1_259">into your being, but you don't reduce it into words.</div>
<div id="tr_259" class="t s1_259">If this becomes your way of life, your very style of existence, then any moment --</div>
<div id="ts_259" class="t s1_259">whenever you will be absolutely attuned, your totality present here and now -- the explosion is</div>
<div id="tt_259" class="t s1_259">going to happen. Look at the beautiful trees, but don't say they are beautiful. Is not looking</div>
<div id="tu_259" class="t s1_259">enough? Is it necessary to bring language in? Can't you enjoy the beauties around you directly,</div>
<div id="tv_259" class="t s1_259">without any language? Just try it.</div>
<div id="tw_259" class="t s1_259">You have thousands of opportunities every day. Even in the fast hubbub of a marketplace,</div>
<div id="tx_259" class="t s1_259">to be alert, without making any judgment ... it is one of the most wonderful experiences that</div>
<div id="ty_259" class="t s1_259">even the noises in the marketplace don't disturb you. On the contrary, they seem to have a</div>
<div id="tz_259" class="t s1_259">beauty of their own, a life of their own.</div>
<div id="t10_259" class="t s1_259">Whether you are sitting or working, chopping wood or carrying water from a well, just be</div>
<div id="t11_259" class="t s1_259">alert to everything that is going on around you, without reducing it to knowledge. If you can</div>
<div id="t12_259" class="t s1_259">avoid words and knowledge, which are like dust in your eyes ... they don't allow you to see</div>
<div id="t13_259" class="t s1_259">that which is. And that which is, is the only authentic name for God. It is not a goal</div>
<div id="t14_259" class="t s1_259">somewhere else; it is always available, just you are not available to it.</div>
<div id="t15_259" class="t s1_259">So the whole process of dhyan, chan, or Zen, is simply to make you available to the</div>
<div id="t16_259" class="t s1_259">existence which is always available to you. Just a meeting, an introduction with the reality in</div>
<div id="t17_259" class="t s1_259">which you are existing -- so simple and so obvious -- and you will not be able to find even</div>
<div id="t18_259" class="t s1_259">traces of all your miseries and afflictions and agonies. They were nightmares, and you were</div>
<div id="t19_259" class="t s1_259">Chapter 21 - Understanding</div>
<div id="t1a_259" class="t s1_259">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
