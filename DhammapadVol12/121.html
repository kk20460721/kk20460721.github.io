<div id="t7_121" class="t s1_121">And that's exactly what happened: many people became enlightened after Buddha </div>

<div id="tb_121" class="t s1_121">nothing worth seeing outside. So we closed our eyes. </div>

<div id="tp_121" class="t s1_121">Meera, essentially there are no differences at all. Essentially there cannot be any </div>

<div id="tx_121" class="t s1_121">very money-minded. When you don't have a home, when you don't have a country, </div>
<div id="ty_121" class="t s1_121">then all your security becomes focused on money; then it is only money that can save </div>
