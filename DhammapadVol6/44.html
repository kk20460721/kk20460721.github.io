<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">But the danger is... and the danger is great; the behaviorists have become aware of it. </div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">They have been experimenting with rats. They had made a small machine, electrodes </div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">fixed in the head of the rats, and the rats were taught if they want a sexual orgasm they </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">have to push a button. Those rats went berserk! They pushed the buttons so many times </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">-- sixty thousand times one rat did it! He continued; he would not eat, he would not </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">drink, he forgot everything, until he fell dead. He was so tired, but the joy was such... he </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">risked all! </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">The eyes don't have sexuality, neither do the sexual organs have it; it is somewhere in </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">the mind. </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">I have heard an ancient parable: </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">It seems that when the creator was making the world, he called man aside and </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">bestowed upon him twenty years of normal sex life. Man was horrified: "Only twenty </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">years?" But the creator did not budge. That was all he would give him. </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">Then he called the monkey and gave him twenty years. </div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">"But I don't need twenty years," the monkey protested. "Ten is plenty!" </div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">Man spoke up and said, "Can I have the other ten years?" </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">The monkey graciously agreed. </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">Then he called the lion and gave him twenty years. The lion too needed only ten. Again </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">man said, "Can I have the other ten years?" </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">The lion roared, "Of course." </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">Then came the donkey. He was given twenty years, but like the others, ten years was </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">enough for him. Man asked for the spare ten years and got them. </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">This explains why man has twenty years of normal sex life, ten years monkeying </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">around, ten years of lion about it, and ten years of making an ass of himself. </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">Man seems to be the most stupid animal out of all of these. They say, "Ten is more than </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">enough." Man seems to be the most in the grip of desire: more and more</div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">....</div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">Whatsoever </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">he has is not enough, is never enough. This creates his sorrow, this makes him a slave. </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">The "more" is your master. To be aware of the trap that is created by this constant desire </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">for more is to take a very necessary step towards self-mastery. </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">"Something the matter?" asked the bartender of the young, well-dressed customer who </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">sat staring sullenly into his drink. </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">"Two months ago my grandfather died and left me eighty-five thousand dollars," said </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">the man. </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">"That does not sound like anything to be upset about," said the bartender, polishing a </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">glass. "It should happen to me!" </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">"Yeah," said the sour young man, "but last month an uncle on my mother's side passed </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">away. He left me hundred and fifty thousand dollars." </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">"So why are you sitting there looking so unhappy?" asked the bartender. </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">"So far this month, not a cent!" </div>
