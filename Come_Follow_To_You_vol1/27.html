<div id="t6_27" class="t s1_27">It happened once:A woman purchased a parrot, but by the time she reached </div>
<div id="t7_27" class="t s1_27">home she was very much puzzled, worried. She had paid a good price for it; the </div>

<div id="t9_27" class="t s1_27">once in a while the parrot would say loudly, "I am a very wicked woman." This </div>
<div id="ta_27" class="t s1_27">was something! </div>
<div id="tb_27" class="t s1_27">The woman lived alone. And she was a very religious woman -- otherwise why </div>

<div id="td_27" class="t s1_27">again -- and even passers-by would hear and listen -- and the parrot would say, </div>
<div id="te_27" class="t s1_27">"I am a very, very wicked woman." </div>
<div id="tf_27" class="t s1_27">She went to the vicar because he was the only source of her wisdom and </div>
<div id="tg_27" class="t s1_27">knowledge and information. She said, "This is very bad, and I am puzzled about </div>
<div id="th_27" class="t s1_27">what to do. The parrot is beautiful and everything is good except this." </div>
<div id="ti_27" class="t s1_27">The vicar said, "Don`t be worried. I have two very religious parrots. Look!" -- one </div>
<div id="tj_27" class="t s1_27">was in his cage tolling the bell and another was praying in his cage. Very </div>
<div id="tk_27" class="t s1_27">religious people -- "You bring your parrot. Good company always helps. Leave </div>
<div id="tl_27" class="t s1_27">your parrot for a few days here with these religious people, and later on you can </div>
<div id="tm_27" class="t s1_27">take your parrot back." </div>
<div id="tn_27" class="t s1_27">The woman liked the idea. She agreed brought the parrot, and the vicar </div>
<div id="to_27" class="t s1_27">introduced the parrot to his parrots. But before he could say anything, the parrot </div>
<div id="tp_27" class="t s1_27">said, "I am a very, very wicked woman." </div>
<div id="tq_27" class="t s1_27">The vicar was also nonplussed </div>
<div id="tr_27" class="t s1_27">-- what to do? In that moment the parrot who </div>
<div id="ts_27" class="t s1_27">was praying stopped praying and said to the other parrot, "You fool! Stop tolling </div>
<div id="tt_27" class="t s1_27">the bell, our prayers are fulfilled." They were praying for a woman! "Stop tolling </div>
<div id="tu_27" class="t s1_27">the bell; the prayer is answered!". </div>
<div id="tv_27" class="t s1_27">In fact whenever you see somebody praying, suspect something has gone wrong. </div>
<div id="tw_27" class="t s1_27">They are praying for a woman, praying for money; praying for something, </div>
<div id="tx_27" class="t s1_27">praying for happiness. A really happy person does not pray. Happiness is his </div>
<div id="ty_27" class="t s1_27">prayer, and there cannot be a higher or a greater prayer than just to be happy. </div>
<div id="tz_27" class="t s1_27">A happy person does not know anything about god, does not know anything </div>

<div id="t11_27" class="t s1_27">Be happy and you will be religious: happiness is the goal. </div>
