<div id="t1_68" class="t s1_68">You will be surprised to know that your education is against intelligence. Society needs </div>
<div id="t2_68" class="t s1_68">imitators. It wants you to be good in memorizing, not in becoming intelligent. It wants </div>
<div id="t3_68" class="t s1_68">you to become good machines, not beautiful people; efficient machines, but machines </div>
<div id="t4_68" class="t s1_68">all the same. It needs you to function well, but it does not want you to be more </div>
<div id="t5_68" class="t s1_68">conscious. Then you would start saying no to many things; you will not be so obedient. </div>
<div id="t6_68" class="t s1_68">The society wants yea-sayers. It wants blind people. It does not want you to see because </div>
<div id="t7_68" class="t s1_68">if you see you are bound to be affected by your seeing, you are bound to change your </div>
<div id="t8_68" class="t s1_68">ways. The society wants blind followers. </div>
<div id="t9_68" class="t s1_68">Hence it is very rare that a person becomes awakened because -- the first thing -- to </div>
<div id="ta_68" class="t s1_68">become awakened, to be a buddha, means to go away from the collective mind; to </div>
<div id="tb_68" class="t s1_68">become so much an individual, integrated, that even if the whole world is against you </div>
<div id="tc_68" class="t s1_68">you don't care. You have decided that you will live according to your inner voice. </div>
<div id="td_68" class="t s1_68">That is the first step, but a great step, a quantum leap. It is moving into danger, it is </div>
<div id="te_68" class="t s1_68">risky. You will be creating enemies. And you will be going into a world which is </div>
<div id="tf_68" class="t s1_68">uncharted, a territory of which you know nothing. No maps exist; no maps can exist, in </div>
<div id="tg_68" class="t s1_68">the very nature of things. </div>
<div id="th_68" class="t s1_68">Hence it is very rare to find the awakened master. In hundreds of years it happens only </div>
<div id="ti_68" class="t s1_68">once that there is a man like Jesus or Buddha or Lao Tzu. There are thousands of </div>
<div id="tj_68" class="t s1_68">pretenders and they are easily available and they are very cheap. In fact, even if you </div>
<div id="tk_68" class="t s1_68">don't find them, they will find you. They are constantly searching for followers. Their </div>
<div id="tl_68" class="t s1_68">whole business depends on how many followers they have. Each religion is concerned </div>
<div id="tm_68" class="t s1_68">in having more followers because more followers mean more power. </div>

<div id="tp_68" class="t s1_68">have been alerted that, "This man is dangerous. And the danger is more so," says the </div>

<div id="tr_68" class="t s1_68">beautiful way that Christians may get hooked by him." </div>
<div id="ts_68" class="t s1_68">I am sitting here. I have never been to Germany and I will never be there. What is the </div>
<div id="tt_68" class="t s1_68">fear? </div>
<div id="tu_68" class="t s1_68">A small commission was made to study all of my books to prepare the report. The </div>
<div id="tv_68" class="t s1_68">commission seems to be a little bit confused. It seems a few people of the commission </div>
<div id="tw_68" class="t s1_68">have become interested... because if you have a little bit of intelligence, even just a little </div>
<div id="tx_68" class="t s1_68">bit of intelligence, how can you avoid seeing that there is something? So they say, </div>
<div id="ty_68" class="t s1_68">"There is something, there seems to be something. And it happens to be very much like </div>
<div id="tz_68" class="t s1_68">Jesus' teaching. But beware. Jesus has said, 'False prophets will be coming who will </div>
<div id="t10_68" class="t s1_68">speak like me.' But Jesus is the only begotten Son of God." </div>

<div id="t12_68" class="t s1_68">reduced, its power lost. So no crowd wants anybody to leave its fold. It will create all </div>
<div id="t13_68" class="t s1_68">kinds of hindrances. And if you want to become enlightened you have to pass all those </div>
