<div id="t1_161" class="t s1_161">money! It is not even his! What kind of karma is he committing? Touching one's </div>
<div id="t2_161" class="t s1_161">own money is bad and touching somebody else's money -- that must be worse." I </div>
<div id="t3_161" class="t s1_161">said, "Think of this poor man also. If it is your money, whether you touch it or </div>
<div id="t4_161" class="t s1_161">not ...or you can purchase rubber gloves. Make it simple so you can touch the </div>
<div id="t5_161" class="t s1_161">money but still you are not touching it." </div>
<div id="t6_161" class="t s1_161">But that will not make somebody a saint. If somebody is wearing rubber gloves </div>
<div id="t7_161" class="t s1_161">and having all kinds of money with him, you will not call him a saint. This </div>
<div id="t8_161" class="t s1_161">seemed to be very cunning man ...but having another person is not very different </div>
<div id="t9_161" class="t s1_161">either. </div>
<div id="ta_161" class="t s1_161">So there are people who are silent, but inside they are boiling. They want to </div>
<div id="tb_161" class="t s1_161">speak and they find ways of speaking by making gestures, which is a very </div>
<div id="tc_161" class="t s1_161">difficult thing because they become absolutely dependent, almost slaves, on the </div>
<div id="td_161" class="t s1_161">person who interprets for them. And it is up to him how he interprets. They </div>
<div id="te_161" class="t s1_161">cannot even prevent, they cannot even say, "You are not right." They have to </div>
<div id="tf_161" class="t s1_161">accept whatsoever the interpretation is. </div>
<div id="tg_161" class="t s1_161">One man, Adi Irani, was the secretary of Meher Baba for almost his whole life. </div>
<div id="th_161" class="t s1_161">And whenever I used to go to Ahmednagar, Adi Irani, if he was in the city, used </div>
<div id="ti_161" class="t s1_161">to come to see me. He has written all Meher Baba's books; Meher Baba simply </div>
<div id="tj_161" class="t s1_161">made signs. First he used to use the board, then he dropped the board because </div>
<div id="tk_161" class="t s1_161">people started criticizing him. "It is the same thing as typing, just a slower </div>
<div id="tl_161" class="t s1_161">process, a bullock cart process in a rocket age. What nonsense is this?" </div>
<div id="tm_161" class="t s1_161">So Meher Baba dropped the board and he trained Adi Irani. He would make </div>
<div id="tn_161" class="t s1_161">gestures with his hands; nobody knew what he was doing. Only Adi Irani knew </div>
<div id="to_161" class="t s1_161">and he wrote the books. I asked Adi Irani, "Are you certain that whatever you </div>
<div id="tp_161" class="t s1_161">are writing is really what he wants to say?" </div>
<div id="tq_161" class="t s1_161">He said, "I cannot speak a lie -- at least to you. I don't know. I figure it must be </div>
<div id="tr_161" class="t s1_161">right because he has never objected." </div>
<div id="ts_161" class="t s1_161">Now this seems to be hilarious. He did not know whether he was interpreting </div>
<div id="tt_161" class="t s1_161">him exactly or he was just managing himself </div>
<div id="tu_161" class="t s1_161">....</div>
<div id="tv_161" class="t s1_161">and because Meher Baba had </div>
<div id="tw_161" class="t s1_161">never objected, that was the only reason that Adi Irani thought he must be right. </div>
<div id="tx_161" class="t s1_161">I said,"Do you really understand exactly? ... because by symbols small things can </div>
<div id="ty_161" class="t s1_161">be explained: you are hungry, you can just show your stomach; you are thirsty, </div>
<div id="tz_161" class="t s1_161">you can just show by your hands that you need water. But great philosophical </div>
<div id="t10_161" class="t s1_161">treatises? I can't conceive how you can make symbols for them -- and how many </div>
<div id="t11_161" class="t s1_161">symbols will be needed? With only your ten fingers ..." And Adi Irani has written </div>
<div id="t12_161" class="t s1_161">almost fifty books, and not small ones -- five hundred pages, one thousand </div>
<div id="t13_161" class="t s1_161">pages. </div>
<div id="t14_161" class="t s1_161">I told Adi Irani, "It is all your imagination. You are a good writer, but those </div>
<div id="t15_161" class="t s1_161">books are your writings, not Meher Baba's. But he is silent because you are </div>
<div id="t16_161" class="t s1_161">writing well and people are accepting those writings in his name." Meher Baba </div>
<div id="t17_161" class="t s1_161">had a worldwide following, but he was absolutely dependent; he could not move </div>
<div id="t18_161" class="t s1_161">anywhere without Adi Irani because wherever he went alone he would be </div>
<div id="t19_161" class="t s1_161">thought mad. Nobody would understand what he was trying to say. </div>
