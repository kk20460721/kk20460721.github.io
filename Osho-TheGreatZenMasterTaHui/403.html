<div id="t2_403" class="t s1_403">other by remaining absolutely centered, but available to anyone who knocks at his door.</div>
<div id="t3_403" class="t s1_403">I don't see the conflict as it has been seen down the ages. Those who see the conflict are</div>
<div id="t4_403" class="t s1_403">only learned people; they are neither arhatas nor bodhisattvas.</div>
<div id="t5_403" class="t s1_403">I am reminded of a great master, Ma Tsu. His monastery was just opposite another</div>
<div id="t6_403" class="t s1_403">monastery in the deep mountains, and the other master was absolutely antagonistic to the</div>
<div id="t7_403" class="t s1_403">methods and to the teachings of Ma Tsu. One disciple of Ma Tsu was having difficult times</div>
<div id="t8_403" class="t s1_403">with the master, because Ma Tsu used to hit, beat ...</div>
<div id="t9_403" class="t s1_403">It was known that once Ma Tsu had thrown a disciple out of the window and jumped on</div>
<div id="ta_403" class="t s1_403">top of him. The disciple had a few fractures and Ma Tsu was sitting on his chest asking, "Got</div>
<div id="tb_403" class="t s1_403">it?" And the strangest thing is that he got it! He never asked a question again! That simply</div>
<div id="tc_403" class="t s1_403">shows he must have got it; since then he became absolutely silent.</div>
<div id="td_403" class="t s1_403">The other master was very angry at Ma Tsu: "What kind of things does he go on doing? He</div>
<div id="te_403" class="t s1_403">seems to be a crazy man!"</div>
<div id="tf_403" class="t s1_403">One day a disciple who was meditating on a koan came in. He had been coming for many</div>
<div id="tg_403" class="t s1_403">days and getting a beating. There are hundreds of koans in Zen -- strange puzzles. He was</div>
<div id="th_403" class="t s1_403">meditating on the famous koan, "the sound of one hand clapping." Ma Tsu had said,</div>
<div id="ti_403" class="t s1_403">"Whenever you have found the sound, come to me."</div>
<div id="tj_403" class="t s1_403">The disciple meditated in the silence of the night, he heard the wind passing through the</div>
<div id="tk_403" class="t s1_403">pine trees, and he jumped. He said, "This is it!" The sound was so sweet and of course so</div>
<div id="tl_403" class="t s1_403">musical that he went to the master and told him that it is the sound when the wind passes</div>
<div id="tm_403" class="t s1_403">through the pine trees ... The master hit him hard and said, "Don't bring any idiotic answers to</div>
<div id="tn_403" class="t s1_403">me, just go back and meditate."</div>
<div id="to_403" class="t s1_403">And this went on happening. One time he heard a cuckoo calling in the night ... so sweet,</div>
<div id="tp_403" class="t s1_403">so overwhelming, so touching that he forgot all the beatings and went again. Finally he got</div>
<div id="tq_403" class="t s1_403">tired. He had brought all the sounds possible, and no answer was being received, every answer</div>
<div id="tr_403" class="t s1_403">was being rejected. An idea arose in his mind, "Perhaps this is not the master -- at least for</div>
<div id="ts_403" class="t s1_403">me. I am not saying that he is not a master, but at least he is not for me. I should try his</div>
<div id="tt_403" class="t s1_403">opponent who is just nearby." And he went there.</div>
<div id="tu_403" class="t s1_403">The master asked him, "You are a disciple of Ma Tsu, why have you come to me?" The</div>
<div id="tv_403" class="t s1_403">disciple described what had been going on for months: he brings new sounds and he gets only</div>
<div id="tw_403" class="t s1_403">beatings. There is a limit to patience, and he has come here in search of truth, not to hear the</div>
<div id="tx_403" class="t s1_403">sound of one hand clapping. "Unnecessarily, I am being held back by this, and now I have</div>
<div id="ty_403" class="t s1_403">almost exhausted every sound, but he goes on beating. I have come to you. Accept me as your</div>
<div id="tz_403" class="t s1_403">disciple."</div>
<div id="t10_403" class="t s1_403">That master had never beaten anyone, but he gave this disciple such a beating that Ma</div>
<div id="t11_403" class="t s1_403">Tsu's beating felt far better! The master said, "You idiot! Just go back, your master is very</div>
<div id="t12_403" class="t s1_403">compassionate. He only beats you, you need to be killed! Just go back."</div>
<div id="t13_403" class="t s1_403">The disciple said, "My God! I have been in search of truth ... First these people go on</div>
<div id="t14_403" class="t s1_403">talking about enlightenment, and when you get caught in their idea, then they do all kinds of</div>
<div id="t15_403" class="t s1_403">strange things to you. This man has been known always to be against Ma Tsu, and he has</div>
<div id="t16_403" class="t s1_403">never used the device of beating. Why has he done this to me? But certainly, if I have to</div>
<div id="t17_403" class="t s1_403">choose between the two, Ma Tsu is better."</div>
<div id="t18_403" class="t s1_403">Chapter 36 - Compassion</div>
<div id="t19_403" class="t s1_403">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
