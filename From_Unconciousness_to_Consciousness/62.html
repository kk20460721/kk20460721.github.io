<div id="t1_62" class="t s1_62">CHAPTER 6. THE SO-CALLED HOLY BOOKS ARE JUST RELIGIOUS PORNOGRAPHY</div>
<div id="t2_62" class="t s2_62">the verge of converting to Christianity; one time he was ready to convert to Jainism. He accepted</div>
<div id="t3_62" class="t s2_62">three persons as his masters: one is a Jaina, Shrimad Rajchandra; the second is Leo Tolstoy, who</div>
<div id="t4_62" class="t s2_62">was a fanatic Christian; and the third is Henry Thoreau, who was also a fanatic Christian.</div>
<div id="t5_62" class="t s2_62">I have been talking to these Jaina monks and telling them the story of Mahatma Gandhi, what</div>
<div id="t6_62" class="t s2_62">happened to him.</div>
<div id="t7_62" class="t s2_62">In his ashram no love affair was allowed; even husbands and wives, if they</div>
<div id="t8_62" class="t s2_62">wanted to become inmates of the ashram, had to take the vow of brahmacharya, celibacy. That</div>
<div id="t9_62" class="t s2_62">was a basic rule. So there were husbands and wives but they were both celibate. It was not being</div>
<div id="ta_62" class="t s2_62">followed; they were caught again and again. And Gandhi was a masochist, just as I have told you</div>
<div id="tb_62" class="t s2_62">that Mahavira had masochism in him – enjoying torturing oneself.</div>
<div id="tc_62" class="t s2_62">There is a certain mind disease which gives you pleasure out of pain. So what Mahatma Gandhi</div>
<div id="td_62" class="t s2_62">used to do, whenever a couple was found that had broken celibacy</div>
<div id="te_62" class="t s2_62">....</div>
<div id="tf_62" class="t s2_62">And it was such a sensitive</div>
<div id="tg_62" class="t s2_62">affair that there was no need for an actual sex relationship to happen.</div>
<div id="th_62" class="t s2_62">Just holding hands – if</div>
<div id="ti_62" class="t s2_62">somebody had seen them, that was enough; or hugging each other – one’s own wife. What Mahatma</div>
<div id="tj_62" class="t s2_62">Gandhi would do is, he would go on a fast, he would torture himself. He would not punish those</div>
<div id="tk_62" class="t s2_62">people, but it was really a greater punishment than any you could have invented because the whole</div>
<div id="tl_62" class="t s2_62">ashram would condemn the couple. The couple would be tortured by their own conscience: ”It is</div>
<div id="tm_62" class="t s2_62">because of us he is fasting.” They would weep and cry and persuade him, ”Forgive us, we will never</div>
<div id="tn_62" class="t s2_62">do it again; but break your fast.”</div>
<div id="to_62" class="t s2_62">He would say, ”I am not punishing you; I am punishing myself. This is a symbol to me that I am not</div>
<div id="tp_62" class="t s2_62">pure enough; that’s why around me such impure things happen. I am simply purifying myself.” Now</div>
<div id="tq_62" class="t s2_62">this too is a very subtle way of the ego: you have done something and I decide to be responsible</div>
<div id="tr_62" class="t s2_62">for it. On the surface it looks, ”How saintly!” – but deep down nothing can be more egoistic. Who</div>
<div id="ts_62" class="t s2_62">am I? How does my purity or impurity come into your life? But he was just thinking in terms of the</div>
<div id="tt_62" class="t s2_62">old scriptures – that if you are a real saint then around you nothing impure can happen. But what is</div>
<div id="tu_62" class="t s2_62">impure? A man loving a woman – what is impure in it? His own woman, not against her will – what</div>
<div id="tv_62" class="t s2_62">is impure in it? And if it is impure, then everybody is born of impurity. Your very birth is in impurity.</div>
<div id="tw_62" class="t s2_62">I have asked these Jaina monks, ”What happened to Mahatma Gandhi in the last years of his life?”</div>
<div id="tx_62" class="t s2_62">... Because his whole life he was repressing, repressing, repressing, and the moment came when</div>
<div id="ty_62" class="t s2_62">it became too much, beyond his capacity to control it anymore. Then people ﬁnd rationalizations.</div>
<div id="tz_62" class="t s2_62">Then he started to sleep with a naked woman – but he had a cunning mind, he rationalized it. He</div>
<div id="t10_62" class="t s2_62">said he was just testing whether anywhere in his unconscious the woman still had some attraction.</div>
<div id="t11_62" class="t s2_62">Does he still feel fascinated by a naked young girl? And he was beyond seventy and the girl he was</div>
<div id="t12_62" class="t s2_62">sleeping with was only twenty.</div>
<div id="t13_62" class="t s2_62">This was not told to the public at large, because his disciples were afraid that he would lose his</div>
<div id="t14_62" class="t s2_62">mahatmahood. People will start thinking, ”What is this?” It was suppressed, kept from reaching the</div>
<div id="t15_62" class="t s2_62">public; only a few disciples, close disciples who could keep their mouths shut, knew about it. But in</div>
<div id="t16_62" class="t s2_62">the eyes of those close disciples Gandhi had already fallen, he was no more the same mahatma he</div>
<div id="t17_62" class="t s2_62">used to be.</div>
<div id="t18_62" class="t s2_62">I have been telling these Jaina monks, ”Try to understand Gandhi, what happened to him. And this</div>
<div id="t19_62" class="t s2_62">will happen to you. But you can remain so starved that there is no energy left in you.” That was</div>
<div id="t1a_62" class="t s2_62">Mahatma Gandhi’s mistake; otherwise this would not have happened. It was because he was eating</div>
<div id="t1b_62" class="t s2_62">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t1c_62" class="t s2_62">62</div>
