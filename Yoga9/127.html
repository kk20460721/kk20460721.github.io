<div id="t1_127" class="t s1_127">When a child asks his mother, "Who created the world?" there is every temptation for the </div>
<div id="t2_127" class="t s1_127">mother to say, "God created the world" -- not knowing at all what she is saying. </div>
<div id="t3_127" class="t s1_127">This is the basic reason why when children grow up they become almost antagonistic </div>
<div id="t4_127" class="t s1_127">towards their parents; they can never forgive them because they lie too much. They lose </div>
<div id="t5_127" class="t s1_127">all respect for them. Parents go on saying, "Why? We loved you. We brought you up. </div>
<div id="t6_127" class="t s1_127">The best we could do we have done. Why don't children respect us?" You have lost the </div>
<div id="t7_127" class="t s1_127">opportunity because of your lies. Once the child discovers that the mother and the father </div>
<div id="t8_127" class="t s1_127">have been lying, all respect disappears. Deceiving a small helpless child? Saying things </div>
<div id="t9_127" class="t s1_127">they did not know anything about? </div>
<div id="ta_127" class="t s1_127">That Jabala was a rare mother. She said, "I don't know who is your father." She accepted </div>
<div id="tb_127" class="t s1_127">that when she was young she was moving with many men. She loved many men and was </div>
<div id="tc_127" class="t s1_127">being loved by many men, so she docs not know who is the father. A true mother. And </div>
<div id="td_127" class="t s1_127">the child was also brave. He told it to the Master; he repeated exactly the words that the </div>
<div id="te_127" class="t s1_127">mother had said. </div>
<div id="tf_127" class="t s1_127">This truth appealed to Gautama; and he said, "You are a true brahmin." This is the </div>
<div id="tg_127" class="t s1_127">definition of being a brahmin; a true man is a brahmin. A brahmin has nothing to do with </div>
<div id="th_127" class="t s1_127">any caste. The very word comes from "Brahman"; it means "a seeker of God," a true </div>
<div id="ti_127" class="t s1_127">authentic seeker. </div>
<div id="tj_127" class="t s1_127">Remember, the more you get involved in lies, howsoever paying they appear in the </div>
<div id="tk_127" class="t s1_127">beginning, in the end you wi]l find that they have poisoned your whole being. </div>
<div id="tl_127" class="t s1_127">Be authentic. If you are authentic, sooner or later you will discover you are not the body. </div>
<div id="tm_127" class="t s1_127">Because authenticity cannot go on believing in a lie. The clarity dawns, the eyes become </div>
<div id="tn_127" class="t s1_127">more perceptive, and you can see: you are in the body, certainly, but you are not the </div>
<div id="to_127" class="t s1_127">body. When a hand is broken, you are not broken. When you have a fractured leg, you </div>
<div id="tp_127" class="t s1_127">are not fractured. When there is a headache, you know the headache; you are not the </div>
<div id="tq_127" class="t s1_127">headache itself. When you feel hungry, you know the hunger, but you are not hungry. By </div>

<div id="ts_127" class="t s1_127">thoughts, dreams floating in the consciousness. Then you can distinguish, discriminate -- </div>
<div id="tt_127" class="t s1_127">what Patanjali calls vivek -- then you can discriminate what is the cloud and what is the </div>
<div id="tu_127" class="t s1_127">sky. </div>
<div id="tv_127" class="t s1_127">Thoughts are like clouds moving in empty space. That empty space is the real sky, not the </div>
<div id="tw_127" class="t s1_127">clouds -- they come and go. Not the thoughts, but the empty space in which those </div>
<div id="tx_127" class="t s1_127">thoughts appear and disappear. </div>
<div id="ty_127" class="t s1_127">Now let me tell you one very basic yoga structure of your being. </div>
<div id="tz_127" class="t s1_127">Just as physicists think that the whole consists of nothing but electrons, electric energy, </div>
<div id="t10_127" class="t s1_127">yoga thinks that the whole consists of nothing but sound electrons. The basic element of </div>
<div id="t11_127" class="t s1_127">existence for yoga is sound because life is nothing but a vibration. Life is nothing but an </div>
<div id="t12_127" class="t s1_127">expression of silence. Out of silence we come and into silence we dissolve again. Silence, </div>
<div id="t13_127" class="t s1_127">space, nothingness, nonbeing, is your innermost core, the hub of the wheel. Unless you </div>
<div id="t14_127" class="t s1_127">come to that silence, to that space where nothing else remains except your pure being, </div>
<div id="t15_127" class="t s1_127">liberation is not attained. This is the yoga framework. </div>
<div id="t16_127" class="t s1_127">They divide your being into four layers. I am speaking to you; this is the ]ast layer. Yoga </div>
<div id="t17_127" class="t s1_127">calls it vaikhari; the word means "fruition," flowering. But before I speak to you, before I </div>
<div id="t18_127" class="t s1_127">utter something, it becomes manifest to me as a feeling, as an experience; that is the third </div>
<div id="t19_127" class="t s1_127">stage. Yoga calls it MADHYAMA, "the middle." But before something is experienced </div>
<div id="t1a_127" class="t s1_127">inside, it moves in a seed form. You cannot experience it ordinarily unless you are very </div>
