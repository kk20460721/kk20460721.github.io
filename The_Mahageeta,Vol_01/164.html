<div id="t1_164" class="t s1_164">CHAPTER 8.</div>
<div id="t2_164" class="t s2_164">You don’t know what you have found in your search and what remains incomplete. Every time death</div>
<div id="t3_164" class="t s2_164">has come and rubbed out everything that you have done. There are many among you who have</div>
<div id="t4_164" class="t s2_164">taken sannyas many times – every time death came and erased everything. And you don’t have the</div>
<div id="t5_164" class="t s2_164">ability to recall it.</div>
<div id="t6_164" class="t s2_164">Understand it like this, you had been creating something... you had been painting a picture, when</div>
<div id="t7_164" class="t s2_164">death came and it remained incomplete. Death came and you forgot. You were born again. Then</div>
<div id="t8_164" class="t s2_164">even if you get a message about that incomplete painting – even if that incomplete painting is put in</div>
<div id="t9_164" class="t s2_164">front of you, you won’t remember. Because in this life you had never even thought of yourself as a</div>
<div id="ta_164" class="t s2_164">painter And if I tell you, ”Finish the painting, it has been left incomplete, you had made it with great</div>
<div id="tb_164" class="t s2_164">hopes, you had created it with a very deep thirst – now just go ahead and ﬁnish it. Death had come</div>
<div id="tc_164" class="t s2_164">in between and it was left incomplete.”</div>
<div id="td_164" class="t s2_164">You will say, ”I don’t know anything, you can have me take up the brush but I don’t even know how</div>
<div id="te_164" class="t s2_164">to hold it. You can put the colors in front of me and I will paint but I don’t know anything about how to</div>
<div id="tf_164" class="t s2_164">paint.” Still, I tell you to start, and just by starting the memory will come. Just take the brush in your</div>
<div id="tg_164" class="t s2_164">hand and perhaps you will be reminded.</div>
<div id="th_164" class="t s2_164">It happened in the Second World War, a soldier was wounded and fell. He lost his memory. He had</div>
<div id="ti_164" class="t s2_164">received a blow to the head. His memory cells got messed up. He forgot. He forgot – even his own</div>
<div id="tj_164" class="t s2_164">name. He forgot who he was. And he was unconscious when he was taken from the battleﬁeld. His</div>
<div id="tk_164" class="t s2_164">identiﬁcation had fallen off somewhere, his number too had fallen. It was a great problem. When he</div>
<div id="tl_164" class="t s2_164">came to his senses he didn’t know his number, he didn’t know his name, he didn’t know his rank.</div>
<div id="tm_164" class="t s2_164">The psychologists worked hard. They tried in every way to remind him but couldn’t ﬁnd out anything.</div>
<div id="tn_164" class="t s2_164">The man had gone completely blank. As if all connection with his memory had suddenly broken off.</div>
<div id="to_164" class="t s2_164">Someone suggested that now there was only one way: have him taken all around England. He was</div>
<div id="tp_164" class="t s2_164">a soldier in the British army. If he was taken around England, perhaps when he came near his own</div>
<div id="tq_164" class="t s2_164">village he would remember.</div>
<div id="tr_164" class="t s2_164">So he was taken around England on the trains. Two men took him around. The train stopped at</div>
<div id="ts_164" class="t s2_164">every station and they brought him down. He stood and stared. They got tired. England is a small</div>
<div id="tt_164" class="t s2_164">country, so it wasn’t very difﬁcult to take him everywhere. In the end at a very small station where</div>
<div id="tu_164" class="t s2_164">the train didn’t usually stop, but for some reason it did this time, the man got off, read the sign on</div>
<div id="tv_164" class="t s2_164">the station and said, ”This is my village!” He began to run. He forgot that there were two men with</div>
<div id="tw_164" class="t s2_164">him. The two men began running after him. He ran out of the station and into the village</div>
<div id="tx_164" class="t s2_164">. ...</div>
<div id="ty_164" class="t s2_164">he</div>
<div id="tz_164" class="t s2_164">remembered everything. He remembered the lanes and paths. He didn’t even ask anyone. Passing</div>
<div id="t10_164" class="t s2_164">through the lanes and bypaths he arrived in front of his house. He said, ”Oh! This is my house, this</div>
<div id="t11_164" class="t s2_164">is my name. This is my name plate hanging here.” He remembered everything. Just one hit and his</div>
<div id="t12_164" class="t s2_164">whole memory came back again. Forgetfulness disappeared, the memory cells came back together</div>
<div id="t13_164" class="t s2_164">again.</div>
<div id="t14_164" class="t s2_164">So sometimes I give sannyas as I gave it to Dayal in the hope that if I send you around in orange</div>
<div id="t15_164" class="t s2_164">clothes, perhaps you will remember that you have previously moved in orange clothes too. If I say:</div>
<div id="t16_164" class="t s2_164">”Dance!” Perhaps while you are dancing, one day you will arrive at that psychological space, where</div>
<div id="t17_164" class="t s2_164">you will remember your dancing of past lives. I say, ”Meditate.” While you are meditating perhaps</div>
<div id="t18_164" class="t s2_164">some door in the unconscious will open and a ﬂood of memories will come.</div>
<div id="t19_164" class="t s2_164">This is why I go on speaking – sometimes on the Geeta, sometimes on Ashtavakra, sometimes</div>
<div id="t1a_164" class="t s2_164">The Mahageeta, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t1b_164" class="t s2_164">164</div>
<div id="t1c_164" class="t s3_164">Osho</div>
