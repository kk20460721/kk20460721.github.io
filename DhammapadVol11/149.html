<div id="t1_149" class="t s1_149">there are so many competitors. And I will have to stand in a queue, and that I hate! I am </div>
<div id="t2_149" class="t s1_149">ready to go to hell, I am ready to suffer in hell, but I want to be the first." </div>
<div id="t3_149" class="t s1_149">The ego is always hankering to be the first. It says, "My misery is bigger than anybody </div>
<div id="t4_149" class="t s1_149">else's. Whatsoever I am, I am bigger, I am special, I am extraordinary." </div>
<div id="t5_149" class="t s1_149">Once a high court judge came to me. His wife used to come to me. I was surprised, </div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s1_149">because the wife always used to say that he is very much against me and he does not </div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s1_149">want her to listen to me or read my books or to go and see me. But whenever I visited </div>
<div id="t8_149" class="t s1_149">that city she was always coming. </div>
<div id="t9_149" class="t s1_149">So I was surprised. I asked him, "Your wife always says you are very much against me." </div>
<div id="ta_149" class="t s1_149">He said, "Not that I am very much against you -- I am simply afraid that</div>
<div id="tb_149" class="t s1_149">....</div>
<div id="tc_149" class="t s1_149">My wife is </div>
<div id="td_149" class="t s1_149">already crazy, and what you are saying, if it gets into her mind, she exaggerates </div>
<div id="te_149" class="t s1_149">everything. You will create more trouble for me." </div>
<div id="tf_149" class="t s1_149">I asked him, "Why have YOU come?" </div>
<div id="tg_149" class="t s1_149">He said, "I have just come to say to you that if she says that she has cancer, reduce it to a </div>
<div id="th_149" class="t s1_149">headache. Don't be bothered about her cancer. I have suffered my whole life. Then I </div>
<div id="ti_149" class="t s1_149">have learned this lesson: she exaggerates." </div>
<div id="tj_149" class="t s1_149">And in fact that was the case. Every time she used to come she was talking about </div>
<div id="tk_149" class="t s1_149">cancer. She was telling that she has cancer of the heart and this and that -- and the </div>
<div id="tl_149" class="t s1_149">husband said she had nothing! Just a hypochondriac... she goes on exaggerating. </div>
<div id="tm_149" class="t s1_149">A hypochondriac died. Before he was dying his wife asked, "Have you some last </div>
<div id="tn_149" class="t s1_149">words?" </div>
<div id="to_149" class="t s1_149">He said, "Yes. On my gravestone write in big letters: Now do you believe me or not?" </div>
<div id="tp_149" class="t s1_149">The first thing for you is to bring things down to the level of reality. It is difficult, </div>
<div id="tq_149" class="t s1_149">Vandan, particularly so for a woman. They live in fancy. When you fall in love you </div>
<div id="tr_149" class="t s1_149">think you have fallen in love with a Greek god, and by the time the honeymoon is </div>
<div id="ts_149" class="t s1_149">finished you know he is nothing but a goddamned Greek! Within seven days the Greek </div>
<div id="tt_149" class="t s1_149">god is nothing but a goddamned Greek. </div>
<div id="tu_149" class="t s1_149">And again it will happen. Again you will fall in love, and again you will create a great </div>
<div id="tv_149" class="t s1_149">fancy, you will create projections. And all your projections are going to be shattered </div>
<div id="tw_149" class="t s1_149">sooner or later, because reality has no obligation to fulfill your projections. </div>
<div id="tx_149" class="t s1_149">So first bring down your idea of misery to the fact, to the real. And then it is not difficult </div>
<div id="ty_149" class="t s1_149">to get out of it. Then the second thing is to be aware of it. Just be aware of it, and you </div>
<div id="tz_149" class="t s1_149">are out of it -- because you can be aware only if you are not it. </div>
<div id="t10_149" class="t s1_149">That is the miracle of awareness. When you observe something one thing is certain, </div>
<div id="t11_149" class="t s1_149">absolutely certain: that you are not it. The observer is never the observed. The observed </div>
<div id="t12_149" class="t s1_149">is there as an object confronting you. You are the observer, you are the subject. </div>
<div id="t13_149" class="t s1_149">So misery is there, pain is there or pleasure, or whatsoever experience is there -- you are </div>
<div id="t14_149" class="t s1_149">not it. You are out of it! </div>
