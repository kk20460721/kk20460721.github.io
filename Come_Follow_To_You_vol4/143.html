<div id="t2_143" class="t s1_143">because of the furniture. Now the room is complete, the emptiness is total. </div>
<div id="t3_143" class="t s1_143">You can look from two ends. If you are too furniture-oriented, so that you can </div>
<div id="t4_143" class="t s1_143">only look at the chairs and tables and the sofa and you cannot see the roominess </div>
<div id="t5_143" class="t s1_143">of the room, then it will feel empty. But if you know, and you can see emptiness </div>
<div id="t6_143" class="t s1_143">directly, you will feel a tremendous freedom which was not there before because </div>
<div id="t7_143" class="t s1_143">the room was missing; you could not move in it. Go on filling it with furniture, </div>
<div id="t8_143" class="t s1_143">and there will come a point when you cannot move because the whole room is </div>
<div id="t9_143" class="t s1_143">gone. </div>
<div id="ta_143" class="t s1_143">Once I stayed in a very rich man's house. He was very rich, but had no taste. His </div>
<div id="tb_143" class="t s1_143">house was so full that it was not a house at all. You could not move, and you </div>
<div id="tc_143" class="t s1_143">were always afraid to move because he had precious antiques. He himself was </div>
<div id="td_143" class="t s1_143">afraid to move. The servants were constantly worried. He gave me the best, the </div>
<div id="te_143" class="t s1_143">most beautiful room in his house. And I told him,'This is not a room, it is a </div>
<div id="tf_143" class="t s1_143">museum. Please give me something where I can move, then it will be a room. </div>
<div id="tg_143" class="t s1_143">This is not a room. The room has almost disappeared.' The room means: the </div>
<div id="th_143" class="t s1_143">freedom that space gives you. </div>
<div id="ti_143" class="t s1_143">When you are working, creating, your mind is full of many things. The mind is </div>
<div id="tj_143" class="t s1_143">occupied. Writing a novel the mind is occupied; writing a poem the mind is </div>
<div id="tk_143" class="t s1_143">occupied; there is too much furniture in it -- the furniture of the mind: thoughts, </div>
<div id="tl_143" class="t s1_143">feelings, characters. Then the book is finished. Suddenly, the furniture is gone. </div>
<div id="tm_143" class="t s1_143">You feel empty. But there is no need to become sad. If you look at it rightly -- this </div>
<div id="tn_143" class="t s1_143">is what Buddha called right-vision, SAMYAK DRASTHI -- if you look rightly, </div>
<div id="to_143" class="t s1_143">you will feel freed of an obsession, of an occupation. You will feel clean again, </div>
<div id="tp_143" class="t s1_143">unburdened. Those characters of the novel are no longer moving there. Those </div>
<div id="tq_143" class="t s1_143">guests are gone and the host is totally at ease. Enjoy it. Your wrong interpretation </div>
<div id="tr_143" class="t s1_143">is creating sadness for you, and fear. Enjoy it. Have you never observed that </div>
<div id="ts_143" class="t s1_143">when a guest comes you feel good; when he goes you feel even better? He leaves </div>
<div id="tt_143" class="t s1_143">you alone, and now you have your own space. </div>
<div id="tu_143" class="t s1_143">To write a novel is maddening because so many characters become guests, and </div>

<div id="tw_143" class="t s1_143">always. Sometimes he has his own way, and he forces the writer in a certain </div>
<div id="tx_143" class="t s1_143">direction. The writer starts the novel, but never ends it. Then those characters </div>
<div id="ty_143" class="t s1_143">end it by themselves. </div>
<div id="tz_143" class="t s1_143">It is just like giving birth to a child. You can give birth to a child, but then the </div>
