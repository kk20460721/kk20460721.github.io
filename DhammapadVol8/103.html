<div id="t1_103" class="t s1_103">So he did the right thing and he married the girl. And about six months later, when he </div>
<div id="t2_103" class="t s1_103">saw the preacher again, he tried to murder him. </div>
<div id="t3_103" class="t s1_103">"You miserable liar!" shouted the young man. "You told me if I married her I would be </div>
<div id="t4_103" class="t s1_103">at the end of my troubles. Well, I married her and she has made my life miserable!" </div>
<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">"That may be true, son, but you can't blame me," replied the minister. "I said you would </div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">be at the end of your troubles, but I never said which end." </div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s1_103">To be in the world is hard, to live in the world IS difficult, because it is living with so </div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s1_103">many lunatics. You yourself are a lunatic and everybody else is a lunatic! The world is </div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s1_103">in such a mess. It simply seems impossible how the good God could manage within six </div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s1_103">days to make such a mess of the world! There was not time enough... and no woman </div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s1_103">even to advise him! Still he managed. </div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s1_103">Those who know, they say he created Eve only in the end simply so that she would not </div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s1_103">give advice to him; otherwise in six days it would have been impossible to make the </div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">world. She would have interfered in everything: "Do it this way. This is not right." And </div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">since he created Eve he has not created anything else. That was too much! He called it a </div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">day and he said, "Enough is enough!" Since then nothing has been heard about him. </div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">Shed a tear for the beatnik who committed suicide, leaving a note saying, "Goodbye, </div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s1_103">cool world." </div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">It is really icy-cold -- no warmth anywhere, no love anywhere, no compassion </div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s1_103">anywhere. IT IS HARD TO LIVE IN THE WORLD AND HARD TO LIVE OUT OF IT. </div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s1_103">And it is not easy to live out of it either; it is even harder to live out of it. </div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s1_103">Man is in such a dilemma! It is difficult to live in the world, it is difficult not to live in </div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s1_103">the world. Have you ever tried living in a Himalayan cave? Try for one month, and the </div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s1_103">world will look so beautiful and so heavenly! A few experiences you have had. It is </div>
<div id="tp_103" class="t s1_103">difficult to live with the wife, but when she goes for a few days to her mother's house, it </div>
<div id="tq_103" class="t s1_103">is very difficult to live without her. When she is with you, you want to be without her; </div>
<div id="tr_103" class="t s1_103">when she is gone, you want her immediately back. </div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s1_103">It is going to be so, because the ultimate question is neither to live in the world nor out </div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s1_103">of it. The ultimate question is to live in a state of wakefulness. If you are living in sleep </div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s1_103">IN the world you will be in misery; if you live outside the world you will be in far more </div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">misery. </div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">I know both types of people, the worldly and the otherworldly. I know the people who </div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">live in the marketplace, and I know the people who have renounced the marketplace, </div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">and have moved to the monasteries. Both are in misery, deep misery, for the simple </div>
<div id="tz_103" class="t s1_103">reason that just changing the place, just changing your address from the marketplace to </div>
<div id="t10_103" class="t s1_103">the monastery, does not make any difference at all. You are the same person, your </div>
<div id="t11_103" class="t s1_103">consciousness has not changed. And change is needed there. Then you can become the </div>
<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">center of the cyclone. Then you can live in the cyclone and yet undisturbed. </div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">But Buddha says that is very rare. </div>
