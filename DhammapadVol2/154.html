<div id="t1_154" class="t s1_154">The other boy was struck dumb. He could not even answer. He could not find anything </div>
<div id="t2_154" class="t s1_154">to say. He was really embarrassed, ashamed, and felt also, "My master was right not to </div>
<div id="t3_154" class="t s1_154">talk with these people -- these are dangerous people! What kind of talk is this? I had </div>
<div id="t4_154" class="t s1_154">asked a simple question: 'Where are you going?' In fact I already knew where he was </div>
<div id="t5_154" class="t s1_154">going, because we were both going to purchase vegetables in the market. A simple </div>
<div id="t6_154" class="t s1_154">answer would have done." </div>
<div id="t7_154" class="t s1_154">He went back, told his master, "I am sorry, excuse me. You HAD prohibited me, I didn't </div>
<div id="t8_154" class="t s1_154">listen to you. In fact, because of your prohibition I was tempted. This is the first time I </div>
<div id="t9_154" class="t s1_154">have talked to those dangerous people. I just asked a simple question. 'Where are you </div>
<div id="ta_154" class="t s1_154">going?' and he started saying strange things: 'There is no going, no coming. Who </div>
<div id="tb_154" class="t s1_154">comes? Who goes? I am utter emptiness,' he was saying, 'just a dead leaf in the wind. </div>
<div id="tc_154" class="t s1_154">And wherever the wind takes me</div>
<div id="td_154" class="t s1_154">....</div>
<div id="te_154" class="t s1_154">'" </div>
<div id="tf_154" class="t s1_154">The master said, "I told you before! Now, tomorrow stand in the same place and when </div>
<div id="tg_154" class="t s1_154">he comes ask him again, 'Where are you going?' And when he says these things, you </div>
<div id="th_154" class="t s1_154">simply say, 'That's true. Yes, you are a dead leaf, so am I. But when the wind is not </div>
<div id="ti_154" class="t s1_154">blowing, where are you going? Then where can you go?' Just say that, and that will </div>
<div id="tj_154" class="t s1_154">embarrass him -- and he has to be embarrassed, he has to be defeated. We have been </div>
<div id="tk_154" class="t s1_154">constantly quarreling, and those people have not been able to defeat us in any debate. </div>
<div id="tl_154" class="t s1_154">So tomorrow it has to be done!" </div>
<div id="tm_154" class="t s1_154">Early the boy got up, prepared his answer, repeated it many times before he went. Then </div>
<div id="tn_154" class="t s1_154">he stood in the place where the boy used to cross the road, repeated again and again, </div>
<div id="to_154" class="t s1_154">prepared himself, and then he saw the boy coming. He said, "Okay, now!" </div>
<div id="tp_154" class="t s1_154">The boy came. He asked, "Where are you going?" And he was hoping that now the </div>
<div id="tq_154" class="t s1_154">opportunity would come</div>
<div id="tr_154" class="t s1_154">....</div>
<div id="ts_154" class="t s1_154">But the boy said, "Wherever the legs will take me</div>
<div id="tt_154" class="t s1_154">....</div>
<div id="tu_154" class="t s1_154">" No mention of wind! No talk of </div>
<div id="tv_154" class="t s1_154">nothingness! No question of the nondoer! Now what to do? His whole ready-made </div>
<div id="tw_154" class="t s1_154">answer looked absurd. Now to talk about the wind would be irrelevant. </div>
<div id="tx_154" class="t s1_154">Again crestfallen, now REALLY ashamed that he was simply stupid: "And this boy </div>
<div id="ty_154" class="t s1_154">certainly knows some strange things -- now he says, 'Wherever the legs take me</div>
<div id="tz_154" class="t s1_154">....</div>
<div id="t10_154" class="t s1_154">'" </div>
<div id="t11_154" class="t s1_154">He went back to the master. The master said, "I have told you NOT to talk with those </div>
<div id="t12_154" class="t s1_154">people -- they are dangerous! This is our centuries-long experience. But now something </div>
<div id="t13_154" class="t s1_154">has to be done. So tomorrow you ask again, 'Where are you going?' and when he says, </div>
<div id="t14_154" class="t s1_154">'Wherever my legs take me,' tell him, 'If you had no legs, then...?' He has to be silenced </div>
<div id="t15_154" class="t s1_154">one way or other!" </div>
<div id="t16_154" class="t s1_154">So the next day he asked again, "Where are you going?" and waited. </div>
<div id="t17_154" class="t s1_154">And the boy said, "I am going to the market to fetch vegetables." </div>
<div id="t18_154" class="t s1_154">Man ordinarily functions out of the past, and life goes on changing. Life has no </div>
<div id="t19_154" class="t s1_154">obligation to fit with your conclusions. That's why life is very confusing -- confusing to </div>
<div id="t1a_154" class="t s1_154">the knowledgeable person. He has all ready-made answers: The Bhagavadgita, the holy </div>
<div id="t1b_154" class="t s1_154">Koran, the Bible, the Vedas. He has everything crammed, he knows all the answers. But </div>
<div id="t1c_154" class="t s1_154">life never raises the same question again; hence the knowledgeable person always falls </div>
<div id="t1d_154" class="t s1_154">short. </div>
