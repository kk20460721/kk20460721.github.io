<div id="t1_62" class="t s1_62">knowledge is what a buddha is: one who knows. But the knowledgeable man is not a </div>
<div id="t2_62" class="t s1_62">buddha; he does not know. He has accumulated great information, but that information </div>
<div id="t3_62" class="t s1_62">is borrowed. It is from the scriptures, from the books, from others. He has not </div>
<div id="t4_62" class="t s1_62">experienced it; it is about and about. He can talk, he can write, he can sermonize, but he </div>
<div id="t5_62" class="t s1_62">knows nothing. He talks ABOUT God; he has no idea what God is. He has no glimpse </div>
<div id="t6_62" class="t s1_62">even -- what to say about experience. </div>
<div id="t7_62" class="t s1_62">The priests all over the world of all the religions are knowledgeable people. Jesus </div>
<div id="t8_62" class="t s1_62">knows, but the pope is not a man of knowledge. He is a knowledgeable man, he has </div>
<div id="t9_62" class="t s1_62">great information. He can quote scriptures. </div>
<div id="ta_62" class="t s1_62">One of the great thinkers of the West was Ingersoll. Whenever he would deliver </div>
<div id="tb_62" class="t s1_62">discourses -- and he was a great orator too -- he would make a mysterious sign in the air </div>
<div id="tc_62" class="t s1_62">with his finger before he would start speaking. And when he would end, after that </div>
<div id="td_62" class="t s1_62">again he would make something with his fingers -- some very mysterious thing in the </div>
<div id="te_62" class="t s1_62">air. He was asked again and again, but he would laugh and he would not answer. </div>
<div id="tf_62" class="t s1_62">When he was dying somebody asked, "Now please tell us, otherwise we will be always </div>
<div id="tg_62" class="t s1_62">curious and wondering -- what were you doing your whole life? Is there some magic in </div>
<div id="th_62" class="t s1_62">it? Why do you make some mysterious signs before you speak and then again when </div>
<div id="ti_62" class="t s1_62">you end?" </div>
<div id="tj_62" class="t s1_62">He said, "There is no magic in it, but I could not tell it before. Now I can tell it. Before I </div>
<div id="tk_62" class="t s1_62">started my speech I was making the sign of inverted commas, and after I ended I had to </div>
<div id="tl_62" class="t s1_62">close the inverted commas. I was saying to myself and to you too that it is all just </div>
<div id="tm_62" class="t s1_62">quotation, it is not my experience. The whole thing is borrowed -- it is within inverted </div>
<div id="tn_62" class="t s1_62">commas." </div>
<div id="to_62" class="t s1_62">That is a knowledgeable man. But Ingersoll is sincere, at least honest. The </div>
<div id="tp_62" class="t s1_62">knowledgeable man is not better than the ignorant man, remember, Sanatan. The man </div>
<div id="tq_62" class="t s1_62">of knowledge is certainly better than the ignorant man, of course, obviously, but the </div>
<div id="tr_62" class="t s1_62">same is not true about the knowledgeable man. The knowledgeable man is even worse </div>
<div id="ts_62" class="t s1_62">than the ignorant man. The ignorant man at least knows that he is ignorant; he has no </div>
<div id="tt_62" class="t s1_62">pretensions, he has no facade. The knowledgeable man has a beautiful facade, a mask. </div>
<div id="tu_62" class="t s1_62">And the problem is: if you go on deceiving others, slowly slowly you become </div>
<div id="tv_62" class="t s1_62">autohypnotized. You start thinking that you know. But there is no difference. The </div>
<div id="tw_62" class="t s1_62">knowledgeable person is only on the surface painted with great knowledge and the </div>
<div id="tx_62" class="t s1_62">ignorant person is not painted; he is raw. The knowledgeable person is a little polished. </div>
<div id="ty_62" class="t s1_62">But deep down they are the same person. Both will be greedy, both will be full of lust, </div>
<div id="tz_62" class="t s1_62">both will be full of anger, both will be full of ego. Their lives will be nothing but ego </div>
<div id="t10_62" class="t s1_62">trips. Their lives will be nothing but sexuality, violence, greed, jealousy, possessiveness. </div>
<div id="t11_62" class="t s1_62">There will be no difference at all. </div>
<div id="t12_62" class="t s1_62">Sanatan, remember, you have to become a knower on your own. If you quote me, that is </div>
<div id="t13_62" class="t s1_62">knowledgeability; if you know it on your own, that is knowing. And knowing brings </div>
<div id="t14_62" class="t s1_62">freedom, knowing brings truth. Knowledgeability is respectable; you become an expert. </div>
<div id="t15_62" class="t s1_62">The more you know, the more people think you are great, but deep down you go on </div>
