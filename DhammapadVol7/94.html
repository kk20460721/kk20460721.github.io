<div id="t1_94" class="t s1_94">On his honeymoon, Abe was so overtaken with gratitude towards Becky, that he </div>
<div id="t2_94" class="t s1_94">wanted to give her something. Having nothing else at hand, he reached into his wallet </div>
<div id="t3_94" class="t s1_94">and gave her twenty dollars. Thereafter it became a family ritual. Each time Abe would </div>
<div id="t4_94" class="t s1_94">make love to Becky, he would give her some money, the amount varying according to </div>
<div id="t5_94" class="t s1_94">how his business was going. </div>
<div id="t6_94" class="t s1_94">Years passed, the Depression came and business got really bad. For weeks and months </div>
<div id="t7_94" class="t s1_94">Abe did not make love to Becky. Finally, in desperation, she asked, "Abe, what is the </div>
<div id="t8_94" class="t s1_94">matter? Don't you love me anymore?" </div>
<div id="t9_94" class="t s1_94">Abe told her the truth, that he was nearly bankrupt. "Don't worry, darling," she replied, </div>
<div id="ta_94" class="t s1_94">and lifting up the mattress, she revealed thousands and thousands of dollars. "All the </div>
<div id="tb_94" class="t s1_94">money you gave me, I put in the bed," she said. </div>
<div id="tc_94" class="t s1_94">"Ah," he screamed hitting his forehead, "I should have given you all my business." </div>
<div id="td_94" class="t s1_94">An unconscious man can't always be on his guard. There are moments when the secret </div>
<div id="te_94" class="t s1_94">comes out. You can deceive, but only for a time -- you cannot deceive forever, at least </div>
<div id="tf_94" class="t s1_94">not your wife. </div>
<div id="tg_94" class="t s1_94">And how can you deceive God himself? How can you deceive existence? With existence </div>
<div id="th_94" class="t s1_94">you have to be absolutely true, because before existence you are utterly naked. </div>
<div id="ti_94" class="t s1_94">Existence knows you through and through, you are transparent. It is better not to hide, </div>
<div id="tj_94" class="t s1_94">because if we don't hide, there is a possibility that we may start changing our life </div>
<div id="tk_94" class="t s1_94">patterns, our ways, our styles. </div>
<div id="tl_94" class="t s1_94">And there are only two styles: </div>
<div id="tm_94" class="t s1_94">One style is unconsciousness -- I call that the worldly style. And the other style is that of </div>
<div id="tn_94" class="t s1_94">consciousness -- my name for that style is sannyas. Sannyas simply means a committed </div>
<div id="to_94" class="t s1_94">effort to live consciously. </div>
<div id="tp_94" class="t s1_94">BUT HE WHO WEIGHS ONLY PURITY IN HIS SCALES, </div>
<div id="tq_94" class="t s1_94">WHO SEES THE NATURE OF THE TWO WORLDS, </div>
<div id="tr_94" class="t s1_94">HE IS A MASTER. </div>
<div id="ts_94" class="t s1_94">Who is a master according to Buddha? ... HE WHO WEIGHS ONLY PURITY IN HIS </div>
<div id="tt_94" class="t s1_94">SCALES. </div>
<div id="tu_94" class="t s1_94">Remember always, with Buddha purity is never a moral concept. He is not a priest, he </div>
<div id="tv_94" class="t s1_94">is not a politician. He is a man who has gone beyond all dualities -- the duality of good </div>
<div id="tw_94" class="t s1_94">and bad included. Then what can he mean by purity? By purity he always means </div>
<div id="tx_94" class="t s1_94">innocence, just like a small child who knows nothing of what is good and what is bad. </div>
<div id="ty_94" class="t s1_94">The sage also becomes a child again, but he goes beyond. The child is below the duality, </div>
<div id="tz_94" class="t s1_94">and the sage is beyond duality. One thing is similar, that both are not part of the world </div>
<div id="t10_94" class="t s1_94">of duality, of the world where everything is divided into polar opposites: good and bad, </div>
<div id="t11_94" class="t s1_94">night and day, love and hate, life and death, this world and that world, the sinner and </div>
<div id="t12_94" class="t s1_94">the saint. </div>
<div id="t13_94" class="t s1_94">The sinner is one who knows what is good and what is bad, but follows the bad. The </div>
