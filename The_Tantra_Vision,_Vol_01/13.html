<div id="t2_13" class="t s2_13">moment you become a husband or a wife, something beautiful has gone dead. It is no more alive,</div>
<div id="t3_13" class="t s2_13">the juice ﬂows no more. Now it is just pretension, hypocrisy.</div>
<div id="t4_13" class="t s2_13">Play entered his being, and through play true religion was born. His ecstasy was so infectious that</div>
<div id="t5_13" class="t s2_13">people started coming to watch him dancing and singing. And when people would come and watch,</div>
<div id="t6_13" class="t s2_13">they would start dancing, they would start singing with him. The cremation ground became a great</div>
<div id="t7_13" class="t s2_13">celebration. Yes, bodies were being burnt still, but more and more crowds started gathering around</div>
<div id="t8_13" class="t s2_13">Saraha and the arrowsmith woman, and great joy was created on that cremation ground.</div>
<div id="t9_13" class="t s2_13">And it became so infectious that people who had never heard anything about ecstasy would come,</div>
<div id="ta_13" class="t s2_13">dance and sing, and fall into ecstasy, go into Samadhi. His very vibration, his very presence, became</div>
<div id="tb_13" class="t s2_13">so potent that just if you were ready to participate with him, it would happen... contact high. Those</div>
<div id="tc_13" class="t s2_13">who came around him he was so drunk that his inner drunkenness started overﬂowing to other</div>
<div id="td_13" class="t s2_13">people. He was so stoned that others started becoming stoned and more stoned.</div>
<div id="te_13" class="t s2_13">But then the inevitable: the Brahmins and the priests and the scholars and the so-called righteous</div>
<div id="tf_13" class="t s2_13">people started vilifying and slandering him – that I call the inevitable. Whenever there is a man like</div>
<div id="tg_13" class="t s2_13">Saraha, the scholars are going to be against him, the priests are going to be against him, and the</div>
<div id="th_13" class="t s2_13">so-called moral people, puritans, self-righteous people. They started spreading absolutely unbiased</div>
<div id="ti_13" class="t s2_13">rumors about him.</div>
<div id="tj_13" class="t s2_13">They started saying to people: ”He has fallen from grace. He is a pervert. He is no more a Brahmin.</div>
<div id="tk_13" class="t s2_13">He has given up celibacy. He is no more even a Buddhist monk. He indulges in shameful practices</div>
<div id="tl_13" class="t s2_13">with a low-caste woman and runs around like a mad dog in all directions.” His ecstasy was just like</div>
<div id="tm_13" class="t s2_13">a mad dog to them – it depends how you interpret. He was dancing all over the cremation ground.</div>
<div id="tn_13" class="t s2_13">He WAS mad, but he was not a mad dog – he was a mad god!</div>
<div id="to_13" class="t s2_13">It depends on how you look.</div>
<div id="tp_13" class="t s2_13">The king also was told these things.</div>
<div id="tq_13" class="t s2_13">He was anxious to know exactly what was happening.</div>
<div id="tr_13" class="t s2_13">He</div>
<div id="ts_13" class="t s2_13">became worried; more and more people started coming to him. They knew him; they knew that the</div>
<div id="tt_13" class="t s2_13">king was always deeply respectful towards Saraha, that he wanted to appoint him as his counsellor</div>
<div id="tu_13" class="t s2_13">in the court, but Saraha had renounced the world. The king had much respect for his learning, so</div>
<div id="tv_13" class="t s2_13">they started coming to the king.</div>
<div id="tw_13" class="t s2_13">The king was worried. He had loved the young man and respected him too, and he was concerned.</div>
<div id="tx_13" class="t s2_13">So he sent a few people to persuade Saraha and tell him: ”Come back to your old ways. You are a</div>
<div id="ty_13" class="t s2_13">Brahmin, your father was a great scholar, you yourself were a great scholar – what are you doing?</div>
<div id="tz_13" class="t s2_13">You have gone astray. Come back home. I am still here! You come to the palace, be part of my</div>
<div id="t10_13" class="t s2_13">family. This is not good.”</div>
<div id="t11_13" class="t s2_13">The people went and Saraha sang one hundred and sixty verses to those people who had come</div>
<div id="t12_13" class="t s2_13">to convert him. Those one hundred and sixty verses... and those people started dancing and they</div>
<div id="t13_13" class="t s2_13">never came back!</div>
<div id="t14_13" class="t s2_13">The king was even more worried.</div>
<div id="t15_13" class="t s2_13">The king’s wife, the queen, was also always interested in the</div>
<div id="t16_13" class="t s2_13">young man. She wanted the young man to marry her daughter, so she went there. And Saraha</div>
<div id="t17_13" class="t s2_13">sang eighty verses to the queen... and she never came back.</div>
