<div id="t1_134" class="t s1_134">of his actual state. This dream might have been just a wish fulfillment, but he felt so </div>
<div id="t2_134" class="t s1_134">blessed. And all his sons were so wise, so healthy, such great warriors. </div>
<div id="t3_134" class="t s1_134">And then suddenly his son died on the bed. The wife cried so loudly that the king's </div>
<div id="t4_134" class="t s1_134">dream was shattered; he opened his eyes, looked at the dead body of his son and didn't </div>
<div id="t5_134" class="t s1_134">say a word -- remained like a statue. His wife was shocked, she shook him and said, </div>
<div id="t6_134" class="t s1_134">"Do you understand or not? Your son is dead!" The king said, "I can see it but now I am </div>
<div id="t7_134" class="t s1_134">puzzled -- for whom to cry? Just a minute before I had twelve beautiful sons, very </div>
<div id="t8_134" class="t s1_134">handsome, very wise, in every way skillful. And because of your crying my dream is </div>
<div id="t9_134" class="t s1_134">shattered, those twelve sons have disappeared; and the golden throne and the marble </div>
<div id="ta_134" class="t s1_134">palace and the great kingdom, all have gone. Should I weep for those or should I weep </div>
<div id="tb_134" class="t s1_134">for this son because when I was dreaming I had completely forgotten my son, you and </div>
<div id="tc_134" class="t s1_134">the kingdom? </div>
<div id="td_134" class="t s1_134">"Now I am awake, I have forgotten the dream and the beauties of the dream. Which is </div>
<div id="te_134" class="t s1_134">true, which should I cry for? Because when I was seeing the dream it was true, at least it </div>
<div id="tf_134" class="t s1_134">appeared to be true. Now I am seeing my dead son, it appears true, but how to decide </div>
<div id="tg_134" class="t s1_134">which appearance is really true?" </div>
<div id="th_134" class="t s1_134">Chuang Tzu, in another parable, says the same thing. He says, "Once I dreamed that I </div>
<div id="ti_134" class="t s1_134">had become a butterfly, moving from one flower to another, enjoying the sun and the </div>
<div id="tj_134" class="t s1_134">wind. And then somebody awakened me; it was morning and getting late and the sun </div>
<div id="tk_134" class="t s1_134">was shining in my face. As I opened my eyes the butterfly disappeared, I was again </div>
<div id="tl_134" class="t s1_134">Chuang Tzu. Since then I have been in confusion. The confusion is, if Chuang Tzu can </div>
<div id="tm_134" class="t s1_134">dream that he is a butterfly, why can't the butterfly dream that she is Chuang Tzu?" </div>
<div id="tn_134" class="t s1_134">He seems to be very penetrating; this puzzle is something worth meditating over. If </div>
<div id="to_134" class="t s1_134">Chuang Tzu can become a butterfly in the dream... the butterfly may have fallen asleep, </div>
<div id="tp_134" class="t s1_134">sitting on some tree, under the shade of a tree; the butterfly may have fallen into sleep </div>
<div id="tq_134" class="t s1_134">and dreamed that she is Chuang Tzu. Now who is right and what is a dream? Both </div>
<div id="tr_134" class="t s1_134">seem to be similar. </div>
<div id="ts_134" class="t s1_134">A man like Buddha knows the falseness of the whole world; he will not weep, he will </div>
<div id="tt_134" class="t s1_134">not laugh, he will not even look back. That is his way of expressing his experience of the </div>
<div id="tu_134" class="t s1_134">total. Mahavira will look back because he also has great compassion -- but different </div>
<div id="tv_134" class="t s1_134">from Jesus; he will not weep, because it helps nobody. If you weep for the world, it does </div>
<div id="tw_134" class="t s1_134">not help the world. If you weep at the stupidity of people it makes you look silly, that's </div>
<div id="tx_134" class="t s1_134">all. It does not help people. </div>
<div id="ty_134" class="t s1_134">But Lao Tzu would have certainly laughed because looking at people's absurdity, their </div>
<div id="tz_134" class="t s1_134">ridiculousness, what else can you do? Lao Tzu used to ride on a water buffalo, moving </div>
<div id="t10_134" class="t s1_134">from one place to another. He was a jolly fellow, telling jokes, telling stories to people, </div>
<div id="t11_134" class="t s1_134">always in a laughing state. </div>
<div id="t12_134" class="t s1_134">If you see the statues of Buddha that have been made in China and in Japan you will be </div>
<div id="t13_134" class="t s1_134">surprised. They don't look like Buddha, particularly not like the Indian statues, not at </div>
<div id="t14_134" class="t s1_134">all. The Indian statues have a very athletic form, Buddha has a big chest and a very </div>
<div id="t15_134" class="t s1_134">small belly, no belly at all, his body seems to be very proportionate. </div>
