<div id="t1_241" class="t s1_241">CHAPTER 21. SERIOUSNESS IS A SICKNESS</div>
<div id="t2_241" class="t s2_241">Love here is prayer. And because it is prayer, there is no jealousy. Otherwise, so many women, if</div>
<div id="t3_241" class="t s2_241">they are in love in a biological sense, will create a chaos. They will start killing each other, just out</div>
<div id="t4_241" class="t s2_241">of jealousy. But I know my people, jealousy does not touch them at all.</div>
<div id="t5_241" class="t s2_241">And it is not only the women, this harem has a speciality. It has men too. There has never been</div>
<div id="t6_241" class="t s2_241">any harem where men were also in the same love, in the same trust, with the same heart dancing,</div>
<div id="t7_241" class="t s2_241">rejoicing. But you are right, it is certainly something that has never happened before.</div>
<div id="t8_241" class="t s2_241">Although Mahavira initiated women, all his caretakers were male sannyasins, not a single woman.</div>
<div id="t9_241" class="t s2_241">I see some hidden fear somewhere.</div>
<div id="ta_241" class="t s2_241">Some repressed sexuality seems to be still lurking in the</div>
<div id="tb_241" class="t s2_241">shadows, not very strong, but he has not forgotten his past completely. At least in his mind one thing</div>
<div id="tc_241" class="t s2_241">is certain, the women can drag him down.</div>
<div id="td_241" class="t s2_241">The same was true with Gautam Buddha, although ﬁnally he had to concede.</div>
<div id="te_241" class="t s2_241">His own mother</div>
<div id="tf_241" class="t s2_241">died after his birth, and his mother’s sister never married – just to look after the child. This second</div>
<div id="tg_241" class="t s2_241">mother, Mahamaya, in her old age came to ask for initiation. He had refused for almost twenty years,</div>
<div id="th_241" class="t s2_241">hundreds of women, but he could not refuse Mahamaya. He was too much obliged to her. She had</div>
<div id="ti_241" class="t s2_241">given him more than any real mother would give. All that he was, Mahamaya had contributed to.</div>
<div id="tj_241" class="t s2_241">It was impossible to say no to her. So reluctantly he had to give her initiation into sannyas. But</div>
<div id="tk_241" class="t s2_241">once one woman had entered, he could not prevent other women; then hundreds of other women</div>
<div id="tl_241" class="t s2_241">entered.</div>
<div id="tm_241" class="t s2_241">But as far as personal staff was concerned, those who were taking care of his body, of his day, of</div>
<div id="tn_241" class="t s2_241">his food, every small detail, they were all men – not a single woman.</div>
<div id="to_241" class="t s2_241">Not even Mahamaya was</div>
<div id="tp_241" class="t s2_241">allowed. I think it is something not worth appreciating. I love Gautam Buddha, but what can I do? I</div>
<div id="tq_241" class="t s2_241">can see things which are not right. They are small things. Nobody has noticed them. For twenty-ﬁve</div>
<div id="tr_241" class="t s2_241">centuries nobody has criticized that women were not allowed. They could have cooked better. They</div>
<div id="ts_241" class="t s2_241">would have looked after him better. They could have taken care of his health better.</div>
<div id="tt_241" class="t s2_241">Every woman is a born mother. Even a small girl has the qualities of a mother. The man can do the</div>
<div id="tu_241" class="t s2_241">same things, but it doesn’t come from his inner being. There are male nurses in hospitals – not yet</div>
<div id="tv_241" class="t s2_241">in India, but in American jails I came across them. In my ﬁrst jail there were ﬁve women nurses and</div>
<div id="tw_241" class="t s2_241">one male nurse. That male nurse looked stupid.</div>
<div id="tx_241" class="t s2_241">In India the word ‘nurse’ has become feminine. We cannot conceive that a man is a nurse. He can</div>
<div id="ty_241" class="t s2_241">be a doctor, but a nurse? It seems to be cuckoo. And I saw that man who was the nurse, because</div>
<div id="tz_241" class="t s2_241">each week one day he was to take care of me. And I could see the difference. The women nurses</div>
<div id="t10_241" class="t s2_241">were making me at home even in the jail.</div>
<div id="t11_241" class="t s2_241">They were trying to bring the best clothes, they were</div>
<div id="t12_241" class="t s2_241">changing my bedsheets and my pillow covers every day, which is not done – it is usually once a</div>
<div id="t13_241" class="t s2_241">month – they were changing everything every day.</div>
<div id="t14_241" class="t s2_241">They used to go to the market specially to bring fruits and vegetables, because I would not eat the</div>
<div id="t15_241" class="t s2_241">jail food which was non-vegetarian. They would go to the market themselves and they would bring</div>
<div id="t16_241" class="t s2_241">so many fruits and so many vegetables. And I told them that I could not eat that much. But a woman</div>
<div id="t17_241" class="t s2_241">is basically a mother.</div>
<div id="t18_241" class="t s2_241">They cleaned the whole place so that I would not suffer from any smell. They had come to know</div>
<div id="t19_241" class="t s2_241">Sat Chit Anand</div>
<div id="t1a_241" class="t s2_241">241</div>
