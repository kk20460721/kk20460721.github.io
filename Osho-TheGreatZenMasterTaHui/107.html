<div id="t2_107" class="t s1_107">hurts them, their ego is wounded, to hear that there is something greater than intelligence --</div>
<div id="t3_107" class="t s1_107">meditation.</div>
<div id="t4_107" class="t s1_107">An incident happened ... I was a student, but I used to go to conferences and other places</div>
<div id="t5_107" class="t s1_107">to speak on different subjects. There was a meeting on the birthday of Nanak, the founder of</div>
<div id="t6_107" class="t s1_107">Sikhism. The president of the meeting was the chief justice of Madhya Pradesh high court,</div>
<div id="t7_107" class="t s1_107">and I was the speaker. I was just a student but this man, whose name was Ganeshwar, was a</div>
<div id="t8_107" class="t s1_107">rare man. I have never come across another man of his quality.</div>
<div id="t9_107" class="t s1_107">He was the chief justice and I was only a postgraduate student. After I spoke he simply</div>
<div id="ta_107" class="t s1_107">declared to the assembly of almost ten thousand sikhs, "Now there is nothing more to be said.</div>
<div id="tb_107" class="t s1_107">At least I cannot say anything better than has been said by this young man, so I will not deliver</div>
<div id="tc_107" class="t s1_107">the presidential address, because that may spoil what he has said to you. I would rather that</div>
<div id="td_107" class="t s1_107">you go home silently pondering over what he has said, and meditating upon it."</div>
<div id="te_107" class="t s1_107">The Sikhs were surprised, everybody was surprised, and as I was stepping down from the</div>
<div id="tf_107" class="t s1_107">podium the chief justice, Ganeshwar, touched my feet. I said, "What are you doing? You are</div>
<div id="tg_107" class="t s1_107">of the age of my father. You are a learned man, you are a brahmin."</div>
<div id="th_107" class="t s1_107">He said, "Nothing matters -- neither my being a brahmin, nor my age, nor my prestige, nor</div>
<div id="ti_107" class="t s1_107">my being the chief justice. What matters is that whatever you have said has come from the</div>
<div id="tj_107" class="t s1_107">deepest being. It was unexpected ... I have presided over many meetings and I have listened to</div>
<div id="tk_107" class="t s1_107">many learned people, but all that they say is within quotation marks. For the first time I have</div>
<div id="tl_107" class="t s1_107">heard a man who speaks directly, without any quotation marks -- who speaks on his own</div>
<div id="tm_107" class="t s1_107">authority. So don't prevent me. I am showing my gratitude by touching your feet."</div>
<div id="tn_107" class="t s1_107">The judges had come because the chief justice was presiding over the meeting, and the</div>
<div id="to_107" class="t s1_107">advocates of the high court had come because the chief justice was there -- they were all</div>
<div id="tp_107" class="t s1_107">shocked! But Ganeshwar became a regular visitor to my house. It became almost a regular</div>
<div id="tq_107" class="t s1_107">routine that his car would be standing in front of my house.</div>
<div id="tr_107" class="t s1_107">People whose cases were being heard in the high court started coming to me. I said, "I</div>
<div id="ts_107" class="t s1_107">cannot help you."</div>
<div id="tt_107" class="t s1_107">They said, "Just a word from you, and he will not do anything against it."</div>
<div id="tu_107" class="t s1_107">I said, "I cannot do any such thing. He comes here with such respect towards me that I</div>
<div id="tv_107" class="t s1_107">cannot bring up such trivia."</div>
<div id="tw_107" class="t s1_107">It became a problem. I had to keep a servant in front of my house to send these people</div>
<div id="tx_107" class="t s1_107">away, otherwise everybody was coming to the house saying, "I am in much trouble, and just a</div>
<div id="ty_107" class="t s1_107">little support from you will get me out of it."</div>
<div id="tz_107" class="t s1_107">After he retired from the chief justice-ship he became the vice-chancellor of Sagar</div>
<div id="t10_107" class="t s1_107">University. By that time I had become a professor in Jabalpur University, and I had gone to</div>
<div id="t11_107" class="t s1_107">Sagar to speak in a public conference of all religions. He heard that I had come, so he invited</div>
<div id="t12_107" class="t s1_107">me to the university where he was now the vice-chancellor.</div>
<div id="t13_107" class="t s1_107">Once I had been a student in that university, and because the vice-chancellor had called the</div>
<div id="t14_107" class="t s1_107">meeting, all the professors and all the students, everybody was present. I was worried about</div>
<div id="t15_107" class="t s1_107">only one thing -- that he may do the same act again. The professors who had taught me were</div>
<div id="t16_107" class="t s1_107">there, and thousands of students were there who had also been students, junior to me -- and he</div>
<div id="t17_107" class="t s1_107">did his act.</div>
<div id="t18_107" class="t s1_107">Chapter 8 - Delusion</div>
