<div id="t1_71" class="t s1_71">CHAPTER 6. STILL BELIEVING IN LEPRECHAUNS?</div>
<div id="t2_71" class="t s2_71">She is offended by one thing most: that people are laughing, dancing, singing – that people are alive,</div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s2_71">in short. She is very much offended that a certain climate of a ”holiday resort” is there. She must</div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s2_71">have looked for a prison, not a holiday resort. What is wrong in the ”climate of a holiday resort”?</div>
<div id="t5_71" class="t s2_71">That should be the climate of the whole earth! That should be the very climate of life itself. Life</div>
<div id="t6_71" class="t s2_71">should be a holiday. Only a holiday is a holy day.</div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s2_71">And people are working here, people are continuously working. It is not that they are just lazying</div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s2_71">around – but the climate is certainly of joy, of laughter. That offends.</div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s2_71">The whole article is obsessed with the idea that an ashram has to be ascetic, people have to be</div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s2_71">there doing yoga postures, standing on their head, doing all kinds of gymnastics, chanting mantras,</div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s2_71">doing religious rituals, and very serious – as if they are just walking corpses. Then she would have</div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s2_71">been immensely pleased. This is a ”religious” place, she would have called, a ”spiritual” place.</div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s2_71">Reading her article I decided one thing: that the new commune will not be called ashram – that word</div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s2_71">certainly is ugly. We will drop it. This is not an ashram... In a way, this is the ONLY ashram, because</div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s2_71">literally ”ashram” means rest, restfulness. But it has become associated with wrong people. We will</div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s2_71">drop it.</div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s2_71">People come with all kinds of ideas. They are miserable in their ideas, but still they are looking for</div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s2_71">the same ideas. And if they don’t ﬁnd them they don’t feel good. They are miserable and they want</div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s2_71">everybody else also to be miserable.</div>
<div id="tk_71" class="t s2_71">Just one gentleman has written to me that, ”Osho, your claim that Swami Vimalkirti attained</div>
<div id="tl_71" class="t s2_71">Buddhahood sounds phony...” As if this gentleman knows what Buddhahood is.</div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s2_71">I was very pleased with his question. I thought, ”My God, Gautam Buddha is here! Who knows</div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s2_71">what Buddhahood is and what Buddhahood is not, who knows the distinction between the authentic</div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s2_71">Buddhahood and the phony Buddhahood.” Must be a man far superior than all the Buddhas; only</div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s2_71">then you can judge.</div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s2_71">But he must have come with a certain idea. In fact, Hindus were offended by Gautam Buddha’s</div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s2_71">declaration himself, that he has become enlightened, because they had their own idea – just like</div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s2_71">this gentleman – they had their own idea. In fact, this gentleman will be surprised that Buddha’s</div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s2_71">own ﬁve disciples immediately left him, thinking that he has gone either mad or is pretending to be</div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s2_71">enlightened. His own ﬁve disciples, who had been worshipping him up to now... while he was not</div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s2_71">a Buddha they were worshipping him as their Master. And the moment he declared that he is a</div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s2_71">Buddha – it must have sounded phony – they left him immediately. And what was their argument?</div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s2_71">Their argument was that he has fallen into the trap of the ego, he has fallen from his ascetic life.</div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s2_71">Because for six years Buddha tortured himself as much as any human being has ever tortured, and</div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s2_71">found nothing by that torture... it was sheer masochistic teachings of the ages that he has been</div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s2_71">following. But he was an intelligent man, he understood. One full-moon evening, as the moon was</div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s2_71">rising, he could see the whole stupidity of what he has been doing for six years. Just by torturing</div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s2_71">your body, how you can become enlightened? What relationship exists between torturing your body,</div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s2_71">destroying your body, and Buddhahood?</div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s2_71">The Wild Geese and the Water</div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s2_71">71</div>
<div id="t16_71" class="t s3_71">Osho</div>
