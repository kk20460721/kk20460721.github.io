<div id="t2_149" class="t s1_149">your food, loved it, and you are satisfied, you will not think and dream of eating again in </div>
<div id="t3_149" class="t s1_149">the night; the dream will not come. Fast one day, and then you will have dreams of food, </div>
<div id="t4_149" class="t s1_149">beautiful, delicious food you are being invited by the Royal Family to the palace, and you </div>
<div id="t5_149" class="t s1_149">are eating and eating and eating. </div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s1_149">A dream simply indicates that which is missing in your life; that which is already there is </div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s1_149">never part of a dream. That's why an enlightened person never dreams, because he is not </div>
<div id="t8_149" class="t s1_149">missing anything. Whatsoever he wanted has happened and there is no more to it. He has </div>
<div id="t9_149" class="t s1_149">no past, no future, to interfere with the present. His present is total. Whatsoever he is </div>
<div id="ta_149" class="t s1_149">doing, he is enjoying it utterly. He is so contented that there is no need for any </div>

<div id="tg_149" class="t s1_149">That too Comes in his dreams many times; that is part of many people's dreams. A train: </div>

<div id="ti_149" class="t s1_149">platform -- and the train leaves. And his difficulty is more: his luggage is also in the train, </div>
<div id="tj_149" class="t s1_149">and he is left alone standing on the platform without any luggage. That's what has </div>
<div id="tk_149" class="t s1_149">happened to him. Nehru has gone into the train, Dinkar has gone into the train,J.P. has </div>
<div id="tl_149" class="t s1_149">gone into the train; and they have taken his luggage also and he is standing on the </div>

<div id="t11_149" class="t s1_149">rising high. He was rising higher and higher. He would have been a Chief Minister </div>
<div id="t12_149" class="t s1_149">somewhere by now, or he may have been in the Central Cabinet. He was very promising. </div>
<div id="t13_149" class="t s1_149">All those dreams disappeared. Now they go on being created and haunting him; they arc </div>
<div id="t14_149" class="t s1_149">ghosts. </div>
<div id="t15_149" class="t s1_149">He will have to recognize the fact that going back is not possible. He has reached the </div>
<div id="t16_149" class="t s1_149">point of no return. So now it is unnecessary to carry that load. Out of habit the mind goes </div>
<div id="t17_149" class="t s1_149">on carrying it. Drop it. Recognize, see deeply into it. Don't be deceived by it. </div>
