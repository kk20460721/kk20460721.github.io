<div id="t6_139" class="t s1_139">that it can drive you mad. </div>
<div id="t7_139" class="t s1_139">People don't look in. They know that it is better not to look in because it is very </div>

<div id="tb_139" class="t s1_139">not mind. Mind is nothing but accumulated thoughts, junk of the past. You are totally </div>
<div id="tc_139" class="t s1_139">different from it. </div>

<div id="tf_139" class="t s1_139">like a mirror reflecting it. And one thing will become certain: that it is separate from </div>
