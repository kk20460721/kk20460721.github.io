<div id="t1_132" class="t s1_132">CHAPTER 10. DOUBT IS A SWORD</div>
<div id="t2_132" class="t s2_132">This was a device, a double-edged sword. It was a device for the disciple to see whether he could</div>
<div id="t3_132" class="t s2_132">report exactly what happened without changing it, coloring it, interpreting it. His commentary was not</div>
<div id="t4_132" class="t s2_132">needed; he had to just be absolutely factual, a pure, detached observer, as if he was not concerned</div>
<div id="t5_132" class="t s2_132">at all.</div>
<div id="t6_132" class="t s2_132">He went there very alert, he knew that this was a kind of test. He presented the imam the book; he</div>
<div id="t7_132" class="t s2_132">was sitting in the garden. It was a winter morning and he was enjoying the sun. His wife was sitting</div>
<div id="t8_132" class="t s2_132">there.</div>
<div id="t9_132" class="t s2_132">When he presented the book, the imam asked, ”Who has written this?”</div>
<div id="ta_132" class="t s2_132">He told his Master’s name. The imam suddenly became so enraged that he threw the book outside</div>
<div id="tb_132" class="t s2_132">the gate and said, ”This type of nonsense, this type of outrageous, irreligious, sacrilegious thing</div>
<div id="tc_132" class="t s2_132">cannot enter into my house! Get out immediately and never come here again! Your Master is a</div>
<div id="td_132" class="t s2_132">danger to the society. He is creating chaos, he is destroying our religion!”</div>
<div id="te_132" class="t s2_132">For a moment the disciple was losing his detachment, because great anger was arising in him, but</div>
<div id="tf_132" class="t s2_132">he remembered that the Master had said that he had to be just a reporter; he had not to bring his</div>
<div id="tg_132" class="t s2_132">emotions in, his sentiments in.</div>
<div id="th_132" class="t s2_132">Just when he was leaving, the wife of the imam said, ”You could have thrown it out a little later on</div>
<div id="ti_132" class="t s2_132">when the man had gone. There was no need to be so enraged – it doesn’t ﬁt you, your status. Or,</div>
<div id="tj_132" class="t s2_132">you have such a big library in which there are all kinds of books – you could have put that book there</div>
<div id="tk_132" class="t s2_132">also. If you don’t want to read it there is no need to read it. And I have seen all kinds of books –</div>
<div id="tl_132" class="t s2_132">religious, irreligious, belonging to our religion, belonging to other religions – in your library, so why</div>
<div id="tm_132" class="t s2_132">can’t this book also be a part of the library?”</div>
<div id="tn_132" class="t s2_132">Again the disciple felt an emotion arising, that the woman was more compassionate, more loving,</div>
<div id="to_132" class="t s2_132">more human. But suddenly he became aware that he had not to bring his attitude into it at all; he had</div>
<div id="tp_132" class="t s2_132">just to report. He came back and he just reported, but when he was reporting, at the last moment</div>
<div id="tq_132" class="t s2_132">he forgot and he said, ”One thing I must say, that the imam’s wife is a very nice, beautiful woman,</div>
<div id="tr_132" class="t s2_132">and she even seems to understand you. Maybe one day she can be converted to your path.”</div>
<div id="ts_132" class="t s2_132">The Master said, ”Wait! Who has asked about your commentary, about your interpretation? You</div>
<div id="tt_132" class="t s2_132">should simply report. And as far as your commentary is concerned, it is absolutely wrong. If you</div>
<div id="tu_132" class="t s2_132">ask me, then I will say this imam is sooner or later going to be trapped by me, but his wife will never</div>
<div id="tv_132" class="t s2_132">be a part of our commune, NEVER, because his wife is indifferent. She says, ’YOU can put it in the</div>
<div id="tw_132" class="t s2_132">library.’ The imam HATES me – hate can be transformed into love – but the wife is just indifferent:</div>
<div id="tx_132" class="t s2_132">she does not love me, she does not hate me. She is not interested in me at all. She says, ’There is</div>
<div id="ty_132" class="t s2_132">no need to throw it out.’ But the way the imam became enraged shows his emotion; soon he will feel</div>
<div id="tz_132" class="t s2_132">that it was not right. And I tell you: go again and see what has happened to the book – the imam</div>
<div id="t10_132" class="t s2_132">must have taken it back into his home, he must be reading it now. A man who becomes so enraged</div>
<div id="t11_132" class="t s2_132">is already interested. He cannot avoid reading it – he HAS to read it.”</div>
<div id="t12_132" class="t s2_132">And the disciple went again. And wonder of wonders! The Master was right: the imam was reading</div>
<div id="t13_132" class="t s2_132">the book</div>
<div id="t14_132" class="t s2_132">....</div>
<div id="t15_132" class="t s2_132">Guida Spirituale</div>
<div id="t16_132" class="t s2_132">132</div>
<div id="t17_132" class="t s3_132">Osho</div>
