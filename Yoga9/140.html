<div id="t2_140" class="t s1_140">create. Drop as many as possible. The fewer problems you have, the better, because then, </div>
<div id="t3_140" class="t s1_140">if you cannot drop those few, if they are not really because of your attitude but are </div>
<div id="t4_140" class="t s1_140">intrinsic to life; then they can be solved. </div>
<div id="t5_140" class="t s1_140">I have heard, one man went to his psychiatrist: </div>
<div id="t6_140" class="t s1_140">The poor man had big bags under his eyes; he looked very tired. "I dream every single </div>
<div id="t7_140" class="t s1_140">night, doctor," he told his physician. "Last night it was terrible! I was in a big plane, I had </div>
<div id="t8_140" class="t s1_140">my parachute on, we were climbing up to forty thousand feet from where I was going to </div>
<div id="t9_140" class="t s1_140">jump to establish a new altitude record. We got to forty thousand feet -- I opened the door </div>
<div id="ta_140" class="t s1_140">-- I took one step forward -- I pulled the rip cord -- what do you think happened?" </div>
<div id="tb_140" class="t s1_140">The doctor said, "I have no idea." </div>
<div id="tc_140" class="t s1_140">The man said, "My pajamas fell down!" </div>
<div id="td_140" class="t s1_140">Now is this a problem? When you are forty thousand feet above the earth, is this a </div>
<div id="te_140" class="t s1_140">problem? The whole life is at stake? And that too in a dream! </div>
<div id="tf_140" class="t s1_140">And one is feeling tired. I have heard, on a park bench two beggars were sitting and </div>
<div id="tg_140" class="t s1_140">talking. I was just passing by. One beggar said, "I dreamt that I got a good job." The other </div>
<div id="th_140" class="t s1_140">said, "Yes, you look tired." </div>
<div id="ti_140" class="t s1_140">Drop nonsense. Sex is not a problem. Sex is your life energy. Accept it. If you accept, it </div>
<div id="tj_140" class="t s1_140">can be transformed. If you reject, you will be in a mess. If you fight with it, with whom </div>
<div id="tk_140" class="t s1_140">are you fighting? Just think: with yourself -- half/half, divided. You are fighting with </div>
<div id="tl_140" class="t s1_140">yourself; of course you will be more and more crippled. Never fight with yourself. </div>
<div id="tm_140" class="t s1_140">Sadhana is not a conflict, it is not a struggle. Sadhana is a deep understanding, a </div>
<div id="tn_140" class="t s1_140">transformation, an awareness, in which you start loving, accepting yourself, and getting </div>
<div id="to_140" class="t s1_140">higher and higher -- through understanding. Nothing is tO be excluded from your being. </div>
<div id="tp_140" class="t s1_140">Everything is as it should be. It has to be used for a higher harmony, that's all. The veena </div>
<div id="tq_140" class="t s1_140">is not to be thrown. If you cannot play it, learn how to play. Nothing is wrong with the </div>
<div id="tr_140" class="t s1_140">veena. If you cannot play and you do play on the veena, of course you create mad noise. </div>
<div id="ts_140" class="t s1_140">The neighbors will go and report you to the police station. Your wife will immediately </div>
<div id="tt_140" class="t s1_140">give you a divorce. Your children will become nervous. And you yourself will be in a </div>
<div id="tu_140" class="t s1_140">mess because if you don't know how to play a veena, how to play on a musical </div>
<div id="tv_140" class="t s1_140">instrument, hmm? you will get more and more discordant in yourself </div>
<div id="tw_140" class="t s1_140">But nothing is wrong with the veena, remember. You don't know how to play it. </div>
<div id="tx_140" class="t s1_140">Sex energy is a tremendous energy. You don't know how to play with it. And you have </div>
<div id="ty_140" class="t s1_140">been taught for centuries to be against it. Just see what yom religious people have done to </div>
<div id="tz_140" class="t s1_140">the world. They have been teaching against sex and sex becomes more and more </div>
<div id="t10_140" class="t s1_140">important because of their teachings. The whole world is almost neurotically sexual. A </div>
<div id="t11_140" class="t s1_140">few are indulging in it as if there is nothing else in life, and a few are escaping from it as </div>
<div id="t12_140" class="t s1_140">if there is nothing else in life. A few are just escaping and a few are just fighting. Both </div>
<div id="t13_140" class="t s1_140">are wasting their lives. </div>
<div id="t14_140" class="t s1_140">This is some great energy, a gift of God. Many treasures are hidden in it. It has to be </div>
<div id="t15_140" class="t s1_140">learned, the book has to be opened, one has to go into it, it has to be studied deeply, </div>
<div id="t16_140" class="t s1_140">understood deeply. The key of infinite life is there. </div>
<div id="t17_140" class="t s1_140">Now that you have come to me, I go on insisting for understanding. A certain intellectual </div>
<div id="t18_140" class="t s1_140">understanding arises. But the old conditioning goes on and on. It is not that only in this </div>
