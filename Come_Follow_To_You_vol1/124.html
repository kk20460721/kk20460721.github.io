<div id="t2_124" class="t s1_124">have accepted it so deeply that they have become insensitive to it. They are </div>
<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">almost dead: they drift, they are not alive. </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">This happened because of the tyranny of trust. How can a bird fly with one </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">wing? </div>
<div id="t6_124" class="t s1_124">Now in the West, another tyranny is happening: the tyranny of doubt. It works </div>
<div id="t7_124" class="t s1_124">perfectly well as far as Objective inquiry is concerned: you think about matter, </div>
<div id="t8_124" class="t s1_124">doubt is needed; it is a scientific method. But when you start moving within-</div>
<div id="t9_124" class="t s1_124">wards it simply doesn't work; it doesn't fit. There, trust is needed. </div>
<div id="ta_124" class="t s1_124">The perfect man is a man who has a deep harmony between doubt and trust. A </div>
<div id="tb_124" class="t s1_124">perfect man will look inconsistent to you, but he is not inconsistent. He is simply </div>
<div id="tc_124" class="t s1_124">harmonious -- contradictions dissolve in him. He uses everything. </div>
<div id="td_124" class="t s1_124">If you have doubt, use it for scientific inquiry. And look at great scientists: by the </div>

<div id="tf_124" class="t s1_124">youthful enthusiasm is gone and wisdom settles, they are always very deep in </div>

<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">religious. They trust because they have known doubt, they have used doubt, and </div>
<div id="tj_124" class="t s1_124">they have come to understand that doubt has its limitations. </div>
<div id="tk_124" class="t s1_124">It is just like: my eyes can see and my ears can hear. If I try to hear from my eyes </div>
<div id="tl_124" class="t s1_124">then it is going to be impossible, and if I try to see by my ears then it is going to </div>
<div id="tm_124" class="t s1_124">be impossible. The eye has its own limitation, the ear has its own limitation. They </div>

<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">energy becomes sight, and the whole energy in the ear becomes hearing. </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">Doubt is an expert. It works if you are inquiring about the world. But when you </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">start inquiring about God through the same method, then you are using a wrong </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">method. The method was perfectly suited to the world, to the world of law, but it </div>
<div id="tu_124" class="t s1_124">is not suited to the world of love. For the world of love, trust is needed. </div>

<div id="ty_124" class="t s1_124">become doubtful of doubt. You will see where it works and where it doesn't </div>
<div id="tz_124" class="t s1_124">work. When you come to that understanding, the door of trust opens. </div>

<div id="t16_124" class="t s1_124">part which cannot be divided any more. And religion comes to God: it goes on </div>
<div id="t17_124" class="t s1_124">adding, synthesizing. God is the ultimate synthesis; more cannot be added to it. </div>
