<div id="t1_92" class="t s1_92">CHAPTER 7. ON THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE</div>
<div id="t2_92" class="t s2_92">He resisted the urge, it was dangerous, the forest was ﬁlled with wild animals and there was no</div>
<div id="t3_92" class="t s2_92">point in going into it because he had to reach the other village by the morning, and half the journey</div>
<div id="t4_92" class="t s2_92">was yet incomplete. For what should he go into the forest? But it was as if something had started</div>
<div id="t5_92" class="t s2_92">pulling him, he was helpless, he could not do anything. He started running into the forest as if mad</div>
<div id="t6_92" class="t s2_92">and sometimes he would think: What am I doing? But the body was moving on its own, he was no</div>
<div id="t7_92" class="t s2_92">more the master. He wanted to escape, it was absolutely dangerous, he was afraid, trembling – but</div>
<div id="t8_92" class="t s2_92">helpless. But when he reached near the grove, then he understood.</div>
<div id="t9_92" class="t s2_92">A subtle call was coming from the grove: Come to me! It was not audible to the outer ears, but</div>
<div id="ta_92" class="t s2_92">something in him could hear it. And the grove was unbelievable! The whole forest was ﬁlled with</div>
<div id="tb_92" class="t s2_92">darkness but the grove was glowing with a subtle blue light. It was almost as if it was of another</div>
<div id="tc_92" class="t s2_92">world, as if a buddha was sitting underneath the trees, as if somebody had become enlightened</div>
<div id="td_92" class="t s2_92">underneath them, and the light of enlightenment and the peace and bliss of nirvana was spreading</div>
<div id="te_92" class="t s2_92">all around. He felt subtle ripples all around the grove – a magnetic ﬁeld. Now the fear disappeared.</div>
<div id="tf_92" class="t s2_92">He entered the grove, and just by entering, he was transformed, he became totally a new person.</div>
<div id="tg_92" class="t s2_92">He could not believe himself: he was just an ordinary man, neither particularly good nor particularly</div>
<div id="th_92" class="t s2_92">bad, just an ordinary plain man.</div>
<div id="ti_92" class="t s2_92">Deep in the confusions of ordinary life, deep in the troubles of ordinary life, neither a theist nor an</div>
<div id="tj_92" class="t s2_92">atheist...</div>
<div id="tk_92" class="t s2_92">in fact he had never thought about God in particular, he had never taken any decision</div>
<div id="tl_92" class="t s2_92">about religion, he had been really indifferent to it. Life had so many problems and he was very much</div>
<div id="tm_92" class="t s2_92">in it... but suddenly, entering the grove, he was caught in a whirlwind. He sat underneath the tree,</div>
<div id="tn_92" class="t s2_92">and he couldn’t believe it – he had never used this posture before, he was sitting like a Suﬁ Dervish.</div>
<div id="to_92" class="t s2_92">And then a stirring started in his being – the innermost core of his being was stirred, and a sound</div>
<div id="tp_92" class="t s2_92">started rising. He couldn’t believe what was happening, it was unbelievable. Then a sound burst</div>
<div id="tq_92" class="t s2_92">upon him which he could not recognize, but by and by as things settled and the excitement was</div>
<div id="tr_92" class="t s2_92">gone, he could hear the sound, the nebulous sound became clear; the formless took the form and</div>
<div id="ts_92" class="t s2_92">now he could hear – it was nothing but ’Allah, Allah’, and he was repeating it in spite of himself. He</div>
<div id="tt_92" class="t s2_92">was not doing it, he was not the doer, he could only bear witness to it – it was happening.</div>
<div id="tu_92" class="t s2_92">It was as if he was just the shore of some cosmic ocean and tidal waves were coming and splashing</div>
<div id="tv_92" class="t s2_92">all over him – ’Allah, Allah, Allah’ – a tide of the ocean shattering on the shore; he was just the shore.</div>
<div id="tw_92" class="t s2_92">Bathed, transmuted, a million times he died and was reborn in that night.</div>
<div id="tx_92" class="t s2_92">For eighteen years the dervish had remained there and nothing had happened, and in eighteen</div>
<div id="ty_92" class="t s2_92">hours the beggar was a Buddha – and he had not done a thing. I love the story. Lao Tzu would have</div>
<div id="tz_92" class="t s2_92">loved it, Lao Tzu would have understood it. What is the secret of this? It looks a little irrational: the</div>
<div id="t10_92" class="t s2_92">man who had been praying for eighteen years attained nothing and the man who had never prayed</div>
<div id="t11_92" class="t s2_92">attained everything within eighteen hours. What is the secret key to understand this story?</div>
<div id="t12_92" class="t s2_92">Lao Tzu has a word. The word is wu wei. It means: action without action. It means: action like</div>
<div id="t13_92" class="t s2_92">no-action. It means: being active and not being active together. That is the secret key. The dervish</div>
<div id="t14_92" class="t s2_92">was overdoing it; he could not maintain himself in the middle. He overdid it, and overdoing is always</div>
<div id="t15_92" class="t s2_92">undoing.</div>
<div id="t16_92" class="t s2_92">Life is a balance, and he couldn’t attain to a balance. In his greed to attain, in his ambition to attain,</div>
<div id="t17_92" class="t s2_92">he moved to the extreme and became too active. And whenever you are too active, whenever you</div>
