<div id="t2_111" class="t s1_111">perverted, but they are hiding their perversion in such terms that you cannot see the point. </div>
<div id="t3_111" class="t s1_111">There is a fable from Aesop: </div>
<div id="t4_111" class="t s1_111">A fox is trying to jump to get grapes. They are ripe and alluring, and their smell is </div>
<div id="t5_111" class="t s1_111">making the fox almost crazy, but the bunch of grapes is too far away. The fox tries and </div>
<div id="t6_111" class="t s1_111">tries, fails, cannot reach; then she looks around -- has somebody seen the failure? </div>
<div id="t7_111" class="t s1_111">A small hare is hiding under a bush, and he says, "Auntie, what has happened? You </div>
<div id="t8_111" class="t s1_111">couldn't reach them?" </div>
<div id="t9_111" class="t s1_111">She says, "No, that's not the point. The grapes are not ripe yet; they are sour." </div>
<div id="ta_111" class="t s1_111">This is what you have known as religion up to now -- "The grapes are sour" -- because </div>
<div id="tb_111" class="t s1_111">these people could not get to them, could not reach them. These people were failures. </div>
<div id="tc_111" class="t s1_111">Religion has nothing to do with failure. It is a fulfillment, a fruition, a flowering, a </div>
<div id="td_111" class="t s1_111">climax, a peak. Abraham Maslow is right when he says that religion is concerned with </div>
<div id="te_111" class="t s1_111">"peak experiences. </div>
<div id="tf_111" class="t s1_111">But look at your religious people in the churches, in the monasteries, in the temples: fed </div>
<div id="tg_111" class="t s1_111">up, bored, long faces, just waiting for death to come and "deliver" them. Antilife, against </div>
<div id="th_111" class="t s1_111">life, fanatically against life; and wherever they see any sign of life, they jump upon it to </div>
<div id="ti_111" class="t s1_111">kill and destroy it. They will not allow you to laugh in the church, they will not allow you </div>
<div id="tj_111" class="t s1_111">to dance in the church, because any sign of life and they become troubled -- because any </div>
<div id="tk_111" class="t s1_111">sign of life and they become aware that they have missed it, they could not reach it. </div>
<div id="tl_111" class="t s1_111">Religion is not for the failures. It is for those who have succeeded in life, who have lived </div>
<div id="tm_111" class="t s1_111">life to its deepest core, to its depth and height, in all dimensions, and who have become </div>
<div id="tn_111" class="t s1_111">so enriched by the experience that they are ready to transcend it. These people will never </div>
<div id="to_111" class="t s1_111">be antilife; they will be life-affirmative. They will say life is divine. In fact they will say, </div>
<div id="tp_111" class="t s1_111">"Forget all about God. Life is God." They will not be against love, because love is the </div>
<div id="tq_111" class="t s1_111">very juice of life. They will say, "Love is like blood circulating in the divine body of </div>
<div id="tr_111" class="t s1_111">God." Love is to life exactly as blood is to your body. How can they be against it? </div>
<div id="ts_111" class="t s1_111">If you become antilove, you start shrinking. A really religious person is expanding, </div>
<div id="tt_111" class="t s1_111">expanding. It is an expansion of consciousness, not a shrinking. </div>
<div id="tu_111" class="t s1_111">In India we have called the ultimate truth brahman. The word "brahman" means "who </div>
<div id="tv_111" class="t s1_111">goes on expanding" -- on and on and on, and knows no end. The very word is beautiful, </div>
<div id="tw_111" class="t s1_111">has a tremendous significance. This ongoing expansion, this endless expansion of life, </div>
<div id="tx_111" class="t s1_111">love, consciousness, this is what God is. </div>
<div id="ty_111" class="t s1_111">Beware, because the life-negative religion is very cheap; you can get it by just being </div>
<div id="tz_111" class="t s1_111">bored. It is very cheap because you can get it just by being a failure, just by being </div>
<div id="t10_111" class="t s1_111">uncreative, just by being lazy, desperate, sad. It is really cheap. But real religion, </div>
<div id="t11_111" class="t s1_111">authentic religion, is at a great cost: you have to lose yourself in life. You have to pay the </div>
<div id="t12_111" class="t s1_111">cost. It is earned, and it is earned the hard way. One has to move through life, to know its </div>
<div id="t13_111" class="t s1_111">sadnesses, its happinesses, to know its failures, its successes, to know sunny days and </div>
<div id="t14_111" class="t s1_111">cloudy ones, to know poverty and richness, to know love and to know hate -- to touch the </div>
<div id="t15_111" class="t s1_111">very rock bottom of life, the hell, and to soar high and touch the highest peak, heaven. </div>
<div id="t16_111" class="t s1_111">One has to move in all the directions, in all the dimensions; nothing should remain </div>
<div id="t17_111" class="t s1_111">covered. Religion is a discovery; it is to unveil life. </div>
<div id="t18_111" class="t s1_111">And of course pain is part of it. Never think only in terms of pleasure; otherwise soon you </div>
<div id="t19_111" class="t s1_111">will get out of life, out of touch. Life is both pain and pleasure. In fact it will be better to </div>
<div id="t1a_111" class="t s1_111">call it "pain-pleasure"; even "and" is not good, because that divides. Pain-pleasure, hell-</div>
