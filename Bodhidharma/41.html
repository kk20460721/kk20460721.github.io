<div id="t1_41" class="t s1_41">country, translated his own book of poems, GITANJALI, into English. Although </div>
<div id="t2_41" class="t s1_41">he was educated in England ...he belonged to a very super-rich family of Bengal; </div>
<div id="t3_41" class="t s1_41">his grandfather was given the title of king by the British empire. </div>
<div id="t4_41" class="t s1_41">He had all the best education possible in the world, but still a mother tongue is a </div>
<div id="t5_41" class="t s1_41">mother tongue. He had written all his poems in Bengali, but a few friends </div>
<div id="t6_41" class="t s1_41">suggested that GITANJALI has such a grandeur that if it is translated into </div>
<div id="t7_41" class="t s1_41">English there is every possibility of it getting a Nobel prize. But who should </div>
<div id="t8_41" class="t s1_41">translate it except Rabindranath himself? Who could be a better translator? </div>
<div id="t9_41" class="t s1_41">So he translated it, but he was still hesitant. He asked a great Christian </div>
<div id="ta_41" class="t s1_41">missionary of those days, C.F. Andrews -- a great scholar and very influential, a </div>
<div id="tb_41" class="t s1_41">world famous figure -- to go through the translations because he could also </div>
<div id="tc_41" class="t s1_41">understand Bengali. He was living in Bengal as a missionary; he was working </div>
<div id="td_41" class="t s1_41">amongst Bengalis and had learned their language. So he was the right person to </div>
<div id="te_41" class="t s1_41">go through the translation and to look at the original. He approved the whole </div>
<div id="tf_41" class="t s1_41">book except at four points, just four words scattered through the book. He said, </div>
<div id="tg_41" class="t s1_41">"They are not grammatically correct, and I would suggest different words </div>
<div id="th_41" class="t s1_41">meaning almost the same, but grammatically correct." </div>
<div id="ti_41" class="t s1_41">And Rabindranath was convinced that C.F. Andrews was right as far as </div>
<div id="tj_41" class="t s1_41">language was concerned. So he changed those four words and replaced them </div>
<div id="tk_41" class="t s1_41">with the words suggested by C.F. Andrews. In England he had friends among all </div>
<div id="tl_41" class="t s1_41">the English poets, so he went to London where he was a guest of one of the great </div>
<div id="tm_41" class="t s1_41">poets of those days, Yeats. And Yeats called a meeting of only English poets to </div>
<div id="tn_41" class="t s1_41">listen to the recitation of Rabindranath's GITANJALI. He was convinced that the </div>
<div id="to_41" class="t s1_41">book was so rare and so unique that it could be proposed for a Nobel prize, but it </div>
<div id="tp_41" class="t s1_41">would be good to have the opinion of many Nobel prize winning poets. </div>
<div id="tq_41" class="t s1_41">So nearabout twenty or twenty-five poets gathered in Yeats' house to listen to </div>
<div id="tr_41" class="t s1_41">Rabindranath's recitation. They were all immensely impressed, and unanimously </div>
<div id="ts_41" class="t s1_41">they wanted to make an appeal to the Nobel prize committee that the book </div>
<div id="tt_41" class="t s1_41">should be honored by a Nobel prize. But Yeats himself had a little reservation. </div>
<div id="tu_41" class="t s1_41">He said, "Everything is perfectly right, except for four words." Rabindranath </div>
<div id="tv_41" class="t s1_41">could not believe it -- these were exactly the four words that C.F. Andrews had </div>
<div id="tw_41" class="t s1_41">suggested! </div>
<div id="tx_41" class="t s1_41">Yeats said, "They are perfectly grammatical, but they are not poetic. They look as </div>
<div id="ty_41" class="t s1_41">if somebody else has interfered; they prevent the flow of poetic beauty. Rather </div>
<div id="tz_41" class="t s1_41">than being a help, they are hindrances and I would suggest that you change </div>
<div id="t10_41" class="t s1_41">these words. </div>
<div id="t11_41" class="t s1_41">"Where did you get them? Because I have every certainty in my being that they </div>
<div id="t12_41" class="t s1_41">are not your words. No poet can use those words in the places where they have </div>
<div id="t13_41" class="t s1_41">been used. A linguist, yes; a man who wants to be perfect in grammar and </div>
<div id="t14_41" class="t s1_41">language will use them. But a poet has a certain freedom; he has a poetic license </div>
<div id="t15_41" class="t s1_41">to go a little off the track with grammar because poetry is a higher value than </div>
<div id="t16_41" class="t s1_41">prose. For prose, grammar is okay, but for poetry, grammar can be a </div>
<div id="t17_41" class="t s1_41">disturbance." </div>
