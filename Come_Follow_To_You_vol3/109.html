<div id="t1_109" class="t s1_109">and it can be meditative; and you can just take a shower and it can be meditative. </div>
<div id="t2_109" class="t s1_109">Try to understand this. </div>
<div id="t3_109" class="t s1_109">Meditation should become a climate around you, a milieu in which you live. And </div>
<div id="t4_109" class="t s1_109">wherever you go, you carry your climate. This is my whole effort: that's why I </div>
<div id="t5_109" class="t s1_109">don't send you to isolation, I don't send you to mountains so that you can </div>
<div id="t6_109" class="t s1_109">meditate the whole day; because that would give you a wrong notion about it, </div>
<div id="t7_109" class="t s1_109">the notion of quantity. </div>
<div id="t8_109" class="t s1_109">GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER WITHOUT DISTRACTION: you can never go </div>
<div id="t9_109" class="t s1_109">deeper and deeper if you don't understand what distraction is. If you are trying </div>
<div id="ta_109" class="t s1_109">to avoid distraction, you can never go deeper; because wherever you are, the </div>
<div id="tb_109" class="t s1_109">distraction will follow you -- because it is in you. </div>
<div id="tc_109" class="t s1_109">I will tell you one story: One man was very much distracted by his wife, because </div>
<div id="td_109" class="t s1_109">whenever he meditated the wife would talk loudly, or walk and close doors so </div>
<div id="te_109" class="t s1_109">loudly that plates would start falling; and he was very much distracted. So he left </div>
<div id="tf_109" class="t s1_109">the house. He went into a forest. But then animals and crows started distracting </div>
<div id="tg_109" class="t s1_109">him. Sometimes it was also happening that there was no distraction -- then this </div>
<div id="th_109" class="t s1_109">would become the distraction. What is the matter? -- there is no distraction. </div>
<div id="ti_109" class="t s1_109">Absolute silence, and he would be distracted: what is happening? Have all the </div>
<div id="tj_109" class="t s1_109">animals and the birds disappeared? Distraction is not something objective, not </div>
<div id="tk_109" class="t s1_109">there outside you; it is something in you. If you cannot accept, you will be </div>
<div id="tl_109" class="t s1_109">distracted; if you accept, distraction disappears. </div>
<div id="tm_109" class="t s1_109">Once it happened: I was staying in a rest-house. And a political leader was also </div>
<div id="tn_109" class="t s1_109">staying there -- a very small rest-house in a very small village. The political </div>
<div id="to_109" class="t s1_109">leader came to me in the middle of the night, and said, "It is impossible to sleep. </div>
<div id="tp_109" class="t s1_109">How are you sleeping?" He shook me, and said, "How are you sleeping, there is </div>
<div id="tq_109" class="t s1_109">so much distraction?" </div>
<div id="tr_109" class="t s1_109">Somehow or other at least two dozen dogs... they must have made the rest-house </div>
<div id="ts_109" class="t s1_109">their abode -- the whole village's dogs. Maybe they were having a political </div>
<div id="tt_109" class="t s1_109">gathering also -- and they were so many; there was such a loud barking and </div>
<div id="tu_109" class="t s1_109">fighting. </div>
<div id="tv_109" class="t s1_109">He said, "But how are you sleeping? These dogs won't allow me to sleep, and I </div>
<div id="tw_109" class="t s1_109">am tired." </div>
<div id="tx_109" class="t s1_109">So I said to the political leader, "But they are not aware of you. They don't read </div>
<div id="ty_109" class="t s1_109">newspapers, they don't listen to the radio, they don't look at television; they are </div>
<div id="tz_109" class="t s1_109">not aware of you. I was also here before you. That is their usual way: they are not </div>
<div id="t10_109" class="t s1_109">doing it specially for you. You are fighting, resisting. The notion that they are </div>
<div id="t11_109" class="t s1_109">disturbing you is disturbing you; not they. Accept them" I told him to do one </div>
<div id="t12_109" class="t s1_109">small meditation. "Lie down on the bed. Enjoy their barking. Let it be a music. </div>
<div id="t13_109" class="t s1_109">Enjoy it. Listen to it, as attentively as possible." </div>
<div id="t14_109" class="t s1_109">He said, "How is it going to help me? I want to avoid, I want to forget that they </div>
<div id="t15_109" class="t s1_109">are there, and you are telling me to listen to them. That will disturb me even </div>
<div id="t16_109" class="t s1_109">more." </div>
