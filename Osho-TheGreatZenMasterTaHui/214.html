<div id="t1_214" class="t s1_214">Just here in Poona, some twenty years ago, a young man who was a professor in the</div>
<div id="t2_214" class="t s1_214">university came to see me. He wanted a private interview; he did not want to say anything</div>
<div id="t3_214" class="t s1_214">about his problem before others. And later on, naturally I understood that it must have been</div>
<div id="t4_214" class="t s1_214">embarrassing for him to say it before others. He had from his very childhood learned the habit</div>
<div id="t5_214" class="t s1_214">-- which is very strange, because a man's physiology does not allow it -- of walking like a</div>
<div id="t6_214" class="t s1_214">woman.</div>
<div id="t7_214" class="t s1_214">A man cannot walk like a woman for the simple reason that he does not have a womb. It is</div>
<div id="t8_214" class="t s1_214">the womb in the woman's body that makes her walk differently; without the womb, nobody</div>
<div id="t9_214" class="t s1_214">can manage it. But something must have happened in his childhood of which he was not</div>
<div id="ta_214" class="t s1_214">aware. Perhaps he was born in a house where there were only girls -- his sisters -- and he was</div>
<div id="tb_214" class="t s1_214">the only boy. And naturally, children learn from imitation: if he was surrounded only by girls,</div>
<div id="tc_214" class="t s1_214">he may have started moving the way they were moving and become almost fixated on it.</div>
<div id="td_214" class="t s1_214">Everybody was laughing at him, and particularly that he is a professor in the university,</div>
<div id="te_214" class="t s1_214">and walking like a woman, and all the students laughing ... He had been to doctors, but they</div>
<div id="tf_214" class="t s1_214">said, "What can we do? -- there is no disease, no medicine can help. There is nothing wrong in</div>
<div id="tg_214" class="t s1_214">your body. No operation can help."</div>
<div id="th_214" class="t s1_214">He had been to psychoanalysts in Bombay and New Delhi and they were also unbelieving,</div>
<div id="ti_214" class="t s1_214">because such a case had never come to them. So none of the advice they could give was the</div>
<div id="tj_214" class="t s1_214">advice of psychoanalysis -- because psychoanalysis has no precedent for such a case. In all the</div>
<div id="tk_214" class="t s1_214">discoveries of psychoanalysis, I have never come across a single case like this that has been</div>
<div id="tl_214" class="t s1_214">treated by psychoanalysts.</div>
<div id="tm_214" class="t s1_214">So naturally ... the man was a psychoanalyst, but the advice he was giving was just</div>
<div id="tn_214" class="t s1_214">commonplace advice. He said, "You have to try hard to walk like a man. Be alert." This is</div>
<div id="to_214" class="t s1_214">commonsense advice. "What can be done? You have to change your habit and create a new</div>
<div id="tp_214" class="t s1_214">habit. So particularly when you go for a morning walk, or an evening walk, try hard to walk</div>
<div id="tq_214" class="t s1_214">like a man."</div>
<div id="tr_214" class="t s1_214">And that created the trouble: the more he tried to walk like a man, the more his mind was</div>
<div id="ts_214" class="t s1_214">getting hypnotized to walk like a woman. That was why he was trying ... otherwise nobody</div>
<div id="tt_214" class="t s1_214">tries. Have you ever tried not to walk like a woman?</div>
<div id="tu_214" class="t s1_214">But if you are so consciously trying hard to walk like a man, you don't understand the</div>
<div id="tv_214" class="t s1_214">mechanism of hypnosis: you are hypnotizing yourself more to walk like a woman. You are</div>
<div id="tw_214" class="t s1_214">trying hard and you are failing, and every failure is making your autohypnotic situation</div>
<div id="tx_214" class="t s1_214">deeper. So all the advice of great psychoanalysts turned him into even more of a mess. He</div>
<div id="ty_214" class="t s1_214">started walking more like a woman than he had before.</div>
<div id="tz_214" class="t s1_214">When he came to see me, a few friends were there and he said, "I cannot tell you my</div>
<div id="t10_214" class="t s1_214">problem. I want absolute privacy."</div>
<div id="t11_214" class="t s1_214">So I said, "Okay, you can come into my room." I took him into my room, and he locked</div>
<div id="t12_214" class="t s1_214">the door. I said, "What kind of problem do you have that you are so much afraid?"</div>
<div id="t13_214" class="t s1_214">He said "It is so embarrassing ... I walk like a woman."</div>
<div id="t14_214" class="t s1_214">I said, "You should not be embarrassed about it. In fact, you have done a miracle.</div>
<div id="t15_214" class="t s1_214">Physiologists cannot believe that it is possible: walking like a woman needs a womb,</div>
<div id="t16_214" class="t s1_214">otherwise you cannot. And you don't have a womb ..."</div>
<div id="t17_214" class="t s1_214">He said, "Whatever may be the case ..."</div>
<div id="t18_214" class="t s1_214">Chapter 17 - No goal</div>
<div id="t19_214" class="t s1_214">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1a_214" class="t s1_214">214</div>
