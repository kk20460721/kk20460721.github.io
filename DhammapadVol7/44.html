<div id="t1_44" class="t s1_44">COMMIT ADULTERY</div>
<div id="t2_44" class="t s1_44">....</div>
<div id="t3_44" class="t s1_44">The meaning -- the ordinary meaning -- of the word 'adultery' </div>
<div id="t4_44" class="t s1_44">is: making love to a woman you are not married to. But the real meaning of adultery is </div>
<div id="t5_44" class="t s1_44">making love while you are not in love. She may be your own wife, but if you are not in </div>
<div id="t6_44" class="t s1_44">love, then making love to her is adultery. </div>
<div id="t7_44" class="t s1_44">And man is a complex phenomenon: today you may be in love with your wife -- yes, </div>
<div id="t8_44" class="t s1_44">even with your wife! I know it is difficult, it is hard, and it is very rare too, but it </div>
<div id="t9_44" class="t s1_44">happens. Today you may be in love with your own wife, and then making love to her is </div>
<div id="ta_44" class="t s1_44">prayer, is worship, it is communion with God. And this communion can happen even </div>
<div id="tb_44" class="t s1_44">with some other woman to whom you are not married. If love is there then it is not </div>
<div id="tc_44" class="t s1_44">adultery, and if love is not there, then even with your wife whatsoever you are doing is </div>
<div id="td_44" class="t s1_44">adultery. </div>
<div id="te_44" class="t s1_44">OR DRINK</div>
<div id="tf_44" class="t s1_44">....</div>
<div id="tg_44" class="t s1_44">Remember, all the buddhas are against any chemical drug that can make </div>
<div id="th_44" class="t s1_44">you unconscious, for the simple reason that you are already so unconscious. </div>
<div id="ti_44" class="t s1_44">Just the other day somebody had asked a question: "Jesus used to drink alcohol. What </div>
<div id="tj_44" class="t s1_44">do you say about it?" </div>
<div id="tk_44" class="t s1_44">I can allow Jesus! He was so conscious that he could afford to drink once in a while. But </div>
<div id="tl_44" class="t s1_44">I cannot allow you. You are already so unconscious, you are already so burdened; now, </div>
<div id="tm_44" class="t s1_44">making you more unconscious will be dragging you towards hell. </div>
<div id="tn_44" class="t s1_44">In the East, particularly in India, there has existed a tremendously beautiful esoteric </div>
<div id="to_44" class="t s1_44">school of tantrikas. One of their very secret methods is that whenever a master thinks </div>
<div id="tp_44" class="t s1_44">that a disciple is ready, he allows him to drink alcohol or take some other drug in small </div>
<div id="tq_44" class="t s1_44">portions, in small quantities, slowly. As his meditation deepens he is allowed to drink </div>
<div id="tr_44" class="t s1_44">bigger amounts. The only condition to be fulfilled is that he should remain conscious. </div>
<div id="ts_44" class="t s1_44">Even under the influence of the drug he should remain conscious -- that is the only </div>
<div id="tt_44" class="t s1_44">condition to be fulfilled. This is a rare experiment! </div>
<div id="tu_44" class="t s1_44">And a moment comes when a real meditator can drink as much... he can drink alcohol </div>
<div id="tv_44" class="t s1_44">just like water and he will remain as centered as ever, as conscious as ever. That is the </div>
<div id="tw_44" class="t s1_44">crucial test. That day the master says, "Now there is no need to drink at all. You passed </div>
<div id="tx_44" class="t s1_44">through the test." </div>
<div id="ty_44" class="t s1_44">Buddha is talking about you. He is not giving these sutras to tantrikas, he is talking to </div>
<div id="tz_44" class="t s1_44">the common man. Hence he says: IF YOU KILL, LIE OR STEAL, COMMIT ADULTERY </div>
<div id="t10_44" class="t s1_44">OR DRINK, YOU DIG UP YOUR OWN ROOTS. He is not telling you to repress. He is </div>
<div id="t11_44" class="t s1_44">simply saying, become more aware. Buddha was never in favor of repression. </div>
<div id="t12_44" class="t s1_44">Repression is an unconscious effort; it never transforms you. It keeps you the same but </div>
<div id="t13_44" class="t s1_44">repressed. </div>
<div id="t14_44" class="t s1_44">"Sinners!" shouted the evangelist, accusingly, at the tent full of true believers. "You are </div>
<div id="t15_44" class="t s1_44">all sinners. Every one of you has something on his conscience, and one sin is just as bad </div>
<div id="t16_44" class="t s1_44">as another. Stealing is as bad as lying. Ain't that so, Brother William?" </div>
<div id="t17_44" class="t s1_44">Brother William nodded his agreement. </div>
<div id="t18_44" class="t s1_44">"And adultery is just as bad as murder. Ain't that right, Sister Rose?" </div>
<div id="t19_44" class="t s1_44">"Can't rightly say, Preacher," replied Sister Rose. "I never killed nobody." </div>
