<div id="t1_121" class="t s1_121">be scientific. The earth is round and not flat. The Bible has no right to say anything </div>
<div id="t2_121" class="t s1_121">about something objective. The Bible is a religious book; it has its own dimension. Don't </div>
<div id="t3_121" class="t s1_121">confuse these dimensions. </div>
<div id="t4_121" class="t s1_121">Because of this confusion there has arisen a great conflict between science and religion. </div>
<div id="t5_121" class="t s1_121">There is no need at all. Science has its own realm, its own territory. First the priests </div>
<div id="t6_121" class="t s1_121">started interfering with science; now, the whole story is again being repeated in the </div>
<div id="t7_121" class="t s1_121">opposite order. Now scientists are trying to interfere in the world of religion. </div>
<div id="t8_121" class="t s1_121">Don't ask a scientist whether God exists or not -- that is none of his business. What does </div>
<div id="t9_121" class="t s1_121">he know about God? That is not his dimension. And whatsoever he says about God is </div>
<div id="ta_121" class="t s1_121">stupid; whatsoever he says is going to be wrong. </div>
<div id="tb_121" class="t s1_121">It is like asking a great doctor about poetry -- he may be a great doctor, a great </div>
<div id="tc_121" class="t s1_121">physician, but asking him about poetry just because he is a great physician is foolish. Or </div>
<div id="td_121" class="t s1_121">asking a great poet about your illness because he is a great poet...you can see the </div>
<div id="te_121" class="t s1_121">stupidity of it. You will not go to a great poet to be diagnosed just because he is a great </div>
<div id="tf_121" class="t s1_121">poet. You will go to a doctor -- he may not be a poet at all. </div>
<div id="tg_121" class="t s1_121">The scientist has no right to say anything about the interiority of humanity -- that is not </div>
<div id="th_121" class="t s1_121">his world. But now he is interfering. He is doing the same wrong that the priests have </div>
<div id="ti_121" class="t s1_121">been doing for centuries. </div>
<div id="tj_121" class="t s1_121">Galileo was called by the pope, forced in his old age to apologize because he had said </div>
<div id="tk_121" class="t s1_121">that it is not the sun that goes round the earth, but the earth that goes round the sun. </div>
<div id="tl_121" class="t s1_121">Now, it is against the Bible. The priests were very much annoyed: "How can you deny </div>
<div id="tm_121" class="t s1_121">the Bible? Who are you?" In his old age -- he was seventy, ill, bed-ridden -- he was </div>
<div id="tn_121" class="t s1_121">forced to go to the court, he was forced to kneel down before the pope, and he was </div>
<div id="to_121" class="t s1_121">asked to apologize. </div>
<div id="tp_121" class="t s1_121">He must have been a man of humor, he must have had a great sense of humor. He said, </div>
<div id="tq_121" class="t s1_121">"Yes, sir, I apologize. I declare that the Bible is right, that the earth does not go round </div>
<div id="tr_121" class="t s1_121">the sun but the sun goes round the earth. Are you satisfied, sir?" </div>
<div id="ts_121" class="t s1_121">And they were all happy. They said, "We are satisfied." </div>
<div id="tt_121" class="t s1_121">And then Galileo laughed. He said, "But whatsoever I say, it makes no difference -- the </div>
<div id="tu_121" class="t s1_121">earth goes round the sun. My statements, what do they mean? What can they do? What </div>
<div id="tv_121" class="t s1_121">can I do? My saying it won't help -- the earth won't listen. But I apologize, I am wrong </div>
<div id="tw_121" class="t s1_121">and the Bible is right. But remember well: the earth goes round the sun -- it has no </div>
<div id="tx_121" class="t s1_121">obligation to fulfill my desire. I would like it to go according to the Bible and according </div>
<div id="ty_121" class="t s1_121">to you, but I am helpless, utterly helpless." </div>
<div id="tz_121" class="t s1_121">The Bible has many unscientific statements, the Vedas have many unscientific </div>
<div id="t10_121" class="t s1_121">statements. All old scriptures have many unscientific statements, for a certain reason: </div>
<div id="t11_121" class="t s1_121">because in those days there was no science as a separate phenomenon. The religious </div>
<div id="t12_121" class="t s1_121">scripture was the only scripture available. So it used to collect everything; whatever </div>
<div id="t13_121" class="t s1_121">knowledge was available was collected in the scripture. It contains art, it contains </div>
<div id="t14_121" class="t s1_121">mathematics, it contains geography, it contains history, it contains science -- it contains </div>
