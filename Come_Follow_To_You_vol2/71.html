<div id="t2_71" class="t s1_71">are? By cutting the attachments you have killed your ego. </div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s1_71">That is the meaning of Jesus. He says: through your attachments, your ego exists </div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s1_71">and gets nourishment. Cut all the attachments and suddenly the ego collapses. It </div>

<div id="t6_71" class="t s1_71">that collapse you are born for the first time. For the first time you are YOU -- not </div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s1_71">somebody's son, not somebody's husband, not somebody's father. For the first </div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s1_71">time you are simply there, in your absolute nakedness, purity, innocence. You </div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s1_71">are undefined, all definitions gone. Suddenly you start throbbing with a new </div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s1_71">heart; you become part of the whole. That small family that was surrounding you </div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s1_71">and creating a boundary is no more there. </div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s1_71">You became small because of the attachment to the family. You become vast once </div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">that attachment is transcended. That's why Jesus uses a very strong word. He </div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">says HATE because less than that won't do. </div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s1_71">Listen: </div>

<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">BRETHREN STOOD WITHOUT, DESIRING TO SPEAK WITH HIM. </div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s1_71">Many more things have to be understood. Jesus knows well that his mother and </div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s1_71">his brothers don't understand him. They think, really, that he has gone a little </div>
<div id="tk_71" class="t s1_71">crazy. Their own brother and he thinks of himself as the son of God! Just think </div>
<div id="tl_71" class="t s1_71">about your brother. If he starts thinking that he is the son of God and always </div>
<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">talks about God who is in heaven, naturally you will think that he has gone out </div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">of his mind. You will seek the help of a psychiatrist; you will give him electric </div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">shocks to bring him back to earth. </div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s1_71">Jesus' relatives thought that he was beside himself; he was a little eccentric, </div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s1_71">crazy, mad. When he went to his village, people would simply laugh, they would </div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">ridicule. At the most they were amused: "Look, this son of the carpenter Joseph -- </div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">and now suddenly he thinks that he is the son of God!" And they know well </div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">whose son he is. Just a few years before, he was working with his father in the </div>
<div id="tu_71" class="t s1_71">workshop: carrying wood from the forest, helping his father. And now suddenly </div>
<div id="tv_71" class="t s1_71">he has gone mad. "Poor Jesus!" </div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s1_71">That was the idea of his family also. They felt pity for him. So when somebody </div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s1_71">said, "Your brothers and your mother are waiting without, desiring to speak with </div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s1_71">you," he knows what they are going to speak to him about. He knows that their </div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s1_71">whole effort is somehow to bring him back home and make him normal. </div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s1_71">This is one of the problems with humanity. People you call normal are not </div>
<div id="t11_71" class="t s1_71">normal at all, but they are in the majority. A Buddha always looks abnormal. A </div>
<div id="t12_71" class="t s1_71">Jesus looks abnormal. In a sense he is, because he doesn't behave like you, he </div>
<div id="t13_71" class="t s1_71">doesn't follow the ordinary rules. He does not fit with the society, he is a misfit. </div>
<div id="t14_71" class="t s1_71">And to allow him, creates a suspicion in your mind: if he is right, then you are </div>
<div id="t15_71" class="t s1_71">wrong. That creates a doubt and a trembling. He must be wrong, he must be </div>
