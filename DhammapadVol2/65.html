<div id="t1_65" class="t s1_65">It is said that Krishna had sixteen thousand wives. I used to think that this was too </div>
<div id="t2_65" class="t s1_65">much, but when I came to know that the nizam of Hyderabad had five hundred wives </div>
<div id="t3_65" class="t s1_65">just forty years ago, then it doesn't seem too much -- only thirty-two times more! It </div>
<div id="t4_65" class="t s1_65">seems humanly possible. If you can manage five hundred, why not sixteen thousand? </div>
<div id="t5_65" class="t s1_65">All the kings of the world were doing that. Women were used like cattle. In the great </div>
<div id="t6_65" class="t s1_65">kings' palaces the women were numbered. It was difficult to remember names, so the </div>
<div id="t7_65" class="t s1_65">king could say to his servants, "Bring number four hundred and one" -- because how to </div>
<div id="t8_65" class="t s1_65">remember five hundred names? Numbers...just as soldiers are numbered; they don't </div>
<div id="t9_65" class="t s1_65">have names but only numbers. And it makes a lot of difference. </div>
<div id="ta_65" class="t s1_65">Numbers are absolutely mathematical. Numbers don't breathe, they don't have any </div>
<div id="tb_65" class="t s1_65">heart. Numbers don't have any soul. When a soldier dies in the war, on the notice board </div>
<div id="tc_65" class="t s1_65">you simply read, "Number 15 died." Now, "Number 15 died" is one thing; if you say </div>
<div id="td_65" class="t s1_65">exactly the name of the person, that is totally different. Then he was a husband and the </div>
<div id="te_65" class="t s1_65">wife will be a widow now; he was a father and the children will be orphans now; he </div>
<div id="tf_65" class="t s1_65">was the only support of his old parents, now there will be no support. A family is </div>
<div id="tg_65" class="t s1_65">deserted, the light of a family has disappeared. But when number fifteen dies, number </div>
<div id="th_65" class="t s1_65">fifteen has no wife, remember; number fifteen doesn't have any children, number fifteen </div>
<div id="ti_65" class="t s1_65">doesn't have any old parents. Number fifteen is just number fifteen! And number fifteen </div>
<div id="tj_65" class="t s1_65">is replaceable -- another person will come and will become number fifteen. But no </div>
<div id="tk_65" class="t s1_65">individual human being is replaceable. It is a trick, a psychological trick, to give </div>
<div id="tl_65" class="t s1_65">numbers to soldiers. It helps...nobody takes any note of numbers disappearing; new </div>
<div id="tm_65" class="t s1_65">numbers go on coming and replacing the old numbers. </div>
<div id="tn_65" class="t s1_65">Wives were numbered, and it depended on how much money you had. In fact, in the </div>
<div id="to_65" class="t s1_65">old days, that was the only way to know how rich a man was; it was a kind of </div>
<div id="tp_65" class="t s1_65">measurement. How many wives has he? </div>
<div id="tq_65" class="t s1_65">Now, Hindus, particularly ARYA SAMAJIS, criticize Hazrat Mohammed very much for </div>
<div id="tr_65" class="t s1_65">having nine wives -- and they don't think of Krishna who had sixteen thousand wives. </div>
<div id="ts_65" class="t s1_65">And he is not an exception, he is the rule. In this country, as in other countries, down </div>
<div id="tt_65" class="t s1_65">the ages, the woman has been exploited -- and the way to exploit is money! The whole </div>
<div id="tu_65" class="t s1_65">world has suffered through prostitution, it degrades human beings. And what is a </div>
<div id="tv_65" class="t s1_65">prostitute? She has been reduced to a mechanism, and you can purchase her with </div>
<div id="tw_65" class="t s1_65">money. </div>
<div id="tx_65" class="t s1_65">But remember perfectly well that your wives are not very different either. A prostitute </div>
<div id="ty_65" class="t s1_65">is like a taxi, and your wife is like your own car, it is a permanent arrangement. Poor </div>
<div id="tz_65" class="t s1_65">people cannot make permanent arrangements, they have to use taxis. Rich people can </div>
<div id="t10_65" class="t s1_65">make permanent arrangements -- they can have their own cars. And the richer they are, </div>
<div id="t11_65" class="t s1_65">the more cars they can have. </div>
<div id="t12_65" class="t s1_65">I know one person who had three hundred and sixty-five cars -- one car for every day. </div>
<div id="t13_65" class="t s1_65">And he had one car made in solid gold</div>
<div id="t14_65" class="t s1_65">....</div>
<div id="t15_65" class="t s1_65">Money is power, and power can purchase anything. So, Nirmal, you are not wrong that </div>
<div id="t16_65" class="t s1_65">there is some connection between sex and money. </div>
<div id="t17_65" class="t s1_65">One thing more has to be understood. The person who represses sex becomes more </div>
<div id="t18_65" class="t s1_65">money-minded, because money becomes a substitute for sex. Money becomes his love. </div>
