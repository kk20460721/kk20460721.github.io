<div id="t1_55" class="t s1_55">The people who are interested in knowledge, or interested in scriptures, or </div>
<div id="t2_55" class="t s1_55">interested in learning from other wise men, are not doing anything to reach to </div>
<div id="t3_55" class="t s1_55">their own light, to the very source of enlightenment. </div>
<div id="t4_55" class="t s1_55">The same happened with Gautam Buddha. His closest disciples were brahmins </div>
<div id="t5_55" class="t s1_55">and hence a great misunderstanding has arisen in their reportings. What they </div>
<div id="t6_55" class="t s1_55">have reported about Gautam Buddha is mixed, polluted, corrupted by their own </div>
<div id="t7_55" class="t s1_55">knowledgeability, by their own learning. Their minds have come in and </div>
<div id="t8_55" class="t s1_55">interfered with the message that was given in silence -- a message that was </div>
<div id="t9_55" class="t s1_55">transmitted heart to heart, being to being, but not from mind to mind. </div>
<div id="ta_55" class="t s1_55">The same unfortunate situation has happened with Bodhidharma -- even on a far </div>
<div id="tb_55" class="t s1_55">greater scale because Bodhidharma was born in India, but he was teaching in </div>
<div id="tc_55" class="t s1_55">China. The people who surrounded him, who became interested in him, were the </div>
<div id="td_55" class="t s1_55">people who were interested in knowledge. And certainly he had the golden key </div>
<div id="te_55" class="t s1_55">that opens all the mysteries of life. His every word comes from an authentic </div>
<div id="tf_55" class="t s1_55">experience. He attracted thousands of monks, but the problem is that those were </div>
<div id="tg_55" class="t s1_55">the people who crammed his words and forgot the phenomenal presence of </div>
<div id="th_55" class="t s1_55">Bodhidharma. And they have written these sutras. Naturally, there are great </div>
<div id="ti_55" class="t s1_55">mistakes but even though there are many stones, there are a few diamonds, and </div>
<div id="tj_55" class="t s1_55">we can find those diamonds. </div>
<div id="tk_55" class="t s1_55">Even though they were not able to experience in the same way as Bodhidharma, </div>
<div id="tl_55" class="t s1_55">they were certainly impressed by his charismatic being. Just like moths come to </div>
<div id="tm_55" class="t s1_55">the flame of a candle, they came from faraway provinces in China, just to sit at </div>
<div id="tn_55" class="t s1_55">his feet. But it is not enough. It is a good beginning, but it is not the end of the </div>
<div id="to_55" class="t s1_55">journey. They could not forget their own minds. Even while listening to him, </div>
<div id="tp_55" class="t s1_55">they were still thinking their own thoughts, they were still comparing whether it </div>
<div id="tq_55" class="t s1_55">fits with their ideology or not. They were interpreting, giving new meanings, </div>
<div id="tr_55" class="t s1_55">new colors to his words. </div>
<div id="ts_55" class="t s1_55">And because Bodhidharma has not written anything </div>
<div id="tt_55" class="t s1_55">....</div>
<div id="tu_55" class="t s1_55">No enlightened being </div>
<div id="tv_55" class="t s1_55">has written anything for the simple reason that the written word is a dead word. </div>
<div id="tw_55" class="t s1_55">A spoken word has the warmth, the splendor, and the presence of the master. </div>
<div id="tx_55" class="t s1_55">The spoken word is a totally different category from the written word. The </div>
<div id="ty_55" class="t s1_55">written word is only a corpse; the spoken word is alive, it is still breathing. It has </div>
<div id="tz_55" class="t s1_55">a heartbeat which the written word cannot have. That's why no enlightened man </div>
<div id="t10_55" class="t s1_55">around the world, in any age, has ever written anything. </div>
<div id="t11_55" class="t s1_55">So you have to be very aware. I will point out where the minds of the disciples </div>
<div id="t12_55" class="t s1_55">who are collecting these sutras have interfered and destroyed something </div>
<div id="t13_55" class="t s1_55">immensely beautiful. But even though they could not report exactly what </div>
<div id="t14_55" class="t s1_55">Bodhidharma was saying, here and there, perhaps by mistake, they have </div>
<div id="t15_55" class="t s1_55">reported the actual words. </div>
<div id="t16_55" class="t s1_55">Even to find a few actual words spoken by Bodhidharma and give them again a </div>
<div id="t17_55" class="t s1_55">heartbeat, is a great joy. My commentary is not just a commentary; it is giving </div>
<div id="t18_55" class="t s1_55">life, a resurrection, to those beautiful words which have fallen in wrong hands. </div>
