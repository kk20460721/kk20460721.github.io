<div id="t2_103" class="t s1_103">have happened anywhere. He had not realized it when he was not a buddha. Then he </div>
<div id="t3_103" class="t s1_103">had to go, leave the palace, the children, the wife, the parents and move to faraway </div>
<div id="t4_103" class="t s1_103">caves in the mountains, into faraway jungles, to live alone with nature, so that the </div>
<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">society and all its conditionings could be left behind. </div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">Yes, when he became a buddha then he knew that it could have happened anywhere. </div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s1_103">But when you have become a buddha, it is a totally different perspective. It is very easy </div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s1_103">to say things like that when you have attained. </div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s1_103">And that is one of the greatest problems: what the buddhas say, they are saying after </div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s1_103">they have attained, to people who have not yet attained. Communion becomes difficult, </div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s1_103">very difficult. The buddhas say, "You are already buddhas"; and when you hear that </div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s1_103">"We are already buddhas," you say, "Then why be worried about it? Then why </div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s1_103">meditate? And why be a sannyasin?" Then you have missed the whole point! And </div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">Buddha is not saying anything wrong -- he is absolutely correct -- and yet before you </div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">can realize the truth of his statement you will have to experience it on your own. </div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">One day you will have become a buddha. Then you will also be able to say that there </div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">was no need to leave anything. Then you will say, "There was no need to be in the </div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s1_103">buddhafield of a master." But right now it is a need, an absolute need. </div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">A buddhafield facilitates many processes which can happen without the buddhafield, </div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s1_103">but it would take long long, arduous effort. It is the same as when the wind is blowing </div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s1_103">and going towards the other shore: you need not row your boat; you can simply leave </div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s1_103">the boat and the winds will take it to the other shore. In a buddhafield the winds are </div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s1_103">blowing towards the other shore; you can simply surrender to the winds and with no </div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s1_103">effort you will reach the other shore. You can reach the other shore alone too, but then </div>
<div id="tp_103" class="t s1_103">you will have to row the boat. Then you will have to take the risk of being alone in the </div>
<div id="tq_103" class="t s1_103">uncharted sea. </div>
<div id="tr_103" class="t s1_103">In a buddhafield you are not alone, there are many who are moving. A few are ahead of </div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s1_103">you, a few are behind you; and you know that people are moving, that people are </div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s1_103">gaining new insights, that people are evolving, that people are reaching closer to the </div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s1_103">other shore. And those who are ahead of you can always assure you, "Don't be worried. </div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">Go on. Come on! The other shore is visible from our state; soon it will be visible to you </div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">too." And you can say many things to those who are behind you. Those are the people </div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">who need great assurance. Moving into the unknown is not an easy process; a </div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">buddhafield becomes a chain. </div>
<div id="tz_103" class="t s1_103">Yes, Surati, fundamentally it is true -- you can be a buddha anywhere -- but being in a </div>
<div id="t10_103" class="t s1_103">buddhafield things will be far easier. Being with a master in deep love and trust things </div>
<div id="t11_103" class="t s1_103">start happening, just as the spring comes and flowers start blossoming. Out of season </div>
<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">you can also manage to bring flowers to the plants, but then it takes great effort, </div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">unnecessary effort. When the spring is there, things happen of their own accord. Once it </div>
<div id="t14_103" class="t s1_103">has happened, then it looks easy for everybody. </div>
<div id="t15_103" class="t s1_103">When Copernicus discovered some laws, people said, "We could have found them; they </div>
<div id="t16_103" class="t s1_103">are so simple." But nobody had found them before him. </div>
