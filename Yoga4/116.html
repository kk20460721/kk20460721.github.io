<div id="t1_116" class="t s1_116">tiger somehow got hold of the young tiger, because it was difficult to catch hold </div>
<div id="t2_116" class="t s1_116">of him. He escaped -- he tried, he cried, he screamed. He was afraid, he was </div>
<div id="t3_116" class="t s1_116">shivering with fear. All the goats escaped and he was also trying to escape with </div>
<div id="t4_116" class="t s1_116">them, but the old tiger got hold of him and pulled him towards the lake. He </div>
<div id="t5_116" class="t s1_116">would not go. He resisted just the way that you are doing with me. He tried his </div>
<div id="t6_116" class="t s1_116">best not to go. He was scared to death, crying and weeping, but the old tiger </div>
<div id="t7_116" class="t s1_116">wouldn't allow him. The old tiger still pulled him and took him to the lake. </div>
<div id="t8_116" class="t s1_116">The lake was silent like a mirror. He forced the young tiger to look into the </div>
<div id="t9_116" class="t s1_116">water. He saw, with tearful eyes -- the vision was not clear but the vision was </div>
<div id="ta_116" class="t s1_116">there -- that he looked just like the old tiger. Tears disappeared and a new sense </div>
<div id="tb_116" class="t s1_116">of being arose; the goat started disappearing from the mind. He was no more a </div>
<div id="tc_116" class="t s1_116">goat, but he could not believe his own enlightenment. Still the body was </div>
<div id="td_116" class="t s1_116">shivering a little, he was afraid. He was thinking, 'Maybe I am imagining. How </div>
<div id="te_116" class="t s1_116">can a goat turn so suddenly into a tiger? It is not possible, it has never happened. </div>
<div id="tf_116" class="t s1_116">It never happens that way.' He couldn't believe his own eyes, but now the first </div>
<div id="tg_116" class="t s1_116">spark, the first ray of light had entered into his being. He was no more the same </div>
<div id="th_116" class="t s1_116">really. He could never be the same again. </div>
<div id="ti_116" class="t s1_116">The old tiger took him to his cave. Now he was not so resistant, not so reluctant, </div>
<div id="tj_116" class="t s1_116">not so afraid. By and by he was getting bold, gathering courage. He started </div>
<div id="tk_116" class="t s1_116">walking like a tiger as he went to the cave. The old tiger gave him some meat to </div>
<div id="tl_116" class="t s1_116">eat. It is difficult for a vegetarian, almost impossible, nauseating, but the old tiger </div>
<div id="tm_116" class="t s1_116">wouldn't listen. He forced him to eat. When the nose of the young tiger came </div>
<div id="tn_116" class="t s1_116">near the meat, something happened: from the smell, something deep in his being </div>
<div id="to_116" class="t s1_116">which had been fast asleep was awakened. He was pulled, attracted towards the </div>
<div id="tp_116" class="t s1_116">meat, and he started eating. Once he tasted the meat, a roar burst through his </div>
<div id="tq_116" class="t s1_116">being. The goat disappeared in that roar, and the tiger was there in his beauty </div>
<div id="tr_116" class="t s1_116">and splendor. </div>
<div id="ts_116" class="t s1_116">This is the whole process, and an old tiger is needed. That is the trouble: the old </div>
<div id="tt_116" class="t s1_116">tiger is here, and howsoever you try to dodge, this way and that, it is not </div>
<div id="tu_116" class="t s1_116">possible. You are reluctant, you are difficult to bring to the lake, but I will bring </div>
<div id="tv_116" class="t s1_116">you. You have been eating grass your whole life. You have completely forgotten </div>
<div id="tw_116" class="t s1_116">the smell of meat, but I will force you to eat it. Once the taste is there, the roar </div>
<div id="tx_116" class="t s1_116">will burst. In that explosion the goat will disappear and a Buddha will be born. </div>
<div id="ty_116" class="t s1_116">So you need not worry about where I am going to get so many Buddhas to study, </div>
<div id="tz_116" class="t s1_116">I will produce them. </div>
