<div id="t3_124" class="t s1_124">Religion died because it became just a borrowed knowledge. Jesus says. "God is," </div>
<div id="t4_124" class="t s1_124">and Christians go on believing. Krishna says, "God is," and Hindus go on </div>
<div id="t5_124" class="t s1_124">believing. And Mohammed says, "God is, and I have encountered him and I have </div>

<div id="ti_124" class="t s1_124">then he said, "Hey, Mac, what is your girl's address?" </div>

<div id="tq_124" class="t s1_124">has happened. </div>
<div id="tr_124" class="t s1_124">Patanjali does not believe in borrowed experience. He does not believe in belief. </div>
<div id="ts_124" class="t s1_124">That's his scientific attitude. He believes in experience, he believes in experiment. </div>
<div id="tt_124" class="t s1_124">Patanjali can be understood by Galileo, by Einstein. Galileo and Einstein can be </div>
