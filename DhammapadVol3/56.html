<div id="t1_56" class="t s1_56">WHY DOES JESUS TELL HIS DISCIPLES: BE AS CUNNING AS THE SERPENTS AND </div>
<div id="t2_56" class="t s1_56">AS INNOCENT AS THE DOVES? </div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s1_56">Anand Jayesh, the serpent is the symbol of wisdom. In all the ancient cultures of the </div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s1_56">world -- Hebrew, Hindu, Chinese -- the serpent is the only symbol which is common. </div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s1_56">By 'cunning' Jesus does not really mean cunning as you understand it. In the ancient </div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s1_56">Aramaic, the language that Jesus spoke, there is only one word for both 'wisdom' and </div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s1_56">'cunning', hence the wrong translation. </div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s1_56">But why have Christians chosen to translate it as 'cunning' and not as 'wisdom'? -- </div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s1_56">because of the biblical story that it is the serpent who seduced, corrupted the mind of </div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s1_56">Eve, persuaded her to go against God's commandment and to eat the fruit of the tree of </div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s1_56">knowledge. Because of this biblical story the serpent has become the original source of </div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s1_56">sin. It is the serpent who persuaded Eve, then Eve persuaded Adam and humanity fell </div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s1_56">from the grace of God. Adam and Eve were turned out of the Garden of Eden; hence the </div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s1_56">serpent became a condemned phenomenon. </div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s1_56">But in reality the parable has a totally different meaning. Christians will not concede to </div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s1_56">that meaning. What meaning do I give to that immensely significant parable? It has </div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s1_56">many meanings. That is the beauty of ancient parables: they have many-dimensional </div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s1_56">richness. They are not one-dimensional, they are multidimensional. They can be </div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s1_56">interpreted in a thousand and one ways; that is their richness. They have many facets; </div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s1_56">they are like a diamond -- and the more facets a diamond has, the more valuable it is. </div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s1_56">When the kohinoor was found for the first time it was a very big stone, the biggest </div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s1_56">diamond the world has ever known. Now it is only one third of its original weight, </div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s1_56">because down the ages the jewelers have been polishing, cutting, and polishing and </div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s1_56">cutting; they have been giving new facets to the diamond. Now it is one third of its </div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s1_56">weight but millions of times more valuable. So are ancient parables: they are kohinoors. </div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s1_56">But the problem with the so-called religions is that they become addicted to one </div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s1_56">meaning. Then they become afraid of other meanings, other possibilities. </div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s1_56">The serpent is not cunning, the serpent is wise in the parable. It is because of his </div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s1_56">wisdom that humanity was born. If there had been no serpent, you would not have </div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s1_56">been here -- not even Jesus would have been, nor Buddha. The world would have </div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s1_56">lacked humanity. It is the serpent and his wisdom that creates this great journey of </div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s1_56">humanity -- and it has been of immense value; otherwise there would have been trees </div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s1_56">and animals and birds, but no Lao Tzu, no Zarathustra, no Krishna, no Buddha, no </div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s1_56">Mohammed, no Christ, no Kabir, no Nanak. Yes, trees would have been there and birds </div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s1_56">and animals, but the existence would have missed something of immense importance; it </div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s1_56">would have missed humanity, it would have missed human consciousness, which is the </div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s1_56">ultimate growth point up to now. It is the serpent and his wisdom! The serpent was far </div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s1_56">more wise than Eve and Adam, because he taught them rebellion. </div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s1_56">Wisdom is always rebellious. In fact, if you ask me, God was giving an opportunity to </div>
<div id="t14_56" class="t s1_56">Adam and Eve to rebel; hence the commandment not to eat from the tree of knowledge. </div>
<div id="t15_56" class="t s1_56">This is a simple psychological fact. The garden was so big that Adam and Eve, left to </div>
