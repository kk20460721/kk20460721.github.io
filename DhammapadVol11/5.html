<div id="t1_5" class="t s1_5">And this is my experience too: howsoever I try I cannot confuse you any more! You </div>
<div id="t2_5" class="t s1_5">have already touched the rock bottom; there is nothing below it, you can't go deeper </div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">than that. You are utterly secure. </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">So the gods said, "You cannot confuse them more. They are so skillful in confusing </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">themselves, they have done it already to the maximum. So about that we don't agree. </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">"And one thing more: there may be one or two people among ten thousand who are just </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">between these two sorts of people -- the one who can understand you and the millions </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">who cannot understand you and are bound to misunderstand you. Between these two </div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">do you think," they said to Buddha, "there is not a possibility of a few people, one or </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">two or three -- yes, they will be very few, they can be counted on the fingers -- who may </div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">be just in the middle, neither so confused that they cannot be helped at all nor so clear </div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">that they can find their path on their own? Speak for them; they will be helped by you." </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">And Buddha had to agree; it was not an argument for argument's sake. People like </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">Buddha don't argue for argument's sake; he saw the truth of it. He said, "I have to agree </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">with you. Yes, there are a few people who are exactly in the middle, on the boundary </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">line. If I don't say anything to them they may be lost in the crowd; if some help is given </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">to them, a little hand, they may be pulled out of their mud. I will speak for them." </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">He was going to be an arhata. Arhata means one who has arrived but is unconcerned </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">about others, almost cold, does not care a bit. He became a bodhisattva; that is the </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">second category. </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">Bodhisattva means one who is not only a mystic but also a master, who has not only </div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">known himself, but tries to make it known to others. Of course, the work of the </div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">bodhisattva is far more difficult; the arhata is in a better position. The bodhisattva has to </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">struggle with all kinds of insanities -- insane people, split people, schizophrenic people, </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">neurotics, psychotics. Humanity is full of these people. The bodhisattva has to go into </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">the crowd, into the mud where you are, because that is the only way to help you out. </div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">Unless he comes amongst you, unless he lives with you, unless he relates with you, </div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">communicates with you, in a thousand and one ways seduces you, creates the longing </div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">for truth in you, he cannot help you. And these are not easy things. </div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">People are not concerned about truth at all. They are concerned about money, they are </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">concerned about power, about prestige. They are not interested in being liberated, they </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">don't want to be sane. They protect their insanity in every possible way because they </div>

<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">insanities. These divisions have been destructive. These divisions have proved curses to </div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">humanity. They have been calamities, but you are very proud. Everybody seems to be </div>
