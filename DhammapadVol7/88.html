<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">You have not looked at the poor woman for years, for the simple reason that marriage </div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">makes things so certain. Marriage makes things so dead and dull. Marriage takes all </div>

<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">Buddha said, "I know it does not look right, but this much I owe to her. I have to </div>
