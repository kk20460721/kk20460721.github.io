<div id="t1_163" class="t s1_163">I have heard a story about Joseph Stalin: </div>
<div id="t2_163" class="t s1_163">Molotov, his foreign minister, phoned him from the UNO. His wife was sitting by his </div>
<div id="t3_163" class="t s1_163">side while he took the phone call. Joseph Stalin said, "No, no, no, yes, no!" </div>
<div id="t4_163" class="t s1_163">The wife was surprised. Not by the no's, so many no's -- she knew her husband </div>
<div id="t5_163" class="t s1_163">perfectly well, he was a man of no. He was one of the most egoistic men possible. His </div>
<div id="t6_163" class="t s1_163">name is significant: 'stalin' means a man of steel. He was not really a man but a steel </div>
<div id="t7_163" class="t s1_163">man, a machine, a robot. No was just natural to him. </div>
<div id="t8_163" class="t s1_163">The wife was puzzled that between those four no's there was one yes. She asked him, </div>
<div id="t9_163" class="t s1_163">"Can I ask you one question? I don't want to interfere in your politics and what is going </div>
<div id="ta_163" class="t s1_163">on between you and Molotov and what you are saying. Just one thing... and I have </div>
<div id="tb_163" class="t s1_163">become very curious: did you really say one yes amongst all those four no's, or did I </div>
<div id="tc_163" class="t s1_163">mishear you? Did you really say yes?" </div>
<div id="td_163" class="t s1_163">Stalin said, "Yes, I said yes." </div>
<div id="te_163" class="t s1_163">The wife asked, "Then one question more: Why did you say yes?" </div>
<div id="tf_163" class="t s1_163">He said, "When I said three no's, Molotov asked, 'Did you say no?' I said, 'Yes.'" </div>
<div id="tg_163" class="t s1_163">There are people who can say yes only when it is nothing but a camouflaged no. And </div>
<div id="th_163" class="t s1_163">there are also people, very rare, who can say no only as a camouflaged yes. These are </div>
<div id="ti_163" class="t s1_163">the buddhas. Yes, sometimes they also say no, but their no is not a negative no; the </div>
<div id="tj_163" class="t s1_163">heart of their no is yes. They are incapable of saying no. If they have to use the word </div>
<div id="tk_163" class="t s1_163">sometimes, in certain circumstances, it really means yes. </div>
<div id="tl_163" class="t s1_163">A man like Buddha can sometimes be very hard, but he is hard because of his </div>
<div id="tm_163" class="t s1_163">compassion and love. George Gurdjieff was very hard on his disciples just because of </div>
<div id="tn_163" class="t s1_163">his infinite compassion, his total love. </div>
<div id="to_163" class="t s1_163">Yes is the very essence of religion, no the very foundation of irreligion. The atheist is not </div>
<div id="tp_163" class="t s1_163">one who does not believe in God; the atheist is one who believes in no. And the theist is </div>
<div id="tq_163" class="t s1_163">not one who believes in God; the theist is one who believes in yes -- because there have </div>
<div id="tr_163" class="t s1_163">been theists like Buddha and Mahavira who do not believe in God, yet where else can </div>
<div id="ts_163" class="t s1_163">you find more religious people? And there are millions of people who believe in God, </div>
<div id="tt_163" class="t s1_163">and their life gives no indication of any religion -- no fragrance. They stink of irreligion, </div>
<div id="tu_163" class="t s1_163">of violence, of hatred, of jealousy, of possessiveness. Flowers of love don't bloom in </div>
<div id="tv_163" class="t s1_163">their life. </div>
<div id="tw_163" class="t s1_163">Yes is the foundation of a true religious life. </div>
<div id="tx_163" class="t s1_163">You ask me, "What is yes?" </div>
<div id="ty_163" class="t s1_163">Yes is dropping of the ego. </div>
<div id="tz_163" class="t s1_163">Yes is coming out of the mind. Yes is trust. </div>
<div id="t10_163" class="t s1_163">Just the other day Buddha was talking about trust: Trust, meditate, and see. Yes means </div>
<div id="t11_163" class="t s1_163">trust, and trust is the beginning of meditation. Meditation means relaxing with </div>
<div id="t12_163" class="t s1_163">existence. Unless you trust, unless you can say yes to existence, how can you relax? </div>
<div id="t13_163" class="t s1_163">People cannot relax because they are afraid. People cannot relax because they fear that if </div>
<div id="t14_163" class="t s1_163">they relax they may be cheated. People can relax only with others whom they trust. </div>
<div id="t15_163" class="t s1_163">With a stranger in your room you may not be able to sleep in the night. Who knows, he </div>
<div id="t16_163" class="t s1_163">may cut your throat. Who knows, he may steal your money and escape. But with your </div>
