<div id="t1_81" class="t s1_81">Queen of Rumania, herself has come. He thought, "Must be some other woman gone </div>
<div id="t2_81" class="t s1_81">crazy. How long does she think she has been a queen?" </div>
<div id="t3_81" class="t s1_81">Another story I have heard: </div>
<div id="t4_81" class="t s1_81">A patient was brought to a psychiatrist by friends, who told the doctor that the man was </div>
<div id="t5_81" class="t s1_81">suffering from delusions that an enormous fortune was awaiting him. He was expecting </div>
<div id="t6_81" class="t s1_81">two letters which would give him full details involving a rubber plantation in Sumatra </div>
<div id="t7_81" class="t s1_81">and titles to some mines in South Africa. </div>
<div id="t8_81" class="t s1_81">"It was a difficult case and I worked hard on it," the psychiatrist told some of his </div>
<div id="t9_81" class="t s1_81">colleagues, "and just when I had the man cured, the two letters arrived." </div>
<div id="ta_81" class="t s1_81">Be alert. Those two letters may be really coming. </div>
<div id="tb_81" class="t s1_81">And don't be afraid. The fear arises because whenever you start walking alone the fear </div>
<div id="tc_81" class="t s1_81">arises. One feels insecure. The doubt arises, "Am I right?" because the whole crowd is </div>
<div id="td_81" class="t s1_81">going in one direction; you start walking alone. With the crowd the doubt never arises </div>
<div id="te_81" class="t s1_81">because you think, "Millions of people are going in this direction; there must be </div>
<div id="tf_81" class="t s1_81">something in it, has to be." The crowd mind prevails over you, the collective mind </div>
<div id="tg_81" class="t s1_81">prevails over you. So many people cannot be wrong, must be right. </div>
<div id="th_81" class="t s1_81">I have heard about one psychoanalyst who went on a picnic They were trying to find a </div>
<div id="ti_81" class="t s1_81">right spot; then one member of the group told them to come. "This is a beautiful place," </div>
<div id="tj_81" class="t s1_81">he said, "the right spot. Big trees, shade, the river flowing by, and absolutely silent." </div>
<div id="tk_81" class="t s1_81">The psychiatrist said, "Yes, ten million ants can't be wrong." </div>
<div id="tl_81" class="t s1_81">Ten million ants can't be wrong. Ants gather together wherever there is a picnic spot -- </div>
<div id="tm_81" class="t s1_81">flies and ants. That is our inner mathematics, that so many people, then they cannot be </div>
<div id="tn_81" class="t s1_81">wrong. Alone-one feels dizzy. With the crowd, people all around -- this side, that side, in </div>
<div id="to_81" class="t s1_81">front, in back -- a whole ocean of people, one feels perfectly right. So many people are </div>
<div id="tp_81" class="t s1_81">going: they must be going in the right direction. And everybody is thinking the same. </div>
<div id="tq_81" class="t s1_81">Nobody knows where they are going. They are just going because the whole crowd is </div>
<div id="tr_81" class="t s1_81">going. And if you ask everybody individually, "Are you going in the right direction?" he </div>
<div id="ts_81" class="t s1_81">will say, "I don't know. Because the whole world is going, so I am going. </div>
<div id="tt_81" class="t s1_81">My whole effort here is to bring you out of the collective mind, to help make you an </div>
<div id="tu_81" class="t s1_81">individual. In the beginning you will have to face chaos. And great trust will be needed, </div>
<div id="tv_81" class="t s1_81">tremendous trust will be needed. Otherwise you can get out of the collective mind and </div>
<div id="tw_81" class="t s1_81">you may not get into the individual mind; then you will be mad. That's the risk. Without </div>
<div id="tx_81" class="t s1_81">trust, moving into meditation is risky. I will not tell you to move into it; I will tell you it </div>
<div id="ty_81" class="t s1_81">is better to remain normal, whatsoever normality means. Remain adjusted with the </div>
<div id="tz_81" class="t s1_81">society. But if you are really ready to go on a great adventure, the greatest, then trust. </div>
<div id="t10_81" class="t s1_81">And then wait for chaos. </div>
<div id="t11_81" class="t s1_81">The more aware you become, the less, of course, you are conscious of it. Because there is </div>
<div id="t12_81" class="t s1_81">no need. Awareness is enough. Consciousness of awareness will be a strain. In the </div>
<div id="t13_81" class="t s1_81">beginning it is so. You start learning to drive a car. Of course you are much troubled; you </div>
<div id="t14_81" class="t s1_81">have to manage so many things -- the wheel, the gear, the clutch, the accelerator, the </div>
<div id="t15_81" class="t s1_81">brake, the road, and if you have a wife sitting at the back</div>
<div id="t16_81" class="t s1_81">....</div>
<div id="t17_81" class="t s1_81">One has to be very, very </div>
<div id="t18_81" class="t s1_81">conscious because so many things have to be managed together. It seems almost </div>
<div id="t19_81" class="t s1_81">impossible in the beginning. By and by everything drops; you simply go on driving. You </div>
<div id="t1a_81" class="t s1_81">can talk to a friend, you can listen to the radio, you can sing a song, or you can meditate, </div>
