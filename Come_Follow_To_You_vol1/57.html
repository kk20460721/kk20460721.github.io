<div id="t1_57" class="t s1_57">an old man, uneducated but wise through experience. They told him their </div>
<div id="t2_57" class="t s1_57">problem. </div>
<div id="t3_57" class="t s1_57">The old man laughed. He said, "Don't be worried. It is simple." He loaned one of </div>
<div id="t4_57" class="t s1_57">his own camels to them -- now there were eighteen camels -- and then he </div>
<div id="t5_57" class="t s1_57">divided. Nine camels were given to the first and he was satisfied, perfectly </div>
<div id="t6_57" class="t s1_57">satisfied. Six camels were given to the second, one third; he was also perfectly </div>
<div id="t7_57" class="t s1_57">satisfied. And two camels were given to the third, one ninth; he was also </div>
<div id="t8_57" class="t s1_57">satisfied. One camel was left. That was loaned. He took his camel back and said, </div>
<div id="t9_57" class="t s1_57">"You can go." </div>
<div id="ta_57" class="t s1_57">Wisdom is practical, knowledge impractical. Knowledge is abstract, wisdom is </div>
<div id="tb_57" class="t s1_57">earthly; knowledge is just words, wisdom is experience. </div>
<div id="tc_57" class="t s1_57">The Bible is very simple. Don't be deceived by its simplicity. In its simplicity it </div>
<div id="td_57" class="t s1_57">has the wisdom of the ages. It is very poetic; I have never come across anything </div>
<div id="te_57" class="t s1_57">more poetic than the Bible. One can simply go on relishing it, one can go on </div>
<div id="tf_57" class="t s1_57">repeating the words of Jesus. They come from the heart and they go to the heart. </div>
<div id="tg_57" class="t s1_57">But don't go through a mediator. Those mediators are mediocres, they destroy </div>
<div id="th_57" class="t s1_57">the whole thing. I have looked through many commentaries on the Bible, but I </div>
<div id="ti_57" class="t s1_57">have never come across a single intelligent commentary. They all destroy. I have </div>
<div id="tj_57" class="t s1_57">never seen any single commentary from any theologian who has added anything </div>
<div id="tk_57" class="t s1_57">to the Bible, who has in any way made its glory more manifest. They DIM it. </div>
<div id="tl_57" class="t s1_57">And that is bound to be so. Only a man of the quality of Jesus can reveal the </div>
<div id="tm_57" class="t s1_57">truth of it, only a man of the quality of Jesus can enhance its beauty. People who </div>
<div id="tn_57" class="t s1_57">live in the dark valleys and people who live on the sunny peaks of the Himalayas </div>
<div id="to_57" class="t s1_57">don't understand each other's language. When the man from the peak speaks </div>
<div id="tp_57" class="t s1_57">and the man from the valley interprets, everything goes wrong. </div>
<div id="tq_57" class="t s1_57">Yes, you are right -- your twenty years may have been wasted. But it will be a </div>
<div id="tr_57" class="t s1_57">total misunderstanding if you think that Jesus is not for you. Jesus is for all, that </div>
<div id="ts_57" class="t s1_57">is not the question. But go direct: become more meditative, become more </div>
<div id="tt_57" class="t s1_57">prayerful, and go direct. And forget all that has been told to you about the Bible; </div>
<div id="tu_57" class="t s1_57">the Bible is enough. </div>
<div id="tv_57" class="t s1_57">If you want to understand the Upanishads, it may be difficult to understand </div>
<div id="tw_57" class="t s1_57">them directly because they are very refined. The people who have been talking in </div>
<div id="tx_57" class="t s1_57">the Upanishads were great philosophers; they need commentaries. But Jesus is I </div>
<div id="ty_57" class="t s1_57">plain, his truth is plain. He is a very ordinary villager; no commentary is needed. </div>
<div id="tz_57" class="t s1_57">He is his own light. And if you cannot understand Jesus, then who will you be </div>
<div id="t10_57" class="t s1_57">able to understand? Throw all the foolish commentaries away. Go direct. Jesus is </div>
<div id="t11_57" class="t s1_57">so simple, you can have a direct contact, </div>
<div id="t12_57" class="t s1_57">I am not commenting on Jesus, I am simply responding. I am not a commentator. </div>
<div id="t13_57" class="t s1_57">To be a commentator is to do a very ugly job. Why should I comment on Jesus? </div>
<div id="t14_57" class="t s1_57">He is plain, he is absolutely simple. Just like two plus two make four -- he is that </div>
<div id="t15_57" class="t s1_57">simple. Just like in the morning the sun rises and everybody knows it is morning. </div>
<div id="t16_57" class="t s1_57">He is so simple. </div>
