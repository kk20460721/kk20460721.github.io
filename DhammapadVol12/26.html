<div id="t1_26" class="t s1_26">Prem Prageeta, the German females are precisely that -- females -- neither ladies nor </div>
<div id="t2_26" class="t s1_26">women. 'Female' is more scientific and more German, more scholarly, neutral; it has no </div>
<div id="t3_26" class="t s1_26">evaluation in it. </div>
<div id="t4_26" class="t s1_26">And God, in fact, is neither he nor she. </div>
<div id="t5_26" class="t s1_26">So if you say he is a he I will say he is a she; if you say he is a she I will say he is a he -- </div>
<div id="t6_26" class="t s1_26">simply to unhinge you from your convictions. </div>
<div id="t7_26" class="t s1_26">Once it happened: </div>
<div id="t8_26" class="t s1_26">Buddha entered a village. A man asked him as he was entering the village, "Does God </div>
<div id="t9_26" class="t s1_26">exist?" </div>
<div id="ta_26" class="t s1_26">He said, "No, absolutely no." </div>
<div id="tb_26" class="t s1_26">In the afternoon another man came and he asked, "Does God exist?" </div>
<div id="tc_26" class="t s1_26">And he said, "Yes, absolutely yes." </div>
<div id="td_26" class="t s1_26">In the evening a third man came and he asked, "Does God exist?" </div>
<div id="te_26" class="t s1_26">Buddha closed his eyes and remained utterly silent. The man also closed his eyes. </div>
<div id="tf_26" class="t s1_26">Something transpired in that silence. After a few minutes the man touched Buddha's </div>
<div id="tg_26" class="t s1_26">feet, bowed down, paid his respects and said, "You are the first man who has answered </div>
<div id="th_26" class="t s1_26">my question." </div>
<div id="ti_26" class="t s1_26">Now, Buddha's attendant, Ananda, was very much puzzled: "In the morning he said </div>
<div id="tj_26" class="t s1_26">no, in the afternoon he said yes, in the evening he did not answer at all. What is the </div>
<div id="tk_26" class="t s1_26">matter? What is really the truth?" </div>
<div id="tl_26" class="t s1_26">So when Buddha was going to sleep, Ananda said, "First you answer me; otherwise I </div>
<div id="tm_26" class="t s1_26">will not be able to sleep. You have to be a little more compassionate towards me too. I </div>
<div id="tn_26" class="t s1_26">have been with you the whole day. Those three people don't know about the other </div>
<div id="to_26" class="t s1_26">answers, but I have heard all the three answers. What about me? I am troubled." </div>
<div id="tp_26" class="t s1_26">Buddha said, "I was not talking to you at all! You had not asked, I had not answered </div>
<div id="tq_26" class="t s1_26">YOU. The first man who came was a theist, the second man who came was an atheist, </div>
<div id="tr_26" class="t s1_26">the third man who came was an agnostic. My answer had nothing to do with God, my </div>
<div id="ts_26" class="t s1_26">answer had something to do with the questioner. I was answering the questioner; it was </div>
<div id="tt_26" class="t s1_26">absolutely unconcerned with God. </div>
<div id="tu_26" class="t s1_26">"The person who believes in God, I will say no to him because I want him to drop his </div>
<div id="tv_26" class="t s1_26">idea of God, I want him to be free of his idea of God -- which is borrowed. He has not </div>
<div id="tw_26" class="t s1_26">experienced. If he had experienced he would not have asked me; there would have been </div>
<div id="tx_26" class="t s1_26">no need. </div>
<div id="ty_26" class="t s1_26">"The person who believed in God, he was trying to find confirmation for his belief from </div>
<div id="tz_26" class="t s1_26">me. I was not going to say yes to him -- I am not going to confirm anybody's belief. I </div>
<div id="t10_26" class="t s1_26">had to say no, I had to deny, just to destroy his belief, because all beliefs are barriers to </div>
<div id="t11_26" class="t s1_26">knowing the truth. Theist or atheist, all beliefs, Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan, all </div>
<div id="t12_26" class="t s1_26">beliefs are barriers. </div>
<div id="t13_26" class="t s1_26">"And the person with whom I remained silent was the right inquirer. He had no belief, </div>
<div id="t14_26" class="t s1_26">hence there was no question of destroying anything. I kept silent. That was my message </div>
<div id="t15_26" class="t s1_26">to him: Be silent and know. Don't ask, there is no need to ask. It is not a question which </div>
<div id="t16_26" class="t s1_26">can be answered. It is not an inquiry but a quest, a thirst. Be silent and know. I had </div>
