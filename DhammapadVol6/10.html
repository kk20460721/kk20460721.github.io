<div id="t1_10" class="t s1_10">One man suffered from great anger, so much so that he killed his wife and threw his </div>
<div id="t2_10" class="t s1_10">child into a well. Once he became so angry that he burned his whole house. That was </div>
<div id="t3_10" class="t s1_10">too much! And later on he repented very much. </div>
<div id="t4_10" class="t s1_10">Accidentally a Jaina monk had come to the place. He went to the Jaina monk and he </div>
<div id="t5_10" class="t s1_10">said, "Initiate me, because I don't think that I will ever get rid of my anger if I don't </div>
<div id="t6_10" class="t s1_10">change my life drastically." </div>
<div id="t7_10" class="t s1_10">Now, that "drastically" changing your life is again an expression of anger. A drastic </div>
<div id="t8_10" class="t s1_10">change is an angry change. But the Jaina monk was as asleep as this person -- he was </div>
<div id="t9_10" class="t s1_10">very happy, he was getting one disciple! He immediately initiated him. </div>
<div id="ta_10" class="t s1_10">Jaina monks live naked. He immediately threw off all his clothes. The teacher was very </div>
<div id="tb_10" class="t s1_10">impressed. He said, "It took me five years, slowly slowly to drop my clothes. You are a </div>
<div id="tc_10" class="t s1_10">rare man -- within a moment you have thrown off all your clothes!" </div>
<div id="td_10" class="t s1_10">There is a procedure in the Jaina system that first you reduce your clothes to three, then </div>
<div id="te_10" class="t s1_10">to two, then to one, and then finally you drop that one too. Go slowly, practice, so that </div>
<div id="tf_10" class="t s1_10">you don't feel ashamed of being naked. But a practiced thing is not a real thing; all that </div>
<div id="tg_10" class="t s1_10">is cultivated is false. </div>
<div id="th_10" class="t s1_10">The teacher was very much impressed -- but in fact it was also part of the anger of this </div>
<div id="ti_10" class="t s1_10">man... who could burn his house, who could kill his wife, who could throw his innocent </div>
<div id="tj_10" class="t s1_10">child into a well and kill him. This man was capable of doing anything! He could throw </div>
<div id="tk_10" class="t s1_10">off his clothes and be naked. It looks like great renunciation -- it is nothing. If you look </div>
<div id="tl_10" class="t s1_10">deep down, it is anger standing on its head; it is anger against anger. </div>
<div id="tm_10" class="t s1_10">Soon the man became very famous. Such people can become very famous, because </div>
<div id="tn_10" class="t s1_10">whatsoever they do, they do with passion, with a certain intensity, with fire. He fasted </div>
<div id="to_10" class="t s1_10">long</div>
<div id="tp_10" class="t s1_10">....</div>
<div id="tq_10" class="t s1_10">The teacher gave him the name Shantinath -- SHANTINATH means "lord of peace" -- </div>
<div id="tr_10" class="t s1_10">just to remind him that he had renounced anger, now peace had to be his style of life. </div>
<div id="ts_10" class="t s1_10">And for ten years he was not angry -- not even for a single moment. In fact there was no </div>
<div id="tt_10" class="t s1_10">need, no opportunity arose. Anger does not come from out of the blue; it needs a certain </div>
<div id="tu_10" class="t s1_10">context. His wife was not there, his child was not there, the house, the family, the </div>
<div id="tv_10" class="t s1_10">business, the people, nobody was there. And he was so highly respected; the whole </div>
<div id="tw_10" class="t s1_10">country came to know about this great man, this mahatma. </div>
<div id="tx_10" class="t s1_10">He was in New Delhi. One of his old friends came to the capital, for some business </div>
<div id="ty_10" class="t s1_10">purpose, but when he came to know that his friend was staying in Delhi and he had </div>
<div id="tz_10" class="t s1_10">become a well-known personality -- the whole land worshipped him -- naturally he </div>
<div id="t10_10" class="t s1_10">went to see him and pay his homage. But deep down he was a little suspicious, because </div>
<div id="t11_10" class="t s1_10">he had known this man from his very childhood; he could not believe that he had really </div>
<div id="t12_10" class="t s1_10">become "lord of peace." He was a devil incarnate! Was it possible -- such a change and </div>
<div id="t13_10" class="t s1_10">so suddenly? He was suspicious, but changes happen in the world. He went. </div>
<div id="t14_10" class="t s1_10">He had hoped that the great man would at least recognize him; they were old </div>
<div id="t15_10" class="t s1_10">childhood friends -- for forty years they had known each other. But the great man had </div>
<div id="t16_10" class="t s1_10">become so great now, how could he recognize his friend? He recognized -- the friend </div>
<div id="t17_10" class="t s1_10">immediately knew that he had recognized him -- but he wouldn't look at him. In fact, he </div>
<div id="t18_10" class="t s1_10">avoided him; that very avoiding was an indication that he had recognized him. </div>
