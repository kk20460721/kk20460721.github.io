<div id="t1_94" class="t s1_94">throw away all this nonsense that you call wisdom. Wisdom cannot be </div>
<div id="t2_94" class="t s1_94">purchased; one has to grow into it." And he said one very profound thing: he </div>
<div id="t3_94" class="t s1_94">said, "If you purchase wisdom, if you learn from somebody else, if you borrow it, </div>
<div id="t4_94" class="t s1_94">if it is not your own, then you will always be in trouble; because everything that </div>
<div id="t5_94" class="t s1_94">you can borrow has its opposite. But if you grow in it, then it has no opposite to </div>
<div id="t6_94" class="t s1_94">it." </div>
<div id="t7_94" class="t s1_94">Let me explain it to you. Every law has its opposite, because law is borrowed </div>
<div id="t8_94" class="t s1_94">wisdom. Love has not its opposite -- if it has, then it is not love at all. Every law </div>
<div id="t9_94" class="t s1_94">has its opposite; every law can be argued against, every proof can be disproved, </div>
<div id="ta_94" class="t s1_94">and there is no argument which is absolute or final. </div>
<div id="tb_94" class="t s1_94">I used to know a very great lawyer. He founded a university in India -- he was </div>
<div id="tc_94" class="t s1_94">one of the topmost men in his profession. Once it happened: he was a little </div>
<div id="td_94" class="t s1_94">absent-minded, and he was fighting a case in the Privy Council. Two Indian </div>
<div id="te_94" class="t s1_94">States were fighting. He forgot -- he had drunk too much the night before and he </div>
<div id="tf_94" class="t s1_94">had a hangover. And when he went to the Privy Council, he forgot for whom he </div>
<div id="tg_94" class="t s1_94">was fighting. So he started arguing for the opposite party; and he was a great </div>
<div id="th_94" class="t s1_94">lawyer, so he argued well. His assistant became very much worried -- what </div>
<div id="ti_94" class="t s1_94">should he do? He pulled his coat many times, but he wouldn't listen; he was so </div>
<div id="tj_94" class="t s1_94">much in the debate. When there was a break for tea, the assistant said, "You have </div>
<div id="tk_94" class="t s1_94">destroyed the whole thing. You are arguing against yourself" But the lawyer </div>
<div id="tl_94" class="t s1_94">didn't say anything. When the court started again, he said, "Up to now, I was </div>
<div id="tm_94" class="t s1_94">giving you the arguments for the opposite party. Now I will give the arguments </div>
<div id="tn_94" class="t s1_94">for my party." And he won the case. </div>
<div id="to_94" class="t s1_94">Every law has its opposite; every argument has its opposite. Every proof, if it is </div>
<div id="tp_94" class="t s1_94">only logical, has its opposite. Only love has no opposite to it. The lawyer asked </div>
<div id="tq_94" class="t s1_94">Jesus something; Jesus answered something else. As if the lawyer was only </div>
<div id="tr_94" class="t s1_94">asking for stones, and Jesus gave him diamonds. In a way, it is irrelevant. In </div>
<div id="ts_94" class="t s1_94">another way, in a deeper way, this is the only way it should be. Diamonds were </div>
<div id="tt_94" class="t s1_94">not asked for -- the lawyer had no idea about those diamonds; he was only </div>
<div id="tu_94" class="t s1_94">asking about some coloured stones, at the most, semi-precious. Jesus gave him </div>
<div id="tv_94" class="t s1_94">diamonds -- tremendously valuable; he was asking about law, and Jesus talked </div>
<div id="tw_94" class="t s1_94">about love. </div>
<div id="tx_94" class="t s1_94">Always remember it: whenever you come to an enlightened man, whatsoever </div>
<div id="ty_94" class="t s1_94">you say is not the point. He talks out of his heart. In fact, he does not answer </div>
<div id="tz_94" class="t s1_94">your questions; he answers you, your deepest need, about which you yourself </div>
<div id="t10_94" class="t s1_94">are not aware. </div>
<div id="t11_94" class="t s1_94">It happens so many times when I am answering your questions. Many times you </div>
<div id="t12_94" class="t s1_94">feel as if your question has not been answered. I know it; I am aware of it. It need </div>
<div id="t13_94" class="t s1_94">not be answered. But through your question I can feel a deep urge, a deep </div>
<div id="t14_94" class="t s1_94">enquiry, about which you yourself are not aware. You cannot be aware in the </div>
<div id="t15_94" class="t s1_94">state you are in -- in your unconsciousness you can ask only wrong questions. In </div>
<div id="t16_94" class="t s1_94">my awareness I can answer only right answers. I will repeat: in your sleep you </div>
