<div id="t3_154" class="t s1_154">on him, because he had many servants, guards who were very much taller than himself. </div>
<div id="t4_154" class="t s1_154">And whenever he would see a tall person he would become angry. He would not be </div>
<div id="t5_154" class="t s1_154">able to control himself. </div>
<div id="t6_154" class="t s1_154">The great Russian leader, Lenin, had very small legs. His torso was bigger, his upper </div>

<div id="t9_154" class="t s1_154">were so disproportionate that anybody looking would notice -- he would become angry </div>
<div id="ta_154" class="t s1_154">immediately. Anybody looking at his feet would create anger. </div>

<div id="tc_154" class="t s1_154">nobody would think that he had small feet. But people had become aware of his big </div>

<div id="tj_154" class="t s1_154">enough to hurt the ego. You may be very tall and very handsome, but unintelligent -- </div>
