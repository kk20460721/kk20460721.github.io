<div id="t2_56" class="t s1_56">PROBLEMS. </div>
<div id="t3_56" class="t s1_56">I REMAIN COVERED IN THE CLOUDS OF THESE PROBLEMS SO THAT I </div>
<div id="t4_56" class="t s1_56">CANNOT LISTEN TO YOU AS I SHOULD. </div>
<div id="t5_56" class="t s1_56">PLEASE GUIDE ME. </div>
<div id="t6_56" class="t s1_56">These are not problems. You have made them problems. And once you look at a simple </div>
<div id="t7_56" class="t s1_56">thing as a problem, it becomes a problem -- not that it is. It is your look, your attitude. </div>
<div id="t8_56" class="t s1_56">"Most of the time I feel sexual and my eyes remain seeking the other." So what is the </div>
<div id="t9_56" class="t s1_56">problem in it? Where is the problem? It is as if a hungry man thinks of food and goes on </div>
<div id="ta_56" class="t s1_56">looking for restaurants. What is wrong in it? Will you say that he is in a problem and he </div>
<div id="tb_56" class="t s1_56">has to get out of it? He will die if he get out of his problem; he has to find food. Love is </div>
<div id="tc_56" class="t s1_56">food, a very subtle food. </div>
<div id="td_56" class="t s1_56">"Most of the time I feel sexual and my eyes remain seeking the other." Natural. You are </div>
<div id="te_56" class="t s1_56">searching for food, and you are hungry. But people have taught you that sex is a problem. </div>
<div id="tf_56" class="t s1_56">It is not. It is pure energy. It is divine. It has nothing like a problem in it. You can create a </div>
<div id="tg_56" class="t s1_56">problem if you don't accept the energy, if you don't flow with it. And I know if you flow </div>
<div id="th_56" class="t s1_56">with it, one day you will transcend. You will go higher, you will ride on it and you will </div>
<div id="ti_56" class="t s1_56">reach higher and higher. It is a beautiful energy, which can take you to the very ultimate, </div>
<div id="tj_56" class="t s1_56">but if you make a problem of it, you will remain obsessed with it forever and forever. </div>
<div id="tk_56" class="t s1_56">And the more you fight with it, the more sex and the sexual energy will fight back. It has </div>
<div id="tl_56" class="t s1_56">to fight back, because it is survival energy. </div>
<div id="tm_56" class="t s1_56">You are made of sexual energy. If your father and mother had thought that it was a </div>
<div id="tn_56" class="t s1_56">problem, you would not have been here. You are out of a problem; you exist because of a </div>
<div id="to_56" class="t s1_56">problem. Because your father and mother could not solve the problem, that's why you are </div>
<div id="tp_56" class="t s1_56">here. </div>
<div id="tq_56" class="t s1_56">This is my observation, that a person who thinks of sex as a problem can never be </div>
<div id="tr_56" class="t s1_56">respectful to his parents. How can he be?Just look. It is simple arithmetic. How can you </div>
<div id="ts_56" class="t s1_56">be respectful to your father? He was doing something nasty to your mother! In fact you </div>
<div id="tt_56" class="t s1_56">would like to kill the guy immediately. And how can you respect your mother? She is </div>
<div id="tu_56" class="t s1_56">also a sexual being, as any ordinary woman, just animalistic. How can you touch the feet </div>
<div id="tv_56" class="t s1_56">of your mother? Impossible. Unless you accept your sex as a gift, a divine gift, you </div>
<div id="tw_56" class="t s1_56">cannot respect your father and mother. </div>
<div id="tx_56" class="t s1_56">Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples -- he had written it on his house -- that unless you </div>
<div id="ty_56" class="t s1_56">respect your father and mother, don't enter here. Looks very ordinary. And a man like </div>
<div id="tz_56" class="t s1_56">Gurdjieff could not find a better thing to write? "If you don't respect your father and </div>
<div id="t10_56" class="t s1_56">mother, don't enter here" -- but he has said many things in a simple way. Only a person </div>
<div id="t11_56" class="t s1_56">who accepts sex energy totally can respect his father and mother. Otherwise you can </div>
<div id="t12_56" class="t s1_56">pretend; you cannot respect. </div>
<div id="t13_56" class="t s1_56">And if you think sex is a problem, a disease, something to get rid of, will you be able to </div>
<div id="t14_56" class="t s1_56">love your children? How can you love your children? They come out of a problem, out of </div>
<div id="t15_56" class="t s1_56">a disease. You will hate them. You may pretend that you love them, but you know that </div>
<div id="t16_56" class="t s1_56">they are actualizations of your problem. They will always indicate you as a sexual being. </div>
<div id="t17_56" class="t s1_56">They will always go on as a proof in the world that you were animalistic, that you could </div>
<div id="t18_56" class="t s1_56">not get beyond sex. They will be a proof, a permanent proof of your degradedness. </div>
