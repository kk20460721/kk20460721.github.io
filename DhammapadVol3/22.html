<div id="t2_22" class="t s1_22">doubt you will find the other side is trust -- as if the coin becomes transparent and you </div>
<div id="t3_22" class="t s1_22">can see this side and you can also see the other side. Then watching trust you will be </div>
<div id="t4_22" class="t s1_22">able to see doubt hiding behind it. That moment is of great realization: when seeing that </div>
<div id="t5_22" class="t s1_22">doubt is trust, that trust is doubt, you become free from both. Suddenly a </div>
<div id="t6_22" class="t s1_22">transcendence! You are no longer attached to either, your bondage is finished. You are </div>
<div id="t7_22" class="t s1_22">no longer caught in the duality, and when you are no longer caught in duality, you are </div>
<div id="t8_22" class="t s1_22">not part of the mind at all -- mind is left far behind. You are simply a pure </div>
<div id="t9_22" class="t s1_22">consciousness. And to know pure consciousness is to know real beauty, real blessing, </div>
<div id="ta_22" class="t s1_22">real benediction. </div>
<div id="tb_22" class="t s1_22">If you want to call that state "trust," then you will be understanding my language. I call </div>
<div id="tc_22" class="t s1_22">that state trust which knows nothing of doubt, not even a shadow of doubt. </div>
<div id="td_22" class="t s1_22">But of course I am using language in such a way that no linguist will agree with. But </div>
<div id="te_22" class="t s1_22">that's how it has always been. The mystic has something to say to you which cannot be </div>
<div id="tf_22" class="t s1_22">said. And the mystic has to communicate to you something which is incommunicable. </div>
<div id="tg_22" class="t s1_22">The problem for the mystic is: what to do? He has something, and it is so much that he </div>
<div id="th_22" class="t s1_22">would like to share it -- he has to share it. Sharing is inevitable, it cannot be avoided. It </div>
<div id="ti_22" class="t s1_22">is like a cloud full of rainwater: it has to rain, it has to shower. It is like a flower full of </div>
<div id="tj_22" class="t s1_22">fragrance: the fragrance has to be released to the winds. It is like a lamp in the dark </div>
<div id="tk_22" class="t s1_22">night -- the light has to dispel the darkness. </div>
<div id="tl_22" class="t s1_22">Whenever someone becomes enlightened, he becomes a cloud full of rainwater. Buddha </div>
<div id="tm_22" class="t s1_22">has called the man of enlightenment one who has attained MEGHASAMADHI -- </div>

<div id="to_22" class="t s1_22">attained the cloud of ultimate consciousness. Why does he use the word 'cloud'? -- </div>
<div id="tp_22" class="t s1_22">because of this intrinsic necessity to shower. A man who is enlightened becomes a </div>
<div id="tq_22" class="t s1_22">flower which has opened. The mystics in the East have called the ultimate opening of </div>
<div id="tr_22" class="t s1_22">your heart, of your being, of your consciousness, SAHASRAR -- one-thousand-petaled </div>

<div id="tt_22" class="t s1_22">fragrance? It is natural, spontaneous; it starts spreading into the winds. </div>
<div id="tu_22" class="t s1_22">A buddha is a man whose heart is full of light; a buddha is one who has become a </div>
<div id="tv_22" class="t s1_22">flame, an eternal flame which cannot be extinguished. Now it is bound to dispel </div>
<div id="tw_22" class="t s1_22">darkness. But the problem is: how to give the message? </div>
<div id="tx_22" class="t s1_22">You have a language which is based on duality and he has an experience which is </div>
<div id="ty_22" class="t s1_22">rooted in nonduality. You are on the earth, he is in the sky. The distance is infinite... but </div>
<div id="tz_22" class="t s1_22">it has to be bridged. And you cannot bridge it, only a buddha can bridge it. You know </div>

<div id="t11_22" class="t s1_22">experience. But he knows both! He knows your darkness because he has lived in that </div>
<div id="t12_22" class="t s1_22">darkness himself. He knows your misery because he has passed through it and he </div>
<div id="t13_22" class="t s1_22">knows now the bliss of ultimate attainment. Now he knows what God is. Only he can </div>
<div id="t14_22" class="t s1_22">manage to bridge, only he can manage to create some links between you and him. </div>
<div id="t15_22" class="t s1_22">Language is the most important link between humanity and the buddha. In fact, </div>
<div id="t16_22" class="t s1_22">language is the most distinctive characteristic of human beings; no other animals use </div>
