<div id="t1_38" class="t s1_38">CHAPTER 1.</div>
<div id="t2_38" class="t s2_38">The Prime Minister of a monarch died. He had before him the intricate problem of ﬁnding the most</div>
<div id="t3_38" class="t s2_38">intelligent person of the state and making him the Prime Minister. Then after several types of tests,</div>
<div id="t4_38" class="t s2_38">ultimately three persons were selected. Now, out of the three also one had to be selected. One day,</div>
<div id="t5_38" class="t s2_38">before the selection test a rumour went round that the monarch was going to shut them in a room</div>
<div id="t6_38" class="t s2_38">on the door of which a wonderful lock, prepared by the best mechanics of the state, was to be ﬁxed</div>
<div id="t7_38" class="t s2_38">and it could be opened only by the person most efﬁcient in arithmetic. out of the three persons, two</div>
<div id="t8_38" class="t s2_38">could not sleep that night on account of worry and excitement. They kept on studying throughout</div>
<div id="t9_38" class="t s2_38">the night books on locks and trying to memorise the numbers and formulae of arithmetic. Before the</div>
<div id="ta_38" class="t s2_38">day dawned, they were so much stuffed with arithmetic that it was perhaps impossible for them to</div>
<div id="tb_38" class="t s2_38">add two and two. While going to the palace, they also concealed under their clothes a few books on</div>
<div id="tc_38" class="t s2_38">arithmetic which could be needed any time. In their own esteem they were fully prepared, although</div>
<div id="td_38" class="t s2_38">on account of their keeping awake with the books throughout the night their minds were not under</div>
<div id="te_38" class="t s2_38">control and their feet were falling as if they were intoxicated. Treatises and knowledge also have</div>
<div id="tf_38" class="t s2_38">their own intoxications. But to both of them the third person, who had slept peacefully at night, was</div>
<div id="tg_38" class="t s2_38">deﬁnitely looking mad. What else could his carefreeness indicate except madness? Both of them</div>
<div id="th_38" class="t s2_38">had been laughing, and were still laughing, on his foolishness. On reaching the palace they came</div>
<div id="ti_38" class="t s2_38">to know that the rumour was surely true. Immediately on arrival they were shut into a big room on</div>
<div id="tj_38" class="t s2_38">the door of which that much-talked about lock was ﬁxed which was a superb invention of mechanical</div>
<div id="tk_38" class="t s2_38">intelligence of the time. That lock was prepared on the basis of arithmetic and that was like a very</div>
<div id="tl_38" class="t s2_38">difﬁcult puzzle which could be solved only through arithmetic. All these things were known through</div>
<div id="tm_38" class="t s2_38">rumours, and the arithmetical ﬁgures and remarks made on the lock also announced the same thing.</div>
<div id="tn_38" class="t s2_38">After being shut in the room those three persons were made aware af the decision of the monarch</div>
<div id="to_38" class="t s2_38">that whoever opened that lock and was able to come out ﬁrst would be appointed to the position of</div>
<div id="tp_38" class="t s2_38">Prime Minister. Those two persons immediately started reading the marks on the lock and started</div>
<div id="tq_38" class="t s2_38">using arithmetical ﬁgures. In between, they were also using the books which they had brought. It</div>
<div id="tr_38" class="t s2_38">was winter season and from the big ventilators of the room cold wind of the morn was coming in. But</div>
<div id="ts_38" class="t s2_38">their foreheads were sweating. The time was short, the problem of opening the lock was hard and in</div>
<div id="tt_38" class="t s2_38">a short while the luck of their life was to be decided. Their hands were trembling and their breathing</div>
<div id="tu_38" class="t s2_38">was fast. They were writing one thing and producing something else. But the person who had slept</div>
<div id="tv_38" class="t s2_38">throughout night neither studied the lock, nor lifted his pen, nor solved any arithmetic. He was sitting</div>
<div id="tw_38" class="t s2_38">patiently with his eyes shut. His face had neither any worry nor any excitement. On looking at him</div>
<div id="tx_38" class="t s2_38">one could not feel that he was thinking about some thing. His fullness and thoughts looked a steady</div>
<div id="ty_38" class="t s2_38">ﬂame of the lamp in a room where there was no wind. He was absolutely calm, silent and blank.</div>
<div id="tz_38" class="t s2_38">But then suddenly he got up and with extremely natural and calm appearance he moved slowly to</div>
<div id="t10_38" class="t s2_38">the gate of the room. Then very slowly he turned the handle of the door and it was surprising that,</div>
<div id="t11_38" class="t s2_38">the door fell open. That lock was all the story connected with it a deception. But his two friends</div>
<div id="t12_38" class="t s2_38">who were solving the arithmetical puzzles knew nothing about it. They did not even know that one of</div>
<div id="t13_38" class="t s2_38">their friends was no longer inside. This astonishing truth was known by them only when the monarch</div>
<div id="t14_38" class="t s2_38">came inside and said: ”Gentlemen, now stop this arithmetic. He who had to come out has already</div>
<div id="t15_38" class="t s2_38">come.” Those poor chaps were not able to trust their own eyes. Their friend who was undeserving in</div>
<div id="t16_38" class="t s2_38">all respects, was standing behind the monarch. Finding them without words, the monarch also told</div>
<div id="t17_38" class="t s2_38">them: ”Even in life this is of primary importance that we should ﬁrst of all ﬁnd out whether a problem</div>
<div id="t18_38" class="t s2_38">really exists or not, whether the lock is actually closed or not. He who does not ﬁnd out the problem</div>
<div id="t19_38" class="t s2_38">and gets involved in solving it is naturally misled and is miscarried for ever.”</div>
<div id="t1a_38" class="t s2_38">This story is strangely true.</div>
<div id="t1b_38" class="t s2_38">The Earthen Lamps</div>
<div id="t1c_38" class="t s2_38">38</div>
<div id="t1d_38" class="t s3_38">Osho</div>
