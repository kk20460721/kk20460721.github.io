<div id="t1_140" class="t s1_140">This is my suggestion: there is no need to be worried -- the world is vast, and </div>
<div id="t2_140" class="t s1_140">everybody is free to choose, should be free to choose. If somebody feels that he is </div>
<div id="t3_140" class="t s1_140">attaining something with Moon -- and Moon may be wrong, as far as I know he </div>
<div id="t4_140" class="t s1_140">is wrong -- but even then if somebody follows him I am not going to distract the </div>
<div id="t5_140" class="t s1_140">person. This is my attitude -- that he is wrong. Even if he is wrong somebody </div>
<div id="t6_140" class="t s1_140">may be benefited by him. Life is very mysterious -- you learn by your errors also. </div>
<div id="t7_140" class="t s1_140">I know many people, like Muktananda, who have nothing to give. It is a miracle </div>
<div id="t8_140" class="t s1_140">that Muktananda can also become a guru. But still if somebody is following </div>
<div id="t9_140" class="t s1_140">Muktananda, I will not say don't follow him. I will say go headlong. Because that </div>
<div id="ta_140" class="t s1_140">is the only way to find out, to figure it out. I will say, 'Go headlong with open </div>
<div id="tb_140" class="t s1_140">eyes; maybe this is how your life is going to grow.' Nothing is wrong in it. Why </div>
<div id="tc_140" class="t s1_140">be so much afraid? </div>
<div id="td_140" class="t s1_140">One learns from fools as much as from wise people, and one learns from pseudo-</div>
<div id="te_140" class="t s1_140">gurus as much as from authentic gurus. They are part of one phenomenon. In </div>
<div id="tf_140" class="t s1_140">fact, you get that which you deserve. Now there are a few people who deserve </div>
<div id="tg_140" class="t s1_140">Muktananda. What to do? They have earned Muktananda through their lives; </div>
<div id="th_140" class="t s1_140">many lives of karmas and they have earned Muktananda. Now who am I or who </div>
<div id="ti_140" class="t s1_140">are you to prevent them? Why? They deserve, that is their growth, they have to </div>
<div id="tj_140" class="t s1_140">pass through it. </div>
<div id="tk_140" class="t s1_140">One day Mulla Nasrudin came to me and he was very much worried and he </div>
<div id="tl_140" class="t s1_140">said, 'I would like to become a guru myself.' </div>
<div id="tm_140" class="t s1_140">I was intrigued. I said, 'There are good opportunities. Why not? You try.' </div>
<div id="tn_140" class="t s1_140">He said, 'Yes, that's what I'm thinking. If Muktananda of Ganeshpuri can become </div>
<div id="to_140" class="t s1_140">a guru, why not I?' And then he said, 'Osho, there is one request. You supply me </div>
<div id="tp_140" class="t s1_140">with my first disciple.' </div>
<div id="tq_140" class="t s1_140">A man was sitting by the side who suffers from an inferiority complex and he </div>
<div id="tr_140" class="t s1_140">has seen psychoanalysts -- Freudians, Jungians, Adlerians -- and he has defeated </div>
<div id="ts_140" class="t s1_140">all of them, and he goes on suffering with inferiority complex. In fact he has </div>
<div id="tt_140" class="t s1_140">become more skilled in it. The more he has been psychoanalysed, the more he </div>
<div id="tu_140" class="t s1_140">has become skilful about it. In fact, he is enjoying it. </div>
<div id="tv_140" class="t s1_140">So I told Nasrudin, 'You take this man. Try -- this man suffers from inferiority </div>
<div id="tw_140" class="t s1_140">complex.' Nasrudin took him away, sat with him, looked into his eyes, meditated </div>
<div id="tx_140" class="t s1_140">a little, closed his eyes, and then told him finally, 'I have good news for you. You </div>
<div id="ty_140" class="t s1_140">have no inferiority complex, you really are inferior.' </div>
<div id="tz_140" class="t s1_140">Now there are people who really are inferior. They deserve Muktanandas, </div>
<div id="t10_140" class="t s1_140">Moons, and that type of people. There are stupid people. What to do? Stupid </div>
<div id="t11_140" class="t s1_140">gurus are also needed. Stupid gurus cannot disappear from the world unless </div>
<div id="t12_140" class="t s1_140">stupid people disappear. It is a subtle economic law. Your demand has to be </div>
<div id="t13_140" class="t s1_140">fulfilled, somebody from somewhere has to supply goods that you need. </div>
<div id="t14_140" class="t s1_140">People think as if it is only just Moon or people who are exploiting. No, you want </div>
<div id="t15_140" class="t s1_140">to be exploited, you cannot rest unless you are exploited. People think that </div>
