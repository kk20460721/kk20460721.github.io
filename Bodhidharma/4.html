<div id="t1_4" class="t s1_4">successor, to be the emperor of the great Pallavas empire, but you have chosen </div>
<div id="t2_4" class="t s1_4">something higher than that. I am your father so how can I prevent you? </div>
<div id="t3_4" class="t s1_4">"And you have put in such a simple way a question which I had never expected. </div>
<div id="t4_4" class="t s1_4">You say, `If you can prevent my death then I will not leave the palace, but if you </div>
<div id="t5_4" class="t s1_4">cannot prevent my death, then please don't prevent me either.'" You can see </div>
<div id="t6_4" class="t s1_4">Bodhidharma's caliber as a great intelligence. </div>
<div id="t7_4" class="t s1_4">And the second thing that I would like you to remember is that although he was </div>
<div id="t8_4" class="t s1_4">a follower of Gautam Buddha, in some instances he shows higher flights than </div>
<div id="t9_4" class="t s1_4">Gautam Buddha himself. For example, Gautam Buddha was afraid to initiate a </div>
<div id="ta_4" class="t s1_4">woman into his commune of sannyasins but Bodhidharma got initiated by a </div>
<div id="tb_4" class="t s1_4">woman who was enlightened. Her name was Pragyatara. Perhaps people would </div>
<div id="tc_4" class="t s1_4">have forgotten her name; it is only because of Bodhidharma that her name still </div>
<div id="td_4" class="t s1_4">remains, but only the name -- we don't know anything else about her. It was she </div>
<div id="te_4" class="t s1_4">who ordered Bodhidharma to go to China. Buddhism had reached China six </div>
<div id="tf_4" class="t s1_4">hundred years before Bodhidharma. It was something magical; it had never </div>
<div id="tg_4" class="t s1_4">happened anywhere, at any time -- Buddha's message immediately caught hold </div>
<div id="th_4" class="t s1_4">of the whole Chinese people. </div>
<div id="ti_4" class="t s1_4">The situation was that China had lived under the influence of Confucius and was </div>
<div id="tj_4" class="t s1_4">tired of it. Because Confucius is just a moralist, a puritan, he does not know </div>
<div id="tk_4" class="t s1_4">anything about the inner mysteries of life. In fact, he denies that there is anything </div>
<div id="tl_4" class="t s1_4">inner. Everything is outer; refine it, polish it, culture it, make it as beautiful as </div>
<div id="tm_4" class="t s1_4">possible. </div>
<div id="tn_4" class="t s1_4">There were people like Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, contemporaries of </div>
<div id="to_4" class="t s1_4">Confucius, but they were mystics not masters. They could not create a counter </div>
<div id="tp_4" class="t s1_4">movement against Confucius in the hearts of the Chinese people. So there was a </div>
<div id="tq_4" class="t s1_4">vacuum. Nobody can live without a soul, and once you start thinking that there </div>
<div id="tr_4" class="t s1_4">is no soul, your life starts losing all meaning. The soul is your very integrating </div>
<div id="ts_4" class="t s1_4">concept; without it you are cut away from existence and eternal life. Just like a </div>
<div id="tt_4" class="t s1_4">branch cut off from a tree is bound to die -- it has lost the source of nourishment -</div>
<div id="tu_4" class="t s1_4">- the very idea that there is no soul inside you, no consciousness, cuts you away </div>
<div id="tv_4" class="t s1_4">from existence. One starts shrinking, one starts feeling suffocated. </div>
<div id="tw_4" class="t s1_4">But Confucius was a very great rationalist. These mystics, Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, </div>
<div id="tx_4" class="t s1_4">Lieh Tzu, knew that what Confucius was doing was wrong, but they were not </div>
<div id="ty_4" class="t s1_4">masters. They remained in their monasteries with their few disciples. </div>
<div id="tz_4" class="t s1_4">When Buddhism reached China, it immediately entered to the very soul of the </div>
<div id="t10_4" class="t s1_4">people... as if they had been thirsty for centuries, and Buddhism had come as a </div>
<div id="t11_4" class="t s1_4">rain cloud. It quenched their thirst so immensely that something unimaginable </div>
<div id="t12_4" class="t s1_4">happened. </div>
<div id="t13_4" class="t s1_4">Christianity has converted many people, but that conversion is not worth calling </div>
<div id="t14_4" class="t s1_4">religious. It converts the poor, the hungry, the beggars, the orphans, not by any </div>
<div id="t15_4" class="t s1_4">spiritual impact on them but just by giving them food, clothes, shelter, education. </div>
<div id="t16_4" class="t s1_4">But these have nothing to do with spirituality. Mohammedanism has converted a </div>
