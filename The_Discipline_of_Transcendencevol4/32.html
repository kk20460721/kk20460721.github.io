<div id="t3_32" class="t s1_32">Then there are two types of poor people: a poor person who has no riches, and a </div>
<div id="t4_32" class="t s1_32">poor person who has all the riches in the world. If the poor person has </div>
<div id="t5_32" class="t s1_32">understood that there is no meaning in riches, and the person who has all the </div>
<div id="t6_32" class="t s1_32">riches has also understood that there is no meaning in riches, then both are poor </div>
<div id="t7_32" class="t s1_32">in spirit. The basic thing to realize is that whatsoever is outside is not going to </div>
<div id="t8_32" class="t s1_32">fulfill you. Whether you are rich or poor does not matter. But, it is easier</div>
<div id="t9_32" class="t s1_32">....</div>
<div id="ta_32" class="t s1_32">That's why I said that if a poor man wants to be religious, he will have to have </div>
<div id="tb_32" class="t s1_32">more intelligence than the rich man -- because he will have to substitute by his </div>
<div id="tc_32" class="t s1_32">intelligence what is lacking in riches. He will have to have a great vision, </div>
<div id="td_32" class="t s1_32">visualization power. If you have a beautiful woman, it is very easy to understand </div>
<div id="te_32" class="t s1_32">that just by having a beautiful woman by your side, no contentment comes. It is </div>

<div id="tl_32" class="t s1_32">not even something to eat, no house to give you shelter, it is very difficult to see </div>
<div id="tm_32" class="t s1_32">that houses, food, money, are all meaningless. It is very difficult for a poor man </div>
<div id="tn_32" class="t s1_32">to understand that money is meaningless. For a rich man, it is very simple. </div>
