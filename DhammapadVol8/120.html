<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">Man ordinarily is a robot. He lives apparently awake, but not really. He walks, he talks, </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">he acts, but it is all as if in sleep -- not conscious of what he is doing, not conscious of </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">what he is saying, not conscious of all that surrounds him. He moves surrounded in a </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">dark cloud of unawareness. </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">According to Gautama the Buddha, this is the original sin: to live unconsciously, to act </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">out of unconsciousness. </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">In fact, the word 'sin' comes from a root which means forgetfulness. Sin simply means </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">that we are not conscious, aware, alert, that we don't have any inner light to guide us. </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">Buddha talks again and again in these sutras about falling into darkness, but you can </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">fall into darkness only if your inside is full of darkness. Whatsoever is your inside is </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">going to be your destiny. If the inner is full of light, the whole existence is full of light. If </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">the inner is dark, then of course it is nothing but a dark night of the soul all around. You </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">live through your inner core, so whatsoever is the case with your center is going to be </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">reflected by your circumference. The whole world only reflects you, echoes you, </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">resounds you. It is nothing but you multiplied a millionfold. So if you come across </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">ugliness, it must be somewhere inside you. If you meet the enemy, you must have </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">projected it. If you see death, that means something in you is rotten, something in you </div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">with which you have become identified corresponds to death. </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">The world is a mirror; it always shows your real face to you. Buddha insists again and </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">again: Use the world as a mirror, and then go inside and find out the cause. The cause is </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">always in the inner; the effect is in the outer. Don't be deceived by the effect. Don't start </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">thinking that the effect is the cause because then you will be leading a life rooted in </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">utter ignorance. The face in the mirror is not the cause; the face in the mirror is only the </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">effect. Don't try to change the face in the mirror, don't try to paint it. </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">That's what we go on doing; that's what our whole life consists of. We are always trying </div>

<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">the point of convincing anybody? In fact, by convincing others we are trying to </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">convince ourselves. If the others are convinced -- if the mirror can reflect a beautiful face </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">-- than we can be at ease with ourselves. We can also believe that we are beautiful. </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">This is the illusion in which we live, and this is the illusion that the society helps to </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">strengthen. The society feeds it, the society nourishes it. The whole effort of the society </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">is to make the mirror more important than yourself, because then you can be </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">dominated, you can be reduced to slaves. And the mirror is in others' hands. </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">Somebody says to you, "You are so holy!" If you believe him, if this becomes an ego </div>
