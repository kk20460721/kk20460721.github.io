<div id="t2_123" class="t s1_123">prevalent. There are reasons. I would like to tell you a few. </div>
<div id="t3_123" class="t s1_123">Animals, in their wild state, are never homosexual; but in zoos they turn. In their wild </div>
<div id="t4_123" class="t s1_123">states animals are never homosexual, but in zoos, where they are not free and don't have </div>

<div id="t7_123" class="t s1_123">people are becoming too tense. That is one of the causes of homosexuality growing. </div>
<div id="t8_123" class="t s1_123">The second thing. In the West sex is thought to be more like fun than a commitment. One </div>
<div id="t9_123" class="t s1_123">wants to have casual affairs. To get involved with a woman is to get into troubled waters. </div>
<div id="ta_123" class="t s1_123">To get involved with a woman means a great involvement children, family, job, house, </div>
<div id="tb_123" class="t s1_123">car, and a thousand and one things. Once the woman enters in, the whole world enters in. </div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s1_123">The Western mind is becoming more and more afraid of getting involved; people would </div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s1_123">like to remain uninvolved. It is easier to be uninvolved in a homosexual relationship than </div>

<div id="tf_123" class="t s1_123">almost none. </div>
<div id="tg_123" class="t s1_123">The third reason. Women are becoming lesbians in the West because of the lib </div>
<div id="th_123" class="t s1_123">movement, the idea that man has oppressed women up to now. And man has oppressed; it </div>
<div id="ti_123" class="t s1_123">has been one of the greatest slaveries ever. No other class has been oppressed as much as </div>
<div id="tj_123" class="t s1_123">women. Now the revolt, the reaction. There are organizations of Western women which </div>
<div id="tk_123" class="t s1_123">promote lesbianism, homosexuality -- get out of all relationships with men. Forget loving </div>
<div id="tl_123" class="t s1_123">the enemy. Man is the enemy; get out of all relationships with men. It is better to love a </div>

<div id="tn_123" class="t s1_123">Women are getting more and more aggressive. Man is getting more and more afraid of </div>
<div id="to_123" class="t s1_123">getting into relationship. </div>
<div id="tp_123" class="t s1_123">These situations are creating homosexuality, but it is a perversion. If you are in it, I don't </div>

<div id="tr_123" class="t s1_123">you will see that your homosexuality is turning into heterosexuality. If you are </div>

<div id="tu_123" class="t s1_123">heterosexual, I would like you to become celibates; that is better. But go on. </div>
<div id="tv_123" class="t s1_123">I don't condemn anything. </div>
<div id="tw_123" class="t s1_123">The questioner says, "... homosexuality did and does exist in the world." Right. </div>
<div id="tx_123" class="t s1_123">Tuberculosis also did exist and exists, cancer also, but that is no reason for it. A really </div>
