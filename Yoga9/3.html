<div id="t2_3" class="t s1_3">can be taken of the energy body. They call it bioplasma, but it exactly means prana. The </div>
<div id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">energy, elan vital, or what Taoists call chi, it can be photographed now. Now it has </div>
<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">become almost scientific. </div>
<div id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">And one very great discovery has been done in Soviet Russia, and that is before your </div>
<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">physical body suffers some illness, the energy body suffers it -- six months before. Then </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">it happens to the physical body. If you are going to have tuberculosis, or cancer, or any </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">illness, your energy body starts showing indications of it six months before. No </div>
<div id="t9_3" class="t s1_3">examination, no testing of the physical body shows anything, but the electric body starts </div>
<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">showing it. First it appears in the pranamaya kosha, then it enters into the annamaya </div>
<div id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">kosha. So now they say that it has become possible to treat a person before he has fallen </div>
<div id="tc_3" class="t s1_3">ill. Once it becomes so, then there is no need for humanity to fall ill. Before you will </div>
<div id="td_3" class="t s1_3">become aware that you are ill, your photographs by Kirlian methods will show that some </div>
<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">illness is going to happen to your physical body. It can be prevented in the pranamaya </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">kosha. </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">That's why yoga insists very much on the purity of breathing, because the pranamaya </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">kosha is made of a subtle energy that travels inside you with the breathing. If you breathe </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">rightly, your pranamaya kosha remains healthy and whole and alive. Such a person never </div>

<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">responsive, always ready to respond to the moment, ready to take the challenge. He is </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">always ready. You will never find him unprepared for any moment. Not that he plans for </div>

<div id="to_3" class="t s1_3">works on pranamaya kosha. </div>
<div id="tp_3" class="t s1_3">And if you know just how to breathe naturally, you will grow into your second body. And </div>
<div id="tq_3" class="t s1_3">the second body is stronger than the first. And the second body lives longer than the first. </div>
<div id="tr_3" class="t s1_3">When somebody dies, for almost three days you can see his bioplasma. Sometimes that is </div>
<div id="ts_3" class="t s1_3">mistaken for his ghost. The physical body dies, but the energy body continues to move. </div>
<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">And those who have experimented deeply about death, they say that for three days it is </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">very difficult for the person who has died to believe that he has died because the same </div>
<div id="tv_3" class="t s1_3">form -- and more vital than ever, more healthy than ever, more beautiful than ever -- </div>
<div id="tw_3" class="t s1_3">surrounds him. It depends on how big a bioplasma you have; then it can continue for </div>
<div id="tx_3" class="t s1_3">thirteen days or even for more. </div>
<div id="ty_3" class="t s1_3">Around the samadhis of yogis</div>
<div id="tz_3" class="t s1_3">....</div>
<div id="t10_3" class="t s1_3">In India we burn everybody's body except the body of </div>
<div id="t11_3" class="t s1_3">one who has attained to samadhi. We don't burn his body, for a certain reason. Once you </div>
<div id="t12_3" class="t s1_3">burn the body, the bioplasma starts moving away from the earth. You can feel it for a few </div>
<div id="t13_3" class="t s1_3">days, but then it disappears into the cosmos. But if the physical body is left, then the </div>
<div id="t14_3" class="t s1_3">bioplasma can cling to it. And a man who has attained samadhi, who has become </div>
<div id="t15_3" class="t s1_3">enlightened, if his bioplasma can remain somewhere around his samadhi, many people </div>
<div id="t16_3" class="t s1_3">will be benefited by it. That's how many people come to see their gurus' forms. </div>
<div id="t17_3" class="t s1_3">In Aurobindo ashram, Aurobindo's body is put in a samadhi, not destroyed, not burned. </div>
<div id="t18_3" class="t s1_3">Many people have felt as if they have seen Aurobindo around it. Or sometimes they have </div>
<div id="t19_3" class="t s1_3">heard the same footsteps the way Aurobindo used to walk. And sometimes he is there just </div>
<div id="t1a_3" class="t s1_3">standing before them. This is not Aurobindo; this is the bioplasma. Aurobindo is gone, </div>
<div id="t1b_3" class="t s1_3">but the bioplasma, the pranamaya kosha, can persist for centuries. If the person has been </div>
<div id="t1c_3" class="t s1_3">really in tune with his pranamaya kosha, it can persist. It can have its own eXistence. </div>
