<div id="t2_204" class="t s1_204">them, "I know that you are going to sell me, but let me tell you one thing: if you </div>
<div id="t3_204" class="t s1_204">listen to me, you can get the highest price possible. I know my price, you don't </div>

<div id="td_204" class="t s1_204">that he was right: "We have a very precious man." And this continued the whole </div>

<div id="tv_204" class="t s1_204">It simply goes on inferring about truth, guessing. Mind is guesswork. </div>
