<div id="t2_337" class="t s2_337">can forgive politicians, it can forgive any kind of person in the world, but it cannot forgive a man who</div>
<div id="t3_337" class="t s2_337">has an individuality of his own, who is not part of the collective mind.</div>
<div id="t4_337" class="t s2_337">It reminds me of the cruciﬁxion of Jesus.</div>
<div id="t5_337" class="t s2_337">The man was absolutely harmless.</div>
<div id="t6_337" class="t s2_337">He had not done</div>
<div id="t7_337" class="t s2_337">anything wrong to anybody, he was not a criminal. And the governor general of Judea was Roman,</div>
<div id="t8_337" class="t s2_337">he was not a Jew. Judea was under the Roman Empire. And every year at the annual festival of the</div>
<div id="t9_337" class="t s2_337">Jews, they were allowed to forgive one person from all the persons who were going to be murdered</div>
<div id="ta_337" class="t s2_337">on that day. On that day it was decided, for all the criminals who had been sentenced to death.</div>
<div id="tb_337" class="t s2_337">Millions of people gathered in Jerusalem and it was a great entertainment to see people cruciﬁed –</div>
<div id="tc_337" class="t s2_337">such is the barbarous instinct in the crowd.</div>
<div id="td_337" class="t s2_337">Governor General Pontius Pilate was perfectly aware that this young man, Jesus, was not a criminal.</div>
<div id="te_337" class="t s2_337">But the whole crowd of the Jews, their priests, the high priest, were unanimously asking that</div>
<div id="tf_337" class="t s2_337">he should be cruciﬁed.</div>
<div id="tg_337" class="t s2_337">He tried to persuade the priests, but they were absolutely deaf to any</div>
<div id="th_337" class="t s2_337">persuasion. Finally Pontius Pilate talked to Jesus and felt immensely sorry for the young man. He</div>
<div id="ti_337" class="t s2_337">was only thirty-three, he had not seen more than thirty-three springs in his life, and it was absolutely</div>
<div id="tj_337" class="t s2_337">unjust.</div>
<div id="tk_337" class="t s2_337">But Pontius Pilate was a politician – and the politician knows nothing about justice or injustice, right</div>
<div id="tl_337" class="t s2_337">or wrong; he always thinks in terms of power. Everything is decided to help him to be in power. He</div>
<div id="tm_337" class="t s2_337">was afraid that if he refused to crucify this young, harmless, innocent person, his political career</div>
<div id="tn_337" class="t s2_337">would be jeopardized. All the Jews would appeal to the Roman emperor that this man should be</div>
<div id="to_337" class="t s2_337">removed from Judea. His whole career, respect, power, richness – in Judea he was almost the king</div>
<div id="tp_337" class="t s2_337">– were at risk. But still he tried his best; he talked with Jesus and he became even more convinced</div>
<div id="tq_337" class="t s2_337">that Jesus was innocent.</div>
<div id="tr_337" class="t s2_337">There was only one hope – because there were two other criminals to be cruciﬁed with Jesus Christ:</div>
<div id="ts_337" class="t s2_337">he would ask the crowd, ”Whom do you want to be forgiven?” And he hoped that for their own son,</div>
<div id="tt_337" class="t s2_337">utterly innocent, they would come to their senses and would ask that his life should be saved. And in</div>
<div id="tu_337" class="t s2_337">comparison to him the other two were as great criminals as there could be. One had committed three</div>
<div id="tv_337" class="t s2_337">murders, a few rapes; the other had committed seven murders, was a drunkard, was a nuisance. He</div>
<div id="tw_337" class="t s2_337">had been in the jail almost his whole life. He would come out and within two or three days he was</div>
<div id="tx_337" class="t s2_337">bound to do something and he would be back again – jail was his home.</div>
<div id="ty_337" class="t s2_337">His name was Barabbas; and when Pontius Pilate asked the crowd, ”Whom do you want to be</div>
<div id="tz_337" class="t s2_337">released on this religious festival, your festival, your national festival?” – with one voice, the crowd</div>
<div id="t10_337" class="t s2_337">shouted, ”Barabbas, we want Barabbas back.”</div>
<div id="t11_337" class="t s2_337">Even Barabbas could not believe it. Looking at this young man... he had heard about him that he</div>
<div id="t12_337" class="t s2_337">was absolutely innocent. Even he felt ashamed and guilty that he was being saved. And these idiots</div>
<div id="t13_337" class="t s2_337">who were shouting his name – he had harassed them his whole life! But Barabbas was saved and</div>
<div id="t14_337" class="t s2_337">Pontius Pilate, just out of frustration, went inside and washed his hands.</div>
<div id="t15_337" class="t s2_337">His washing of the hands had remained without any commentary until Sigmund Freud, almost two</div>
<div id="t16_337" class="t s2_337">thousand years later. Why did he wash his hands? Sigmund Freud, who was always looking deeper</div>
<div id="t17_337" class="t s2_337">into symbols, said that whenever people feel that they have done whatever they could do, then they</div>
<div id="t18_337" class="t s2_337">wash their hands of it completely; they are no more a part of it.</div>
<div id="t19_337" class="t s2_337">He was not responsible for the</div>
<div id="t1a_337" class="t s2_337">The Rebel</div>
<div id="t1b_337" class="t s2_337">337</div>
