<div id="t1_214" class="t s1_214">CHAPTER 12. IN THE HOUSE OF THE MOON</div>
<div id="t2_214" class="t s2_214">So Ananda said, ”I am going to be your disciple. Before I become your disciple, as your elder brother</div>
<div id="t3_214" class="t s2_214">I want one promise. Right now I am your elder brother and I can order you” – the old Indian tradition</div>
<div id="t4_214" class="t s2_214">– ”you are my younger brother and I can say this to you. You have to give me this promise, that you</div>
<div id="t5_214" class="t s2_214">will never tell me to leave you. I will stay with you; wherever you go I will be with you. I will follow you</div>
<div id="t6_214" class="t s2_214">like a shadow, I will serve you like a shadow. Even in the night I will be sleeping just by your side,</div>
<div id="t7_214" class="t s2_214">continuously ready to serve you.”</div>
<div id="t8_214" class="t s2_214">Buddha promised. And Ananda lived with Buddha for forty years. No other disciple lived so close.</div>
<div id="t9_214" class="t s2_214">But because he was so close he started taking Buddha for granted – naturally. He was so close, he</div>
<div id="ta_214" class="t s2_214">started forgetting Buddha. He was so close that he never tried what Buddha was saying. And the</div>
<div id="tb_214" class="t s2_214">day came when Buddha dropped his body...</div>
<div id="tc_214" class="t s2_214">Many who had come after Ananda had become enlightened. Ananda was not yet enlightened. He</div>
<div id="td_214" class="t s2_214">wept bitterly.</div>
<div id="te_214" class="t s2_214">His misery was great; there was no consolation.</div>
<div id="tf_214" class="t s2_214">Now suddenly he became aware</div>
<div id="tg_214" class="t s2_214">that forty years had been a wastage. ”I lived with this man – a rare opportunity, very rare. To ﬁnd a</div>
<div id="th_214" class="t s2_214">Buddha is rare, and to live with a Buddha for forty years continuously – it has not happened before,</div>
<div id="ti_214" class="t s2_214">it may not happen again. Forty years in a long time. And still I have missed.”</div>
<div id="tj_214" class="t s2_214">He stopped eating food, he stopped all kinds of other activities. He decided to become enlightened</div>
<div id="tk_214" class="t s2_214">before it was too late – it was already late. Day and night, he was trying to be aware...</div>
<div id="tl_214" class="t s2_214">And a great council was going to be arranged soon – all the enlightened disciples were going to</div>
<div id="tm_214" class="t s2_214">gather together to collect the sayings of Buddha. Ananda was not invited. And he was the most</div>
<div id="tn_214" class="t s2_214">reliable source, obviously – nobody had lived with Buddha so long, nobody had as much information</div>
<div id="to_214" class="t s2_214">as he had.</div>
<div id="tp_214" class="t s2_214">Nobody had listened to Buddha so much – morning and evening, day and night, he</div>
<div id="tq_214" class="t s2_214">was always there, just watching.</div>
<div id="tr_214" class="t s2_214">Whatsoever Buddha had said, he had heard it.</div>
<div id="ts_214" class="t s2_214">And he had a</div>
<div id="tt_214" class="t s2_214">miraculous memory, absolute memory – he had the power of absolute recall. But still he was not</div>
<div id="tu_214" class="t s2_214">invited to the council.</div>
<div id="tv_214" class="t s2_214">It was not possible to invite him. He had known Buddha, his word was reliable, his memory was</div>
<div id="tw_214" class="t s2_214">perfect – but he had no inner validity. He himself was not yet a Buddha. Yes, to collect facts he was</div>
<div id="tx_214" class="t s2_214">the right person. But what about truth? And facts and truths are different dimensions. A fact may be</div>
<div id="ty_214" class="t s2_214">a fact and yet may not be true. And a truth may be true, yet may not be a fact.</div>
<div id="tz_214" class="t s2_214">Truth is not the sum total of all the facts – truth is something more. Facts are mundane, superﬁcial.</div>
<div id="t10_214" class="t s2_214">Truths are not on the surface, they are inner. Ananda could say everything factual, but he had no</div>
<div id="t11_214" class="t s2_214">inner validity. He himself was not a witness. So even those who had not lived with Buddha were</div>
<div id="t12_214" class="t s2_214">called to the council, but not Ananda.</div>
<div id="t13_214" class="t s2_214">He worked hard, he staked all. Each moment he was trying to be aware, alert, mindful.</div>
<div id="t14_214" class="t s2_214">And the last night came – tomorrow morning the council was going to gather. Ananda was going</div>
<div id="t15_214" class="t s2_214">mad: it had not happened yet. He was becoming more and more tense and he was putting in all</div>
<div id="t16_214" class="t s2_214">that one could put, all that was humanly possible. He was ready to die for it.</div>
<div id="t17_214" class="t s2_214">The middle of the night had come and nothing had happened yet. And he was driving himself crazy.</div>
<div id="t18_214" class="t s2_214">For days he had not eaten, he had not slept, he had not taken a bath – there was no time to waste.</div>
<div id="t19_214" class="t s2_214">Take It Easy, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t1a_214" class="t s2_214">214</div>
<div id="t1b_214" class="t s3_214">Osho</div>
