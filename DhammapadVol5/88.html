<div id="t1_88" class="t s1_88">And I can understand -- if they recognize it, that will be a surprise to me. Their not </div>
<div id="t2_88" class="t s1_88">recognizing it is really recognizing it -- recognizing that it is a totally different kind of </div>
<div id="t3_88" class="t s1_88">institution, where people are not made knowledgeable but loving. </div>
<div id="t4_88" class="t s1_88">Humanity has lived with knowledge for centuries, and has lived in a very ugly way. </div>
<div id="t5_88" class="t s1_88">D.H. Lawrence once proposed that if for one hundred years all the universities and </div>
<div id="t6_88" class="t s1_88">colleges and schools were closed, humanity would be benefited immensely. </div>
<div id="t7_88" class="t s1_88">I agree with him totally. These two persons, Friedrich Nietzsche and D.H. Lawrence, </div>
<div id="t8_88" class="t s1_88">are beautiful people. It was unfortunate that they were born in the West; hence they </div>
<div id="t9_88" class="t s1_88">were not aware of Lao Tzu, of Chuang Tzu, of Buddha, of Bodhidharma, of Rinzai, of </div>
<div id="ta_88" class="t s1_88">Basho, of Kabir, of Meera. It is unfortunate that they knew only the Jewish and the </div>
<div id="tb_88" class="t s1_88">Christian tradition. And they were very much offended by the whole Jewish and </div>
<div id="tc_88" class="t s1_88">Christian approach towards life. It is very superficial. </div>
<div id="td_88" class="t s1_88">Friedrich Nietzsche used to sign himself, "Anti-Christ, Friedrich Nietzsche." First he </div>
<div id="te_88" class="t s1_88">would write "Anti-Christ." He was not really anti-Christ -- anti-Christian of course, </div>
<div id="tf_88" class="t s1_88">because in one of his saner moments he said that the first and the last Christian was </div>
<div id="tg_88" class="t s1_88">crucified -- he was Jesus Christ, the first and the last. </div>
<div id="th_88" class="t s1_88">But in his name something absolutely false is existing, and the day Christ was denied by </div>
<div id="ti_88" class="t s1_88">the Jews they became false. Since that ugly day they have not lived truly. How can you </div>
<div id="tj_88" class="t s1_88">live beautifully if you reject your own climaxes? What Moses had started, a beautiful </div>
<div id="tk_88" class="t s1_88">phenomenon, came to a climax in Jesus Christ, and the Jews rejected Jesus Christ. That </div>
<div id="tl_88" class="t s1_88">very day they rejected their own flowering, their own fragrance. Since that day they </div>
<div id="tm_88" class="t s1_88">have not been living rightly. </div>
<div id="tn_88" class="t s1_88">And the people who followed Jesus have created something absolutely against Jesus. If </div>
<div id="to_88" class="t s1_88">he comes back he will be nauseated, disgusted, seeing the Vatican and the pope and all </div>
<div id="tp_88" class="t s1_88">that goes on in the name of Christ. My own feeling is... somebody was asking me, "Jesus </div>
<div id="tq_88" class="t s1_88">promised to come back again -- will he come back?" </div>
<div id="tr_88" class="t s1_88">I told him, "If he comes back this time, you will not need to crucify him -- he will </div>
<div id="ts_88" class="t s1_88">commit suicide himself! Just seeing the Christians will be enough -- enough to commit </div>
<div id="tt_88" class="t s1_88">suicide. Hence my feeling is that he is not going to come. Once is enough, twice will be </div>
<div id="tu_88" class="t s1_88">too much." </div>
<div id="tv_88" class="t s1_88">But these two men, Nietzsche and Lawrence, were immensely misunderstood in the </div>
<div id="tw_88" class="t s1_88">West. They also provided reasons for being misunderstood; they were helpless, they </div>
<div id="tx_88" class="t s1_88">were groping in the dark. Of course their direction was right; had they been in the East </div>
<div id="ty_88" class="t s1_88">they would have become buddhas. They had the potential -- great potential, great </div>
<div id="tz_88" class="t s1_88">insight. I agree with them on many points. </div>
<div id="t10_88" class="t s1_88">D.H. Lawrence was very much against your so-called education -- it is not education, it </div>
<div id="t11_88" class="t s1_88">is mis-education. Real education can only be based on love, not on knowledge. Real </div>
<div id="t12_88" class="t s1_88">education cannot be utilitarian, real education cannot be of the marketplace. Not that </div>
<div id="t13_88" class="t s1_88">real education will not give you knowledge; first, real education will prepare your </div>
<div id="t14_88" class="t s1_88">heart, your love, and then whatever knowledge is needed to pass through life will be </div>
<div id="t15_88" class="t s1_88">given to you, but that will be secondary. And it will never be overpowering; it will not </div>
<div id="t16_88" class="t s1_88">be more valuable than love. </div>
