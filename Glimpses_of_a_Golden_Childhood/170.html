<div id="t1_170" class="t s1_170">CHAPTER 25.</div>
<div id="t2_170" class="t s2_170">they are listening, they are not listening, they are doing a thousand other things. Hypocrites just</div>
<div id="t3_170" class="t s2_170">pretending... but not the way an attentive listener should be – just all attention, just attention and</div>
<div id="t4_170" class="t s2_170">nothing else, just open. Attention is a feminine quality, and everybody who knows the art of attention,</div>
<div id="t5_170" class="t s2_170">of being attentive, becomes, in a certain sense, very feminine, very fragile, soft; so soft that you could</div>
<div id="t6_170" class="t s2_170">scratch him with just your nails.</div>
<div id="t7_170" class="t s2_170">My Nani would wait the whole day for the time when I would come back home to tell her stories.</div>
<div id="t8_170" class="t s2_170">And you will be surprised how, unknowingly, she prepared me for the job that I was going to do. It</div>
<div id="t9_170" class="t s2_170">was she who ﬁrst heard many of the stories that I have told you. It was her to whom I could tell any</div>
<div id="ta_170" class="t s2_170">nonsense without any fear.</div>
<div id="tb_170" class="t s2_170">The other person, Shambhu Babu, was totally different from my Nani. My Nani was very intuitive,</div>
<div id="tc_170" class="t s2_170">but not intellectual. Shambhu Babu was also intuitive, but intellectual too. He was an intellectual of</div>
<div id="td_170" class="t s2_170">the ﬁrst grade. I have come across many intellectuals, some famous and some very famous, but</div>
<div id="te_170" class="t s2_170">none of them came close to Shambhu Babu. He was really a great synthesis. Assagioli would have</div>
<div id="tf_170" class="t s2_170">loved the man. He had intuition plus intellect, and both not in small measure, but high peaks. He</div>
<div id="tg_170" class="t s2_170">also used to listen to me, and would wait all day until school had ﬁnished. Every day after school</div>
<div id="th_170" class="t s2_170">was his.</div>
<div id="ti_170" class="t s2_170">The moment I was released from the prison, my school, I would ﬁrst go to Shambhu Babu. He would</div>
<div id="tj_170" class="t s2_170">be ready with tea and a few sweets that he knew I liked. I mention it because people rarely think</div>
<div id="tk_170" class="t s2_170">of the other person. He always arranged things with the other person in mind. I have never seen</div>
<div id="tl_170" class="t s2_170">anybody bother about the other as he did. Most people, although they prepare for others, they do it</div>
<div id="tm_170" class="t s2_170">according to themselves really, forcing the other person to like what they themselves like.</div>
<div id="tn_170" class="t s2_170">That was not Shambhu Babu’s way.</div>
<div id="to_170" class="t s2_170">His thinking of the other was one of the things I loved and</div>
<div id="tp_170" class="t s2_170">respected in him. He always purchased things only after asking the shopkeepers what my Nani used</div>
<div id="tq_170" class="t s2_170">to buy. I came to know this only after he died. Then the shopkeepers told me, the sweetmakers too,</div>
<div id="tr_170" class="t s2_170">that ”Shambhu Babu always used to ask a strange question: ‘What does that old woman, who lives</div>
<div id="ts_170" class="t s2_170">there alone near the river – what does she purchase from you?’ We never bothered why he asked,</div>
<div id="tt_170" class="t s2_170">but now we know: he was inquiring about what you liked.”</div>
<div id="tu_170" class="t s2_170">I was also amazed that he was always ready with the very things that I liked. He was a man of the</div>
<div id="tv_170" class="t s2_170">law, so naturally he found a way. From school I would rush to his house, take my tea and sweets</div>
<div id="tw_170" class="t s2_170">that he had bought, then he was ready. Even before I had ﬁnished, he was ready to listen to what I</div>
<div id="tx_170" class="t s2_170">had to tell him. He would say, ”Just tell me anything you like. It’s not a question of what you say, but</div>
<div id="ty_170" class="t s2_170">that you say it.”</div>
<div id="tz_170" class="t s2_170">His emphasis was very clear. I was left absolutely free, with not even a subject to talk about, free to</div>
<div id="t10_170" class="t s2_170">say anything I wanted. He always added, ”If you want to remain silent, you can. I will listen to your</div>
<div id="t11_170" class="t s2_170">silence.” And once in a while it would happen that I would not say a single thing. There was nothing</div>
<div id="t12_170" class="t s2_170">to say.</div>
<div id="t13_170" class="t s2_170">And when I closed my eyes he too would close his eyes, and we would sit like the Quakers, just in</div>
<div id="t14_170" class="t s2_170">silence. There were so many times, day after day, when I either spoke or else we stayed in silence.</div>
<div id="t15_170" class="t s2_170">I once said to him, ”Shambhu Babu, it looks a little strange for you to listen to a child. It would be</div>
<div id="t16_170" class="t s2_170">more appropriate if you spoke and I listened.”</div>
<div id="t17_170" class="t s2_170">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t18_170" class="t s2_170">170</div>
<div id="t19_170" class="t s3_170">Osho</div>
