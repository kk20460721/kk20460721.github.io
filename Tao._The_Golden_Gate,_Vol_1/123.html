<div id="t1_123" class="t s1_123">CHAPTER 8. NOW HERE</div>
<div id="t2_123" class="t s2_123">This is one of the most famous Zen stories. I love it tremendously.</div>
<div id="t3_123" class="t s2_123">The thief was known as a master thief – no ordinary thief. Even the king respected him because</div>
<div id="t4_123" class="t s2_123">never in his life was he caught. And everybody knew that he was the greatest thief in the country. In</div>
<div id="t5_123" class="t s2_123">fact, his fame was such that people used to brag that ”Last night the master thief entered our house,”</div>
<div id="t6_123" class="t s2_123">that ”Our treasure has been stolen by the master thief.” It was a privilege because the entry of the</div>
<div id="t7_123" class="t s2_123">master thief meant you were really rich, because he would not go to any ordinary person, only kings</div>
<div id="t8_123" class="t s2_123">and very rich people had the privilege of the master thief visiting them.</div>
<div id="t9_123" class="t s2_123">The thief was becoming old. His son said to him, ”Now you are old and soon you will die. Teach me</div>
<div id="ta_123" class="t s2_123">your art!”</div>
<div id="tb_123" class="t s2_123">The master thief said, ”I was also thinking about it. But it is not an art, it is rather a knack. I cannot</div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s2_123">teach you, it cannot be taught, but it can be caught.”</div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s2_123">That’s how religion is: it cannot be taught, it can only be caught. That’s the difference between a</div>
<div id="te_123" class="t s2_123">teacher and a Master: the teacher teaches, the Master only makes himself available to be caught.</div>
<div id="tf_123" class="t s2_123">You have to imbibe his spirit. If you only listen to his words you will miss him; if you start tasting his</div>
<div id="tg_123" class="t s2_123">wine, only then will you understand him.</div>
<div id="th_123" class="t s2_123">The thief said, ”It is a knack; if you can catch it, I am ready to help you, I will make myself available</div>
<div id="ti_123" class="t s2_123">to you. I had been wondering myself, but it is such a great skill – like poets, real thieves are born not</div>
<div id="tj_123" class="t s2_123">made. But one never knows unless one tries. You come along with me tonight.”</div>
<div id="tk_123" class="t s2_123">The son followed. The son was young, healthy, very strong. The old man was really old, more than</div>
<div id="tl_123" class="t s2_123">eighty. The old man arrived at a rich house. He broke the wall, he removed the bricks – but the way</div>
<div id="tm_123" class="t s2_123">he was doing it! And the young man was just watching, standing there and trembling. It was a cold</div>
<div id="tn_123" class="t s2_123">night and the young man was perspiring and trembling. And he was so afraid: he was looking all</div>
<div id="to_123" class="t s2_123">around – somebody might be coming. ”And what kind of man is my father? He is doing everything</div>
<div id="tp_123" class="t s2_123">so silently, so gracefully, as if this was our own house! No hurry, no worry. ”</div>
<div id="tq_123" class="t s2_123">The father did not even look around even a single time. He entered the house, gestured to the son</div>
<div id="tr_123" class="t s2_123">to follow. He followed trembling, perspiring, his whole body was just bathed in perspiration; it was</div>
<div id="ts_123" class="t s2_123">ﬂowing like water. He had never experienced this kind of perspiration even on hot summer days –</div>
<div id="tt_123" class="t s2_123">and it was a cold winter night, ice cold! And the old man was moving in the house, in the darkness,</div>
<div id="tu_123" class="t s2_123">as if he had always lived there. He didn’t stumble against anything.</div>
<div id="tv_123" class="t s2_123">He reached inside the house, he opened the innermost room. Then he opened a closet and told</div>
<div id="tw_123" class="t s2_123">the son to enter the closet. The son entered the closet... and what the father did was unimaginable</div>
<div id="tx_123" class="t s2_123">to the son. The father locked the closet – the son was inside! – shouted loudly, ”Thief! Thief!” and</div>
<div id="ty_123" class="t s2_123">escaped.</div>
<div id="tz_123" class="t s2_123">The whole house was awake, the neighborhood was awake. People rushed here and there; they</div>
<div id="t10_123" class="t s2_123">looked all around inside the house. You can imagine the situation of the son! He thought, ”This is</div>
<div id="t11_123" class="t s2_123">the end. Finished! My father is mad! I should not have asked – this is not for me. He was right to</div>
<div id="t12_123" class="t s2_123">say that thieves are born not made. But is this a way to teach? If I stay alive I will kill this old man! I</div>
<div id="t13_123" class="t s2_123">will go home and cut his head off immediately!”</div>
<div id="t14_123" class="t s2_123">Tao: The Golden Gate, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t15_123" class="t s2_123">123</div>
<div id="t16_123" class="t s3_123">Osho</div>
