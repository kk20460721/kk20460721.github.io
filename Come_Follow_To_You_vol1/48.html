<div id="t4_48" class="t s1_48">He went to the wise man. Before he had even asked, the wise man said, "Yes, I </div>

<div id="t6_48" class="t s1_48">to go to. "Go to that peak and sit on that peak for three days. In those three days </div>
<div id="t7_48" class="t s1_48">you will see something which you have never seen before. Then come back." </div>
<div id="t8_48" class="t s1_48">The man rushed away. He had the fastest horse in the country and he rushed to </div>

<div id="td_48" class="t s1_48">going to be handed to him. He waited and waited; he fantasized, he dreamed. He </div>
<div id="te_48" class="t s1_48">could not even see the beautiful valley that was around or the beautiful, silent </div>
<div id="tf_48" class="t s1_48">river that passed by, not making even a slight noise. He could not hear the birds </div>
<div id="tg_48" class="t s1_48">singing in the morning, he could not see the beautiful sunset. He could see </div>
<div id="th_48" class="t s1_48">nothing because he was so full of dreams and so tense, waiting for something. </div>
<div id="ti_48" class="t s1_48">Three days passed and nothing happened. He was very annoyed and angry. He </div>
<div id="tj_48" class="t s1_48">rushed back to the wise man and he said, "Nothing happened. I could not see </div>
