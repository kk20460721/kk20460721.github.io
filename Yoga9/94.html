<div id="tc_94" class="t s1_94">runs according to the clock, even sometimes to ridiculous states. </div>
<div id="td_94" class="t s1_94">I will tell you one anecdote. </div>

<div id="tu_94" class="t s1_94">Once the chronological time is taken too seriously, then one forgets everything else. The </div>
<div id="tv_94" class="t s1_94">whole West is obsessed with time too much. Everything has to be done on time. </div>

<div id="tz_94" class="t s1_94">time for lunch, unless you are feeling hungry? When you say "lunchtime," it means </div>
