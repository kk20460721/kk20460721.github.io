<div id="t3_182" class="t s1_182">Just the other day, in his sutra, Buddha was talking about a good charioteer. And he </div>

<div id="t5_182" class="t s1_182">wherever it wants to, the horses go on moving wherever they want to. You are simply </div>

<div id="te_182" class="t s1_182">how to put it off; it is always on. </div>
<div id="tf_182" class="t s1_182">It is like a radio in your room which is always on and you don't know how to turn it off, </div>

<div id="ti_182" class="t s1_182">don't know how to turn it off. The whole day you are tired, many times you want to get </div>

<div id="to_182" class="t s1_182">The villager was very much puzzled by only one thing -- the electricity, the electric </div>

<div id="tq_182" class="t s1_182">this electric bulb? </div>
<div id="tr_182" class="t s1_182">He tried all that he knew: standing on a chair he blew it many times, but nothing would </div>
<div id="ts_182" class="t s1_182">happen to it. He watched it from everywhere; there was no hole, there was nothing. </div>
<div id="tt_182" class="t s1_182">And how could he imagine that just on the wall there is a switch? That was impossible </div>
<div id="tu_182" class="t s1_182">for him to imagine, he had never seen electricity. But he was also afraid to go and ask </div>

<div id="t11_182" class="t s1_182">wouldn't come because of the light -- too much light, too bright light, he had never seen </div>
<div id="t12_182" class="t s1_182">such bright light. One candle he has known, and the bulb must have been of a hundred </div>
<div id="t13_182" class="t s1_182">candles or more. In the morning he was dead tired. </div>
<div id="t14_182" class="t s1_182">Freud asked him, "You look very tired. Couldn't you sleep?" </div>
