<div id="t2_331" class="t s2_331">wait for the right moment – when he would become ready, then the master would do something.</div>
<div id="t3_331" class="t s2_331">Just by waiting for six years, you will fall into meditation. What can you do? He might have thought</div>
<div id="t4_331" class="t s2_331">for a few days about old things, but if you do not give new food every day to the mind, by and by it</div>
<div id="t5_331" class="t s2_331">stops. How long can you chew again and again on the same thing?</div>
<div id="t6_331" class="t s2_331">He might have been thinking about past things, and by and by, because no new stimulus was given,</div>
<div id="t7_331" class="t s2_331">thinking stopped. He was not allowed to read, he was not allowed to talk, he was not allowed to move</div>
<div id="t8_331" class="t s2_331">and meet anyone. He was just allowed to fulﬁll the basic bodily needs and wait on the verandah.</div>
<div id="t9_331" class="t s2_331">Silently he waited, day after day – day in, day out, day and night. Summer would come and pass</div>
<div id="ta_331" class="t s2_331">away, and winter would come and pass away, and there would be rain and it would pass away: he</div>
<div id="tb_331" class="t s2_331">must have forgotten time. He must have forgotten for how many days he had been there. And then</div>
<div id="tc_331" class="t s2_331">one day suddenly the master appeared, and he looked deeply into his eyes. Lin Chi’s eyes must</div>
<div id="td_331" class="t s2_331">have suddenly become static, non-dynamic. This was the moment; six years were wasted for this.</div>
<div id="te_331" class="t s2_331">There was no movement of the eyes, because a single movement and he may miss. Everything</div>
<div id="tf_331" class="t s2_331">must have become silent – and then suddenly, the uproarious laughter: the master began laughing</div>
<div id="tg_331" class="t s2_331">madly. That laughter must have been heard deep down at the very core; it must have reached.</div>
<div id="th_331" class="t s2_331">So when Lin Chi was asked, ”What happened to you?” he said, ”When my master laughed, suddenly</div>
<div id="ti_331" class="t s2_331">I recognized that the whole world is just a joke. In his laughter, this was the message: The whole</div>
<div id="tj_331" class="t s2_331">world is just a joke, just a drama. An seriousness disappeared. And if the whole world is just a joke,</div>
<div id="tk_331" class="t s2_331">who is in bondage? And who needs to be free?” So Lin Chi said, ”There was no bondage at all. I</div>
<div id="tl_331" class="t s2_331">was thinking that I was bound, and that is why I was trying to be free, and then suddenly the master</div>
<div id="tm_331" class="t s2_331">laughed and the bondage fell away.”</div>
<div id="tn_331" class="t s2_331">Sometimes it has happened with such things; you can never conceive of how it was possible. There</div>
<div id="to_331" class="t s2_331">are many Zen stories... One Zen master became aware when the gong was beaten. Just while he</div>
<div id="tp_331" class="t s2_331">was hearing the gong being beaten, the sound, something shattered in him. One Zen nun became</div>
<div id="tq_331" class="t s2_331">aware, enlightened, while she was carrying two pails of water. Suddenly the bamboo broke, and the</div>
<div id="tr_331" class="t s2_331">earthen pots fell down. The sound, the breaking of the pots and the water ﬂowing out of them, and</div>
<div id="ts_331" class="t s2_331">she became enlightened.</div>
<div id="tt_331" class="t s2_331">What happened? You can break many pots, but nothing will happen. A right moment had come.</div>
<div id="tu_331" class="t s2_331">She was coming back. Her master had said, ”This night I am going to give you the secret, so go</div>
<div id="tv_331" class="t s2_331">and take a bath, and bring two pails of water for me. I will take a bath and impart to you the secret</div>
<div id="tw_331" class="t s2_331">for which you have been waiting.” She must have felt ecstatic – the moment had come. She took a</div>
<div id="tx_331" class="t s2_331">bath, ﬁlled the pots, and carried them back.</div>
<div id="ty_331" class="t s2_331">It was a full-moon night, and just when she was passing on the footpath from the river to the ashram,</div>
<div id="tz_331" class="t s2_331">suddenly the bamboo broke. When she reached, the master was waiting, and he looked at her and</div>
<div id="t10_331" class="t s2_331">he said, ”Now there is no need, it has happened. Now I have nothing to convey. You have already</div>
<div id="t11_331" class="t s2_331">received.”</div>
<div id="t12_331" class="t s2_331">That old nun used to say, ”With that bamboo breaking, something broke in me – something broke in</div>
<div id="t13_331" class="t s2_331">me also. Those pails falling down, those broken earthen pots, and I saw my body broken. I looked</div>
<div id="t14_331" class="t s2_331">at the moon. Everything was silent, serene, and I became silent and serene. From that moment, I</div>
<div id="t15_331" class="t s2_331">have not been, I am no more.” This is what liberation, freedom means.</div>
