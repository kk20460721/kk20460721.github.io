<div id="t3_57" class="t s1_57">When Bodhidharma says that these people go on falling into darkness, he is </div>
<div id="t4_57" class="t s1_57">saying that they go on becoming more and more deluded. They have to make the </div>

<div id="ts_57" class="t s1_57">He said, "I know it also, but the whole neighborhood does not know about it. I </div>
