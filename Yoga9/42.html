<div id="t1_42" class="t s1_42">understood because in Sanskrit we have three words for the ego and in English there is </div>
<div id="t2_42" class="t s1_42">only one word. That creates difficulty. The Sanskrit word in the sutra is asmita, so let me </div>
<div id="t3_42" class="t s1_42">first explain it to you. </div>
<div id="t4_42" class="t s1_42">There are three words: ahankar asmita atma. All mean "I." Ahankar can be translated as </div>
<div id="t5_42" class="t s1_42">the "ego," the very gross, too much emphasis on I. For asmita there is no word in English. </div>
<div id="t6_42" class="t s1_42">Asmita means amness. I am; in ego the emphasis is on "I"; in asmita the emphasis is on </div>
<div id="t7_42" class="t s1_42">"am." Amness, purer than ego. Still it is there, but in a very different form. Amness. And </div>
<div id="t8_42" class="t s1_42">atma; even amness has disappeared. In the ego "I am"; in asmita only "am"; in atma even </div>
<div id="t9_42" class="t s1_42">that has disappeared. In atma there is pure being, neither I nor amness. </div>
<div id="ta_42" class="t s1_42">In this sutra asmita is used, amness. Remember, the ego is of the mind. Senses have no </div>
<div id="tb_42" class="t s1_42">ego. They have a certain amness but no ego. The ego is of the mind. Your eyes don't have </div>
<div id="tc_42" class="t s1_42">any ego; your hands don't have any ego. They have a certain amness. That's why if your </div>
<div id="td_42" class="t s1_42">skin has to be replaced and somebody else's skin is planted on you, your body will reject </div>
<div id="te_42" class="t s1_42">it, because the body knows "it is not mine." So your own skin has to be replaced from </div>
<div id="tf_42" class="t s1_42">some other part of the body, from your thighs. Your own skin has to be replaced; </div>
<div id="tg_42" class="t s1_42">otherwise the body will reject. The body will not accept it: "It is not mine." The body has </div>
<div id="th_42" class="t s1_42">no I but it has an amness. </div>
<div id="ti_42" class="t s1_42">If you need blood, anybody's blood won't do. The body will not accept all sorts of blood, </div>
<div id="tj_42" class="t s1_42">only a particular blood. It has its own amness. That will be accepted; some other blood </div>
<div id="tk_42" class="t s1_42">will be rejected. The body has its own feel of its being. Very unconscious, very subtle </div>
<div id="tl_42" class="t s1_42">and pure, but it is there. </div>
<div id="tm_42" class="t s1_42">Yom eyes are yours, just like your thumbprints. Everything yours is yours. Now </div>
<div id="tn_42" class="t s1_42">physiologists say that everybody's heart is different, of a different shape. In the books of </div>
<div id="to_42" class="t s1_42">physiology the picture that you will find is not a real picture. It is just average; it is just </div>
<div id="tp_42" class="t s1_42">imagined. Otherwise each person's heart has a different shape. Even each person's kidney </div>
<div id="tq_42" class="t s1_42">has a different shape. These parts all have their signatures; everybody is so unique. That </div>
<div id="tr_42" class="t s1_42">is the amness. </div>
<div id="ts_42" class="t s1_42">You will never be here again, you have never been before, so move cautiously and alertly </div>
<div id="tt_42" class="t s1_42">and happily. Just think, the glory of your being. Just think, that you are so superb and </div>
<div id="tu_42" class="t s1_42">unique. God has vested much in you. Never imitate, because that will be a betrayal. Be </div>
<div id="tv_42" class="t s1_42">yourself. Let that be your religion. All else is politics. Don't be a Hindu, don't be a </div>
<div id="tw_42" class="t s1_42">Mohammedan, don't be a Christian. Be religious, but there is only one religion, and that </div>
<div id="tx_42" class="t s1_42">is just being yourself, authentically yourself. </div>
<div id="ty_42" class="t s1_42">"Performing samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, asmita (the subtle </div>
<div id="tz_42" class="t s1_42">amness), all-pervasiveness, and functions brings mastery over the sense organs." And if </div>
<div id="t10_42" class="t s1_42">you meditate on these things, you will become a master. Meditation brings mastery; </div>
<div id="t11_42" class="t s1_42">nothing else brings mastery except meditation. If you meditate on your eye, first you will </div>
<div id="t12_42" class="t s1_42">see the rose flower; by and by you will be able to see the eye that is seeing. Then you </div>
<div id="t13_42" class="t s1_42">have become a master of the eye. Once you have seen the seeing eye, you have become a </div>
<div id="t14_42" class="t s1_42">master. Now you can use all its energies; and they are all-pervasive. Your eyes are not as </div>
<div id="t15_42" class="t s1_42">limited as you think them to be. They can see many more things which you have not </div>
<div id="t16_42" class="t s1_42">seen. They can penetrate many more mysteries that you have not even dreamed about. </div>
<div id="t17_42" class="t s1_42">But you are not master of your eyes, and you have used them in a very haphazard way, </div>
<div id="t18_42" class="t s1_42">not knowing what you are doing. </div>
<div id="t19_42" class="t s1_42">And having been in contact with objects too much, you have forgotten the subjectivity of </div>
<div id="t1a_42" class="t s1_42">your eyes. It happens if you keep company with someone, by and by you become </div>
