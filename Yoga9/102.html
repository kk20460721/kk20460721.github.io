<div id="t3_102" class="t s1_102">Freud reduces everything to sex. Whatsoever you dream makes no difference. He will </div>
<div id="t4_102" class="t s1_102">find a way and reduce it to sex. It seems he was obsessed with sex. He was a great </div>
<div id="t5_102" class="t s1_102">pioneer, he has opened a great door, but he was phobic and he was afraid of sex; and he </div>
<div id="t6_102" class="t s1_102">was afraid of other things also. He was so phobic that he could not cross the road; that </div>

<div id="td_102" class="t s1_102">That's natural, that's how it should be. </div>
<div id="te_102" class="t s1_102">Jung brings everything to religion, everything. Whatsoever you dream he will interpret in </div>
<div id="tf_102" class="t s1_102">such a way that it becomes a religious dream. The same dream becomes sexual with </div>

<div id="ti_102" class="t s1_102">to gain more power -- "will to power." And now there are a thousand and one </div>
<div id="tj_102" class="t s1_102">psychoanalysts all over the world, of different denominations. The denominations are as </div>
<div id="tk_102" class="t s1_102">many as in Christianity. So many schools, and every psychoanalyst starts his own school. </div>

<div id="tx_102" class="t s1_102">been aware, but we created a totally different type of person to help. We call that person </div>

<div id="t12_102" class="t s1_102">complexes, nothing -- you are completely clean of the mind, the mind has disappeared </div>
<div id="t13_102" class="t s1_102">and you have attained to no-mind -- then, then you can see. Then you will not interpret in </div>
<div id="t14_102" class="t s1_102">a personal way. Your interpretation will be universal, will become existential. </div>
<div id="t15_102" class="t s1_102">And the third is real time, existential. The real time is no time at all, because the real time </div>
<div id="t16_102" class="t s1_102">is eternity. Let me explain it to you. </div>
<div id="t17_102" class="t s1_102">The chronological time is arbitrary. In the West Zeno proved it long before. In the East </div>
