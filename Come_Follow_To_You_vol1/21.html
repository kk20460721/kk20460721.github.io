<div id="t1_21" class="t s1_21">Ramakrishna functioned more freely than Jesus because there was no pattern for </div>
<div id="t2_21" class="t s1_21">him. He lived more spontaneously than Jesus. There was no confinement </div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">anywhere; all the directions were open to him. He could fly just like a bird in the </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">sky, no limitations existed. But then comes the disciple. He organizes it. He </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">organizes, of course, in his own way. </div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">Both ways have their benefits, both have their defects. Then there is a third </div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s1_21">possibility which has never been used before. Krishnamurti is the first in the </div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s1_21">world to have used the third possibility. The third possibility is to deny both: the </div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">predecessors and the successors both. It is negative. </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">Krishnamurti's method is VIA NEGATIVA. So first he denied those who </div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s1_21">prepared the ground for him, That was the only way to get out of the limitations. </div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s1_21">He denied the whole Theosophical Movement: Annie Besant, Leadbetter -- they </div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">were the people who prepared the whole ground and they worked hard for </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">Krishnamurti. They were the John the Baptists for him. They created a vast </div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">opportunity in the world for him, but then he looked, when he was ready, and he </div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s1_21">saw the defects and the limitations: that the same would be the case as happened </div>
<div id="th_21" class="t s1_21">with Jesus. He simply denied. He denied that they created a ground or that there </div>
<div id="ti_21" class="t s1_21">was any need to create the ground. </div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">While denying them he was aware that he had to deny his messiahship also -- </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">because if he said that he is the messiah then he could deny the predecessors, but </div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s1_21">the successors would follow. Then the same trouble would be there as it had </div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s1_21">been with Ramakrishna. So he denied: "There is nobody who has preceded me </div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s1_21">and there is nobody who is going to succeed me." He denied Leadbetter, Annie </div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s1_21">Besant and the Theosophical Movement, and for his whole life he has been </div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s1_21">denying that anybody is going to become his heir or successor. </div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">This has its own beauty, but its problems also. You may be free, very free, </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">absolutely free -- because there is no limitation on either side, before or after -- </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">but your freedom is in negativity. You don't create. Your freedom comes to no </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">fulfillment, it is futile -- you don't help. It is as if somebody is so conscious about </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">not falling ill -- he continuously works and remains aware not to fall ill -- that he </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">forgets that sometimes you have to enjoy the health also. Otherwise you may not </div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">fall ill but the very awareness that "one should not fall ill and must remain </div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s1_21">aware" becomes an illness of a sort. </div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">Krishnamurti is so much alert about it -- that no bondage should be created </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">anywhere, no fetters should be created anywhere -- that he worked hard, but </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">couldn't help anybody. It was beautiful for himself, but it has not been beneficial </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">for humanity. He is a free man, but his freedom is his alone. That freedom could </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">not become a taste in thousands and thousands of throats; it could not create an </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">urge. He has remained a pinnacle of freedom, but no bridge exists. You can look </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">at him -- he is like a beautiful painting or beautiful poetry -- but nothing can be </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">done about it, it doesn't change you. He has broken all the bridges. This is the </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">third possibility -- never tried before. He is the first to try it. </div>
