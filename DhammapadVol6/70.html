<div id="t4_70" class="t s1_70">world, but you cannot leave your mind here. The mind will go with you; it is inside </div>
<div id="t5_70" class="t s1_70">you. And wherever you are, your same mind will create the same kind of world around </div>
<div id="t6_70" class="t s1_70">you. </div>
<div id="t7_70" class="t s1_70">A great mystic was dying. He called his disciple, the chief disciple. The disciple rejoiced </div>
<div id="t8_70" class="t s1_70">very much that the master is calling him. There is a great crowd and he is calling only </div>
<div id="t9_70" class="t s1_70">him; he must be giving some secret key that he has not given to anybody up to now. </div>
<div id="ta_70" class="t s1_70">"This is the way he is choosing me as his successor!" He came close. </div>
<div id="tb_70" class="t s1_70">The master said, "I have only one thing to tell you. I didn't listen to my master -- he had </div>
<div id="tc_70" class="t s1_70">also told me when he was dying, but I was just a fool and I didn't listen, and I didn't </div>
<div id="td_70" class="t s1_70">even understand what he meant. But I am telling you from my own experience he is </div>
<div id="te_70" class="t s1_70">right, although it had looked very absurd when he said it to me." </div>
<div id="tf_70" class="t s1_70">The disciple asked, "What is it? Please tell me. I will try to follow it word by word." </div>
<div id="tg_70" class="t s1_70">The master said, "It is a very simple thing: never, never in your life keep a cat in your </div>
<div id="th_70" class="t s1_70">house!" And before the disciple could have asked why, the master died! </div>
<div id="ti_70" class="t s1_70">Now he was at a loss -- what a stupid kind of thing! And now whom to ask? He </div>
<div id="tj_70" class="t s1_70">inquired of some old people in the village, "Is there any clue to this message? There </div>
<div id="tk_70" class="t s1_70">must be something mysterious in this!" </div>
<div id="tl_70" class="t s1_70">One old man said, "Yes, I know, because his master -- your master's master -- had also </div>
<div id="tm_70" class="t s1_70">told him, 'Never, never keep a cat in your house!' but he didn't listen. I know the whole </div>

<div id="tq_70" class="t s1_70">The old man laughed. He said, "It is a simple thing, it is not absurd. Your master's </div>
<div id="tr_70" class="t s1_70">master had given him a great message, but he never inquired, 'What is the meaning of </div>
<div id="ts_70" class="t s1_70">it?' You are at least intelligent enough to inquire about it. He simply forgot about it. </div>
<div id="tt_70" class="t s1_70">Your master was young when the message was given; he used to live in the forest. He </div>
<div id="tu_70" class="t s1_70">had only just two clothes with him; that was all that he possessed. But there were big </div>
<div id="tv_70" class="t s1_70">rats in the house and they would destroy his clothes, and again and again he would </div>

<div id="tz_70" class="t s1_70">on supplying you new clothes every month?' </div>

<div id="t13_70" class="t s1_70">the cat was always there, crying, weeping, going round and round and round him. </div>
<div id="t14_70" class="t s1_70">"He went to the villagers and they said, 'This is a difficult thing -- now we will have to </div>
