<div id="t1_21" class="t s1_21">between you and God. You need more meditators, people who go deeper into their </div>
<div id="t2_21" class="t s1_21">being, people who become centered, people who know the inner silence, the virgin </div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">silence and the tremendous beauty of it. They will help humanity, and they will not </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">help humanity directly either. Their very presence will radiate new vibes which can </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">transform. </div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">A real person always helps people indirectly. He is not aggressive. He does not </div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s1_21">command you, "Do this, don't do that." He does not destroy your freedom in any way. </div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s1_21">He simply lives his life in the light that he has found within himself. And being with </div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">him, something transpires between you and him. </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">A real master is never a priest. And I have never heard about a priest who was a real </div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s1_21">master. If you are a master you cease to be a priest, and if you are a priest it is </div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s1_21">impossible for you to be a master. The priest belongs to a certain ideology -- Hindu, </div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">Christian, Mohammedan. The master belongs to no ideology. He is more conscious, not </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">more knowledgeable. He has more being, not more knowledge. He has more soul, not a </div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">bigger memory. He may not know the scriptures -- because he himself IS the scripture! </div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s1_21">And you will not find him in the temples and the mosques and the churches. </div>
<div id="th_21" class="t s1_21">I have heard about a very religious Negro who wanted to go to the church, but there </div>
<div id="ti_21" class="t s1_21">was only one church in his neighborhood and that belonged to white people. </div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">The priest was a kindly man -- as priests are supposed to be. When the Negro knocked </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">on the door one day, the priest came out. The priest was in an embarrassing situation -- </div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s1_21">whether to say yes to him or no. To say yes was dangerous because the whole </div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s1_21">congregation will be against it. It was the white people's church and no black person </div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s1_21">had been allowed; that was a tacit agreement. But how to say no to this simple man </div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s1_21">whose eyes were full of tears and who said, "I want to come in and I want to pray to </div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s1_21">Jesus Christ"? </div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">But priests are cunning people. Howsoever kind they may appear on the surface, deep </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">down they are cunning. If they are not cunning they will not be in the profession of the </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">priests at all, because that profession is far worse than any other profession. Even </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">prostitutes are better than priests! At least they sell only their bodies, and priests are </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">selling even their souls. </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">The priest immediately invented some strategy. He said, "Good, you can come, but not </div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">right now. First purify yourself, only then your prayer will be heard." </div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s1_21">That was a tricky strategy. No white man was ever asked to purify himself first, and </div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">then enter into the church. And who is going to decide when the man is pure enough? </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">That will be up to the priest and he can always go on saying, "You are not pure enough </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">yet." </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">The Negro went back. He was really in a deep love affair with God; he cried and wept, </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">and he tried in every possible way not to do anything wrong, to avoid anything that </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">may make him impure. For three weeks he remained in isolation, fasting, praying. And </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">after three weeks God appeared to him: his desire was fulfilled. </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">After that experience he went to the church. The priest was very much afraid -- this man </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">was coming again, and he had such a beautiful aura around him that the priest was </div>
