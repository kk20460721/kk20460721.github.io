<div id="t2_71" class="t s1_71">full of his followers. They all got down, and the man said, "Okay, then try to take your </div>
<div id="t3_71" class="t s1_71">train. I will not allow it to move a single inch" -- and he stood there with rolled-up eyes. </div>
<div id="t4_71" class="t s1_71">And the driver tried, and the guard was showing the flag and the stationmaster was </div>
<div id="t5_71" class="t s1_71">showing the flag, and nothing was happening. The train was stuck because the driver </div>
<div id="t6_71" class="t s1_71">was bribed, the guard was bribed. Three persons were bribed. </div>
<div id="t7_71" class="t s1_71">Finally they rushed to him, fell at his feet, asked to be forgiven, asked him to come in </div>
<div id="t8_71" class="t s1_71">again and told him, "Nobody will ever again ask you for the ticket. We are stupid </div>
<div id="t9_71" class="t s1_71">people -- forgive us!" </div>
<div id="ta_71" class="t s1_71">He entered the train and immediately it moved. That created a great sensation. </div>
<div id="tb_71" class="t s1_71">Thousands of people became his followers because he managed to do this miracle. </div>
<div id="tc_71" class="t s1_71">All miracles are done in this way. If you want to do miracles, you can come in private to </div>
<div id="td_71" class="t s1_71">me and I will teach you -- because these tricks cannot be taught publicly! Once you </div>
<div id="te_71" class="t s1_71">know, everybody knows; then they lose their whole mystery. All these tricks are done </div>
<div id="tf_71" class="t s1_71">in this way. But people's expectations are fulfilled. </div>
<div id="tg_71" class="t s1_71">The pseudo masters speak the language of your desires. They say, "If you meditate, you </div>
<div id="th_71" class="t s1_71">will become rich, you will become successful." That is absolute nonsense. </div>
<div id="ti_71" class="t s1_71">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says to people, "If you meditate you will become healthy, you </div>
<div id="tj_71" class="t s1_71">will become rich, you will become successful, you will become famous. In whatsoever </div>

<div id="tm_71" class="t s1_71">Fifteen minutes in the morning, fifteen minutes in the evening..." just half an hour lost </div>
<div id="tn_71" class="t s1_71">and all success is yours. This is the most successful formula for success -- and you want </div>
<div id="to_71" class="t s1_71">to succeed. You want a thousand and one desires to be fulfilled. </div>
<div id="tp_71" class="t s1_71">Now, there are masters who say, "Whatsoever you want, you will get it through </div>
<div id="tq_71" class="t s1_71">meditation. Money will pour in. Just ask in deep meditation and it is going to happen." </div>
<div id="tr_71" class="t s1_71">This is speaking the language of your desire. The truth is just the opposite. If you ask </div>
<div id="ts_71" class="t s1_71">me, if you really meditate you will be a failure in life, an utter failure. If you are </div>
<div id="tt_71" class="t s1_71">succeeding, even that success will disappear because meditation will make you so </div>

<div id="tv_71" class="t s1_71">success? Meditation will make you so joyous that who wants to bother about the </div>
<div id="tw_71" class="t s1_71">tomorrow? Who wants to stake today for the tomorrow? </div>
<div id="tx_71" class="t s1_71">Meditation will make you inwardly rich, certainly. Inwardly you will become ecstatic, </div>
<div id="ty_71" class="t s1_71">but outwardly it can't be guaranteed that you will become rich, that you will become </div>
<div id="tz_71" class="t s1_71">successful, that you will become very healthy, that no disease will ever happen to you. </div>
<div id="t10_71" class="t s1_71">That is all sheer bullshit! </div>
