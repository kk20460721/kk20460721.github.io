<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">same rupee in a rich man's pocket because the poor man can use it; the rich man </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">cannot use it. The more money you have, the less is the value. A point comes of </div>

<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">frustrated with his riches that he left his palace in search of a wise man; because </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">he was really cursed, really in suffering. He wanted to feel a little happier. He </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">went from one wise man to another. but it was of no use. They talked much, but </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">nobody could show him. And he insisted -- he must have been a very empirical </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">man -- he insisted: "Show me happiness, then I will believe." He must have had a </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">scientific mind. He said, "You cannot befool me by talking. Show me happiness -- </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">where it is. Exactly if I see it, on]y then can I become your disciple." Now it is </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">rare to find a Master who can show you. There are teachers, thousands and </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">thousands. who can talk about happiness, and if you look at their faces you will </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">see that they are in more suffering than you. </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">This rich man reached a village, and people told him, "Yes, we have a Sufi </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">mystic. He may be of help. He is a little eccentric, so be a little aware of him. Be a </div>

<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">huge tree, deep in meditation. The rich man stopped there, got down from his </div>
<div id="tu_52" class="t s1_52">horse. And that man looked to be really in deep happiness, so silent, so calm. </div>
<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">Even everything around him was still -- the tree, the birds. It was very peaceful; </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">evening was falling. </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">The rich man fell into his feet and said, "Sir, I would like to be happy. I have </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">everything -- except happiness." </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">The Sufi opened his eye and said, "I will show you happiness. you show me your </div>

<div id="t13_52" class="t s1_52">it. He was always thinking, "If there is somebody who has happiness, he will ask; </div>
<div id="t14_52" class="t s1_52">and the price has to be paid. And there is nothing you car_ get in life without </div>
<div id="t15_52" class="t s1_52">paying for it." So he had brought them with him. Those diamonds were worth </div>
<div id="t16_52" class="t s1_52">millions of rupees. </div>
<div id="t17_52" class="t s1_52">He gave the bag and said, "Look." </div>
