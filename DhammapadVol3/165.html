<div id="t3_165" class="t s1_165">- what greater experience can there be?" </div>
<div id="t4_165" class="t s1_165">The pundit, the scholar, the knowledgeable person laughed and he said, "That is </div>
<div id="t5_165" class="t s1_165">nothing -- because God hugged me and kissed me! You kissed his feet? He kissed ME </div>
<div id="t6_165" class="t s1_165">and hugged me! Where is the halva? It belongs to me." </div>
<div id="t7_165" class="t s1_165">They looked at Nasruddin and asked, "What dream did you have?" </div>
<div id="t8_165" class="t s1_165">Nasruddin said, "I am a poor sinner, my dream was very ordinary -- very ordinary, not </div>

<div id="tb_165" class="t s1_165">So I have eaten it -- because how can I deny his order? There is no halva left now!" </div>
<div id="tc_165" class="t s1_165">Self-control gives you the subtlest ego. Self-control has more self in it than anything </div>
<div id="td_165" class="t s1_165">else. But self-mastery is a totally different phenomenon; it has no self in it. Control is </div>
<div id="te_165" class="t s1_165">cultivated, practiced; with great effort you have to manage it. It is a long struggle, then </div>
<div id="tf_165" class="t s1_165">you arrive at it. Mastery is not a cultivated thing, it is not to be practiced. Mastery is </div>
<div id="tg_165" class="t s1_165">nothing but understanding. It is not control at all. </div>
<div id="th_165" class="t s1_165">For example, you can control anger, you can repress it, you can sit on top of it. Nobody </div>

<div id="tm_165" class="t s1_165">unconscious, you forced it deep down into your unconscious and you sat upon it like a </div>

<div id="to_165" class="t s1_165">The man of control is the man of repression. He goes on repressing. Because he goes on </div>
<div id="tp_165" class="t s1_165">repressing, he goes on accumulating all that is wrong. His whole life becomes a </div>
<div id="tq_165" class="t s1_165">junkyard. Sooner or later, and it is going to be sooner than later, the volcano explodes -- </div>

<div id="t11_165" class="t s1_165">The religious man controls nothing, the religious man represses nothing. The religious </div>
<div id="t12_165" class="t s1_165">man understands, tries to understand, not to control. He becomes more meditative: he </div>
<div id="t13_165" class="t s1_165">watches his anger, his sex, his greed, his jealousy, his possessiveness. He watches all </div>
<div id="t14_165" class="t s1_165">these poisonous things that surround you. He simply watches, tries to understand what </div>

<div id="t16_165" class="t s1_165">his witnessing the anger melts as if the sun has risen and the snow has started melting. </div>
