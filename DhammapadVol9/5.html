<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">Spinster Peabody's proudest possession was Count, her exquisite cat. Unfortunately, he </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">had been missing for two days. When she opened the freezer door, Miss Peabody </div>

<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">She immediately called the priest, who said there still might be a chance to save the </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">poor animal. "Give it two tablespoons of gasoline," he told her. </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">With trembling hands, Miss Peabody opened Count's mouth and carefully spooned in </div>

<div id="tb_5" class="t s1_5">suddenly the cat opened his eyes, let out an ear-piercing screech and shot across the </div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">room at a hundred miles per hour, running over the furniture, the walls, even the </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">ceiling. Count kept this up for two minutes and then suddenly stopped dead in his </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">tracks, not moving a muscle. </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">Miss Peabody called the priest again. </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">"What do you think happened?" she asked. </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">"Simple," said the priest. "He ran out of gas." </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">The priests have all the answers. Ask them anything, any stupid thing. They can't say, </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">"We don't know," that is impossible. The priests have never said that they are ignorant; </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">their whole business depends upon their knowledgeability. </div>

<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">approach too -- and Socrates and Buddha were contemporaries; they have much in </div>

<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">comes to know about the rats he applies to you. It is so disgusting, so humiliating, so </div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">absurd, illogical! He studies the lowest to know the highest. </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">You can know nothing of the flower by studying the seed, by dissecting the seed, by </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">analyzing the seed. For thousands of years you can go on analyzing the seed; you will </div>

<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">nothing but a kind of animal, a little more complex maybe, but nothing more than that. </div>

<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">The real understanding of man is only possible not by studying the rats but by studying </div>
