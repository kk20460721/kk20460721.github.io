<div id="t1_170" class="t s1_170">CHAPTER 12. ONLY KNOWING REMAINS</div>
<div id="t2_170" class="t s2_170">Buddha, Jesus, attracted millions of people, and the reason is that they lived in the heart; otherwise</div>
<div id="t3_170" class="t s2_170">it was impossible. What Buddha demanded was impossible. Thousands of people left their homes,</div>
<div id="t4_170" class="t s2_170">became beggars with him, moved with him in all types of sufferings, austerities, and enjoyed it. This</div>
<div id="t5_170" class="t s2_170">is a miracle. And those who left their homes were rich, afﬂuent people, because India knew the</div>
<div id="t6_170" class="t s2_170">golden age in the time of Buddha. It was at its highest peak of richness. Just as America is today,</div>
<div id="t7_170" class="t s2_170">India was at that moment. At that moment the West was just wild; no civilization existed really. The</div>
<div id="t8_170" class="t s2_170">West was totally uncivilized at the time of Buddha, and India was at its golden peak.</div>
<div id="t9_170" class="t s2_170">Buddha attracted millions of people who were rich, living in comfort, and they moved and became</div>
<div id="ta_170" class="t s2_170">beggars. What ﬁlled them, what attracted them, what was the cause? Even they couldn’t explain</div>
<div id="tb_170" class="t s2_170">what the cause was. This is the cause: whenever a person of heart is there, a person who lives in</div>
<div id="tc_170" class="t s2_170">his heart, he imparts around him vibrations of sweetness. Just being in his presence, being near</div>
<div id="td_170" class="t s2_170">him, you feel a sudden joy for no visible cause. He is not giving you anything, he is not giving you</div>
<div id="te_170" class="t s2_170">any physical comfort. On the contrary, he may lead you into physical uncomfort; through him you</div>
<div id="tf_170" class="t s2_170">may have to pass through many sufferings – but you will enjoy those sufferings.</div>
<div id="tg_170" class="t s2_170">Buddha was dying, and Ananda, his disciple, was weeping.</div>
<div id="th_170" class="t s2_170">So Buddha said, ”Why are you</div>
<div id="ti_170" class="t s2_170">weeping?”</div>
<div id="tj_170" class="t s2_170">Ananda said, ”With you I can move on this earth, millions of times I can be reborn and it will not be</div>
<div id="tk_170" class="t s2_170">a suffering. I can suffer everything. Just if you are there, then this sansar, which you call dukkha,</div>
<div id="tl_170" class="t s2_170">suffering, is no more suffering – but without you even nirvana will not be blissful.”</div>
<div id="tm_170" class="t s2_170">Such a sweetness surrounded Buddha, such a sweetness surrounded Jesus, such a sweetness</div>
<div id="tn_170" class="t s2_170">surrounded Saint Francis, such a sweetness surrounds all those who have lived through the heart.</div>
<div id="to_170" class="t s2_170">Their charisma is that they live in their heart.</div>
<div id="tp_170" class="t s2_170">Jesus was not a very learned man, he was just a villager; he remained a carpenter’s son. He was</div>
<div id="tq_170" class="t s2_170">talking in people’s ways, ordinary parables. If someone gives you Jesus’ parables, his statements,</div>
<div id="tr_170" class="t s2_170">without saying that these belong to Jesus, you will throw the book, you will never read it again.</div>
<div id="ts_170" class="t s2_170">But he inﬂuenced people, impressed so much, that Christianity became the greatest religion of the</div>
<div id="tt_170" class="t s2_170">world. Half the earth belongs now to Christianity, to a carpenter’s son who was not educated, not</div>
<div id="tu_170" class="t s2_170">cultured. What is this mystery? How did it happen? He was not a man of knowledge, he was not</div>
<div id="tv_170" class="t s2_170">like Bertrand Russell. Bertrand Russell could have easily defeated him in any argument. It is not</div>
<div id="tw_170" class="t s2_170">difﬁcult to conceive of that. Jesus could be defeated easily.</div>
<div id="tx_170" class="t s2_170">It happened in India in just the last century. Ramakrishna, Vivekananda’s master, was here. He</div>
<div id="ty_170" class="t s2_170">was a man of heart, completely uneducated, not in any way proﬁcient in the scriptures. He had no</div>
<div id="tz_170" class="t s2_170">logic, no arguing force, could not convince anybody. It happened that one of the greatest scholars</div>
<div id="t10_170" class="t s2_170">ever born in India, Keshavchandra Sen, went to see Ramakrishna. He was a great scholar, very</div>
<div id="t11_170" class="t s2_170">logical, rational, argumentative, so many people followed just to see what would happen, because</div>
<div id="t12_170" class="t s2_170">everybody knew – it was decided – that Ramakrishna would be defeated immediately. Nobody could</div>
<div id="t13_170" class="t s2_170">argue with Keshavchandra.</div>
<div id="t14_170" class="t s2_170">Ramakrishna’s disciples were very scared. They also knew that this Keshavchandra was going to be</div>
<div id="t15_170" class="t s2_170">difﬁcult, and once Keshavchandra defeated Ramakrishna – and he could defeat him on any point,</div>
<div id="t16_170" class="t s2_170">there was no question about it – then that defeat would spread all over the country. So what to do?</div>
<div id="t17_170" class="t s2_170">Vedanta: Seven Steps to Samadhi</div>
<div id="t18_170" class="t s2_170">170</div>
<div id="t19_170" class="t s3_170">Osho</div>
