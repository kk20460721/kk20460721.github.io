<div id="t1_66" class="t s1_66">CHAPTER 5. TRUTH IS NOT VEILED</div>
<div id="t2_66" class="t s2_66">you. It can never become a common property. It can never become a collective truth. It will remain</div>
<div id="t3_66" class="t s2_66">individual.</div>
<div id="t4_66" class="t s2_66">But why are your eyes closed? There must be some great investment in them, in the closed eyes.</div>
<div id="t5_66" class="t s2_66">And there is. And that has to be understood. If it is just a matter of opening the eyes, then why don’t</div>
<div id="t6_66" class="t s2_66">you open them? Who is holding you back? Who is preventing you? Truth is naked, absolutely nude.</div>
<div id="t7_66" class="t s2_66">That is the nature of truth – you can call it God – and it is just in front of you, and it has always been</div>
<div id="t8_66" class="t s2_66">so. But why don’t you open your eyes? There seems to be a great investment.</div>
<div id="t9_66" class="t s2_66">It happened once: A woman was brought to me. She was a very beautiful person. Her husband</div>
<div id="ta_66" class="t s2_66">died, and they had been married for only three months. And they had loved each other tremendously,</div>
<div id="tb_66" class="t s2_66">against the whole society, the whole world. They had left everything just for their love. And suddenly</div>
<div id="tc_66" class="t s2_66">the husband died. It was too much for the woman, the poor woman. She remained with closed eyes</div>
<div id="td_66" class="t s2_66">for three days. She wouldn’t open them – because deep down she knew that if she opened her</div>
<div id="te_66" class="t s2_66">eyes... the husband is dead, the corpse is there. People tried to persuade her, they did everything,</div>
<div id="tf_66" class="t s2_66">but she would not open her eyes. And she would go on saying, ‘My husband is not dead. Who says</div>
<div id="tg_66" class="t s2_66">my husband is dead?’ They couldn’t wait any longer: the body had to be burned.</div>
<div id="th_66" class="t s2_66">The day they burned the body, the woman opened her eyes.</div>
<div id="ti_66" class="t s2_66">But by that time she had lost the</div>
<div id="tj_66" class="t s2_66">capacity to see! – a very deep investment. Eyes were perfectly okay, no physiological trouble. The</div>
<div id="tk_66" class="t s2_66">medical doctors were amazed. They said, ‘There is no problem! Everything is perfectly normal.’ But</div>
<div id="tl_66" class="t s2_66">she couldn’t see. It was as if somebody behind the eyes had stepped back; somebody who was</div>
<div id="tm_66" class="t s2_66">standing behind the eyes and looking at the world had stepped back. Now the window was there,</div>
<div id="tn_66" class="t s2_66">but nobody to look through it.</div>
<div id="to_66" class="t s2_66">For four weeks she remained psychically blind. And in her blindness she was continuously saying,</div>
<div id="tp_66" class="t s2_66">‘Who says that my husband is dead? If he is dead, then where is his corpse? If he is dead then</div>
<div id="tq_66" class="t s2_66">where is his corpse?’ Even in dreams, in the night, suddenly she would start saying, ‘Who says my</div>
<div id="tr_66" class="t s2_66">husband is dead?’ And she knows! Deep down she knows that the husband is dead, but the mind</div>
<div id="ts_66" class="t s2_66">would not like to believe it. The mind would like to live in an illusion. Even an illusion is beautiful if</div>
<div id="tt_66" class="t s2_66">the husband is alive, and the reality will not be so beautiful if the husband is dead. They had really</div>
<div id="tu_66" class="t s2_66">loved each other very deeply.</div>
<div id="tv_66" class="t s2_66">The woman was brought to me. I had known them before. When she came to me, she was behaving</div>
<div id="tw_66" class="t s2_66">as if she was completely blind. Somebody had to help her. I said to her, ‘Your husband is very much</div>
<div id="tx_66" class="t s2_66">troubled. Just this morning he has been to see me and he is suffering very much. Why don’t you</div>
<div id="ty_66" class="t s2_66">see! – and the medical experts say there is nothing wrong with your eyes.’ I talked as if the husband</div>
<div id="tz_66" class="t s2_66">was alive – now this was too much. Suddenly she broke, fell down, started rolling on the ground,</div>
<div id="t10_66" class="t s2_66">and said, ‘My husband is dead. Why do you say he has been to you this morning? He is dead!’ And</div>
<div id="t11_66" class="t s2_66">the eyes came back. Suddenly the stony feeling in the eyes disappeared – she was able to see.</div>
<div id="t12_66" class="t s2_66">What to do? What happened? Suddenly she realized a fact which she had been denying. Through</div>
<div id="t13_66" class="t s2_66">the denial a false blindness had happened. Once she accepted the fact that the husband was dead,</div>
<div id="t14_66" class="t s2_66">she screamed. I have never seen anybody scream that way. That must be what Janov calls the</div>
<div id="t15_66" class="t s2_66">primal scream. From the very guts she screamed. It was not a scream done by her. It was a scream</div>
<div id="t16_66" class="t s2_66">that possessed her whole being, every pore of it. The whole body mind went into a volcanic state.</div>
<div id="t17_66" class="t s2_66">The whole being trembled. It took almost half an hour for her to come back to normal. But the storm</div>
<div id="t18_66" class="t s2_66">had gone and she was silent, and she looked at me and she thanked me.</div>
<div id="t19_66" class="t s2_66">Until You Die</div>
<div id="t1a_66" class="t s2_66">66</div>
<div id="t1b_66" class="t s3_66">Osho</div>
