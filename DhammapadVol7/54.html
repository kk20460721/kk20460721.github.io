<div id="t1_54" class="t s1_54">SUCH, A LARGE PART OF HUMANITY REMAINS IN UTTER DARKNESS. </div>
<div id="t2_54" class="t s1_54">BELOVED MASTER, WILL THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS REMAIN AS IN THE PAST? </div>
<div id="t3_54" class="t s1_54">WILL THE SAME PHENOMENON CONTINUE AFTER YOU LEAVE? PLEASE </div>
<div id="t4_54" class="t s1_54">THROW SOME LIGHT. </div>
<div id="t5_54" class="t s1_54">Dharma Bhikkhu, the first thing to understand is: don't divide existence into good and </div>
<div id="t6_54" class="t s1_54">bad, into God and Devil, into forces of good and forces of evil. That division is a wrong </div>
<div id="t7_54" class="t s1_54">way to look at reality. Existence is one. In existence Jesus and Judas are not separate, but </div>
<div id="t8_54" class="t s1_54">players in the same drama. Can you think of Jesus without Judas? You think </div>
<div id="t9_54" class="t s1_54">Christianity was founded by Jesus alone? Then you are utterly wrong -- fifty percent by </div>
<div id="ta_54" class="t s1_54">Jesus, fifty percent by Judas. And in fact, Judas has played a more important role than </div>
<div id="tb_54" class="t s1_54">Jesus himself. </div>
<div id="tc_54" class="t s1_54">Hence I don't call Christianity "Christianity"; I call it "Crossianity," because the cross has </div>
<div id="td_54" class="t s1_54">become the symbol. And who is responsible for the cross? Judas is responsible for the </div>
<div id="te_54" class="t s1_54">cross. Without Judas, the story of Jesus will lose all its glory. Judas gives the contrast; he </div>
<div id="tf_54" class="t s1_54">is the blackboard on which Jesus becomes a silver line. He is the black cloud, and Jesus </div>
<div id="tg_54" class="t s1_54">shines forth as a lightning energy -- but without the black cloud you will not be able to </div>
<div id="th_54" class="t s1_54">see the lightning either. </div>
<div id="ti_54" class="t s1_54">Do you see stars during the day? They are there, but you can't see them. To see them </div>
<div id="tj_54" class="t s1_54">you will need the dark night -- the darker the night, the more shining are the stars. The </div>
<div id="tk_54" class="t s1_54">night is more starry because more and more stars appear as the darkness deepens. Will </div>
<div id="tl_54" class="t s1_54">you say that darkness is against the stars? It enhances them, it nourishes them. </div>
<div id="tm_54" class="t s1_54">So the first thing to remember, Dharma Bhikkhu, is that existence is not divided into </div>
<div id="tn_54" class="t s1_54">two camps. It is one game, it is one play; we are all players in it, and the enemy is as </div>
<div id="to_54" class="t s1_54">much needed as the friend. </div>
<div id="tp_54" class="t s1_54">It is not accidental that before Jesus was caught he kissed Judas and washed his feet. </div>
<div id="tq_54" class="t s1_54">Christians think this is just saintliness, holiness. My observation is: it is understanding; </div>
<div id="tr_54" class="t s1_54">it has nothing to do with saintliness or holiness. A tremendous understanding! </div>
<div id="ts_54" class="t s1_54">Jesus is saying, "Although Judas is going to betray me, he has to fulfill his role and I </div>
<div id="tt_54" class="t s1_54">have to fulfill mine -- and we are part of the same drama." This is the Eastern insight: </div>
<div id="tu_54" class="t s1_54">that the forces of light and the forces of darkness are not really separate, they only </div>
<div id="tv_54" class="t s1_54">appear so. </div>
<div id="tw_54" class="t s1_54">If Socrates was not poisoned you would have forgotten him long ago. And he was </div>
<div id="tx_54" class="t s1_54">going to die anyway, so the people who poisoned him helped his work, they really </div>
<div id="ty_54" class="t s1_54">served his cause. They made his name immortal. </div>
<div id="tz_54" class="t s1_54">There have been many Sufi mystics of the same status as al-Hillaj Mansoor, but how </div>
<div id="t10_54" class="t s1_54">many names do you remember? Do you remember even the name of the master of </div>
<div id="t11_54" class="t s1_54">Mansoor? All names have been forgotten. Mansoor has become an eternal light, for the </div>
<div id="t12_54" class="t s1_54">simple reason that he was killed, brutally killed -- yes, chopped into parts. Jesus' death </div>
<div id="t13_54" class="t s1_54">compared to Mansoor's looks very human, compassionate. Mansoor was killed part by </div>
<div id="t14_54" class="t s1_54">part. First his legs were cut off, then his hands, then his eyes were taken out, then his </div>
<div id="t15_54" class="t s1_54">tongue was cut out, then his head was cut off -- in parts, in pieces. </div>
