<div id="t1_349" class="t s1_349">CHAPTER 35. THE PURITY OF AWARENESS</div>
<div id="t2_349" class="t s2_349">it was disturbing his whole life and his whole future. He had got this idea that while he was sleeping</div>
<div id="t3_349" class="t s2_349">– he used to sleep with his mouth open – two ﬂies had entered his mouth, and they were going</div>
<div id="t4_349" class="t s2_349">around inside his body. Now they are here, now they are there, now they have moved towards the</div>
<div id="t5_349" class="t s2_349">head. The whole day the boy could not do anything else, there was no way to get rid of those two</div>
<div id="t6_349" class="t s2_349">ﬂies.</div>
<div id="t7_349" class="t s2_349">He was examined, there were no ﬂies. And even if you swallowed two ﬂies, they could not go on</div>
<div id="t8_349" class="t s2_349">moving this way. There are no superhighways like this, that the ﬂies are going to the head, and to the</div>
<div id="t9_349" class="t s2_349">feet, and to the heart, and to the stomach, and they are continuously going around and buzzing...</div>
<div id="ta_349" class="t s2_349">he could hear their buzz. And how could he remain at ease? Even in the night he could not sleep</div>
<div id="tb_349" class="t s2_349">well.</div>
<div id="tc_349" class="t s2_349">When the parents brought him to me they must have taken him to many people already. Somebody</div>
<div id="td_349" class="t s2_349">suggested that perhaps I might be of some help. I listened to the story and I said to the parents,</div>
<div id="te_349" class="t s2_349">”You are absolutely wrong, and the boy is absolutely right.”</div>
<div id="tf_349" class="t s2_349">The boy looked at me. I was the ﬁrst man to whom his parents had taken him who had given him</div>
<div id="tg_349" class="t s2_349">self-respect, dignity. Others were all telling him, ”You are crazy. There are no ﬂies.”</div>
<div id="th_349" class="t s2_349">I said, ”You are all crazy. I can see his ﬂies.”</div>
<div id="ti_349" class="t s2_349">The father and the mother both became disturbed... where had they come? Now I was going to</div>
<div id="tj_349" class="t s2_349">strengthen the idea of the boy even more. But it was too late. I said, ”You sit down. You have been</div>
<div id="tk_349" class="t s2_349">torturing him unnecessarily. First, he’s being tortured by these two ﬂies, and you are taking him all</div>
<div id="tl_349" class="t s2_349">around. You have been humiliating him.”</div>
<div id="tm_349" class="t s2_349">First, I talked to the boy’s parents, and convinced the boy that I was absolutely with him. He said,</div>
<div id="tn_349" class="t s2_349">”You are the ﬁrst man who knows something about these deeper problems.”</div>
<div id="to_349" class="t s2_349">I said, ”I absolutely agree with you. You have been tortured by these two ﬂies, so we will take them</div>
<div id="tp_349" class="t s2_349">out.”</div>
<div id="tq_349" class="t s2_349">He said, ”It will be very difﬁcult because they go on changing their place.”</div>
<div id="tr_349" class="t s2_349">I said, ”You don’t be worried.”</div>
<div id="ts_349" class="t s2_349">I took him inside the room, left the parents outside and told him to lie down. Because I was absolutely</div>
<div id="tt_349" class="t s2_349">favorable to him, he listened to me. He lay down, and I told him to close his eyes and watch those</div>
<div id="tu_349" class="t s2_349">ﬂies – where they were going – so that he would have an exact idea where they were. ”When they</div>
<div id="tv_349" class="t s2_349">are very close to your mouth, I will pull them out.”</div>
<div id="tw_349" class="t s2_349">He said, ”That seems to be logical. They have entered from the mouth.”</div>
<div id="tx_349" class="t s2_349">So I put him on the bed with his eyes closed, and I rushed all over the house to ﬁnd two ﬂies. It was</div>
<div id="ty_349" class="t s2_349">a difﬁcult job and it was just by chance... Hindu women use coconut oil for their hair – which is a</div>
<div id="tz_349" class="t s2_349">dirty habit. You can smell from far away that a Hindu woman is coming close. And I had seen dead</div>
<div id="t10_349" class="t s2_349">ﬂies many times in their bottles of coconut oil, so I rushed around looking for a coconut oil bottle.</div>
<div id="t11_349" class="t s2_349">And by chance, I found not only two, but three ﬂies.</div>
<div id="t12_349" class="t s2_349">The Rebel</div>
<div id="t13_349" class="t s2_349">349</div>
<div id="t14_349" class="t s3_349">Osho</div>
