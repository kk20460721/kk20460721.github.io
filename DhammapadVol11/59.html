<div id="t1_59" class="t s1_59">Once a Zen master was asked by a king -- because the master was a great painter -- to </div>
<div id="t2_59" class="t s1_59">paint a picture of a bamboo. </div>
<div id="t3_59" class="t s1_59">The master said, "It will take time." </div>
<div id="t4_59" class="t s1_59">"How long?" asked the king. </div>
<div id="t5_59" class="t s1_59">The master said, "That is difficult to say, but at least two or three years." </div>
<div id="t6_59" class="t s1_59">The king said, "Are you mad or something? You are one of the greatest painters. I was </div>
<div id="t7_59" class="t s1_59">thinking you could just draw it right now!" </div>
<div id="t8_59" class="t s1_59">He said, "That is not the problem, drawing a bamboo is not the problem -- but first I </div>
<div id="t9_59" class="t s1_59">have to be a bamboo; otherwise how do I know what a bamboo is? I want to know the </div>
<div id="ta_59" class="t s1_59">bamboo from the inside! So I will have to go and live in a bamboo grove. Now, one </div>
<div id="tb_59" class="t s1_59">never knows how long it will take. Unless I know the bamboo from within I cannot </div>
<div id="tc_59" class="t s1_59">paint it. That has been my practice my whole life: I paint only that which I have known </div>
<div id="td_59" class="t s1_59">from its deepest core." </div>
<div id="te_59" class="t s1_59">The king said, "Okay, I will wait." </div>
<div id="tf_59" class="t s1_59">One year passed. He sent a few people to see what was happening, whether the man </div>
<div id="tg_59" class="t s1_59">was alive or dead. They came back and said, "The man is alive, but we don't think that </div>
<div id="th_59" class="t s1_59">he is a man anymore -- he is a bamboo! He was swaying with the bamboos in the wind. </div>
<div id="ti_59" class="t s1_59">We passed by his side; he didn't take any notice. We said, 'Hello!' He didn't hear. We </div>
<div id="tj_59" class="t s1_59">wanted to talk to him. We looked at his eyes -- they were so empty that we became </div>
<div id="tk_59" class="t s1_59">frightened; either he has gone mad or something has happened. And he can do </div>
<div id="tl_59" class="t s1_59">anything, so we escaped. He may kill or, who knows? -- he may jump upon us! He is no </div>
<div id="tm_59" class="t s1_59">more the same man." </div>
<div id="tn_59" class="t s1_59">The king himself went to see, and the master was swaying in the wind, in the sun. And </div>
<div id="to_59" class="t s1_59">the king asked, "Sir, what about my painting?" He didn't answer. </div>
<div id="tp_59" class="t s1_59">After three years he appeared at the court and he said, "Now bring the canvas and the </div>
<div id="tq_59" class="t s1_59">paints. I am ready. And why were you people disturbing me again and again? If you </div>
<div id="tr_59" class="t s1_59">had not disturbed me I would have come a little earlier. These fools from your court, </div>
<div id="ts_59" class="t s1_59">they were saying things to me. They were saying, 'Hello!' Do you say hello to a </div>
<div id="tt_59" class="t s1_59">bamboo? They disturbed the whole thing. It took months for me to again settle into </div>
<div id="tu_59" class="t s1_59">being a bamboo and to forget that I am a man. And then you came and you said, 'Sir.' Is </div>
<div id="tv_59" class="t s1_59">that the way to address a bamboo? 'When are you going to paint?' Has anybody ever </div>
<div id="tw_59" class="t s1_59">heard that bamboos paint? You are a fool, you are surrounded by fools! I had told you </div>
<div id="tx_59" class="t s1_59">that I would come whenever I was ready." </div>
<div id="ty_59" class="t s1_59">The canvas was brought, the brushes and the color, and within seconds he drew the </div>
<div id="tz_59" class="t s1_59">bamboo. And it is said that the king wept for joy. He had never seen such a painting: it </div>
<div id="t10_59" class="t s1_59">was so alive! It was no ordinary painting. It was not from the outside, it was from the </div>
<div id="t11_59" class="t s1_59">bamboo -- as if a bamboo had sprouted on the canvas, not been painted. </div>
<div id="t12_59" class="t s1_59">Roderick, sit silently doing nothing, and let things happen -- whatsoever is happening. </div>
<div id="t13_59" class="t s1_59">If weeds are growing, let them grow. They have the right to grow as much as you have </div>
<div id="t14_59" class="t s1_59">the right to grow. And if you allow everything without any judgment, if you are </div>
