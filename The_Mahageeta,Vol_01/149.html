<div id="t1_149" class="t s1_149">CHAPTER 7.</div>
<div id="t2_149" class="t s2_149">But there are people who keep track of how much they have renounced. A friend came to see me.</div>
<div id="t3_149" class="t s2_149">His wife was also with him. This friend was known for his charity. His wife said, ”Perhaps you aren’t</div>
<div id="t4_149" class="t s2_149">acquainted with my husband, he is a very charitable, he has given one hundred thousand rupees in</div>
<div id="t5_149" class="t s2_149">charity.”</div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s2_149">Immediately the husband put his hand on his wife’s saying, ”Not one hundred, but one hundred and</div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s2_149">ten thousand.”</div>
<div id="t8_149" class="t s2_149">This is not charity, this is calculation. This is trade. Every cent is kept track of. If he should ever</div>
<div id="t9_149" class="t s2_149">meet god, he will grab him by the throat saying, ”I have given one hundred and ten thousand, tell</div>
<div id="ta_149" class="t s2_149">me what you are giving in exchange?” He gave it because the scriptures say if you give one here,</div>
<div id="tb_149" class="t s2_149">there you will receive millionfold. Who is going to pass up such a deal? Millionfold! Did you hear</div>
<div id="tc_149" class="t s2_149">the interest rate? Have you seen business like this? Even gamblers are not such great gamblers!</div>
<div id="td_149" class="t s2_149">Gambling you don’t get a millionfold. It is pure gambling. Give one hundred thousand in the hope</div>
<div id="te_149" class="t s2_149">that it will be returned millionfold. This is just an extension of your greed.</div>
<div id="tf_149" class="t s2_149">And calculating one hundred thousand...</div>
<div id="tg_149" class="t s2_149">the value of these rupees is not yet gone.</div>
<div id="th_149" class="t s2_149">Before the</div>
<div id="ti_149" class="t s2_149">rupees were kept in the safe, now in place of the safe, a record is kept of how much has been</div>
<div id="tj_149" class="t s2_149">renounced. But the dream is not broken.</div>
<div id="tk_149" class="t s2_149">There is a very ancient Chinese story: an emperor had only one son. That son was on his death-</div>
<div id="tl_149" class="t s2_149">bed. The physicians had given up saying we cannot do anything to save him. He will not survive. It</div>
<div id="tm_149" class="t s2_149">is not possible to save him. There was no cure for the disease. It was a matter of just one or two</div>
<div id="tn_149" class="t s2_149">days, he will die any moment. The father stayed awake all night sitting at his bedside. It was time</div>
<div id="to_149" class="t s2_149">to say good-by. Tears were ﬂowing from his eyes. Sitting and sitting, at about three in the morning</div>
<div id="tp_149" class="t s2_149">the father began to doze. While he slept he saw a dream of a great empire that he was lord over.</div>
<div id="tq_149" class="t s2_149">He had twelve sons – all very handsome, young, talented, intelligent, great ﬁghters, warriors! There</div>
<div id="tr_149" class="t s2_149">was no one comparable in the whole world. He had a vast horde of wealth. Unlimited. He was</div>
<div id="ts_149" class="t s2_149">a world ruler – his rule extending over the whole earth. He was seeing this dream when the son</div>
<div id="tt_149" class="t s2_149">breathed his last. His wife screamed and started crying. He opened his eyes. He was completely</div>
<div id="tu_149" class="t s2_149">shocked. He sat dumbfounded. Because just a moment before there was another kingdom, twelve</div>
<div id="tv_149" class="t s2_149">sons, great wealth – it was all gone. And here this son has died! He remained completely lost. His</div>
<div id="tw_149" class="t s2_149">wife worried whether his mind was damaged, because he had had great affection for his son, and</div>
<div id="tx_149" class="t s2_149">not a single tear was coming to his eyes. When the son was living he had cried over him, now the</div>
<div id="ty_149" class="t s2_149">son has died and the father is not crying? His wife shook him and said, ”Has something happened</div>
<div id="tz_149" class="t s2_149">to you? Why don’t you cry?”</div>
<div id="t10_149" class="t s2_149">He said, ” Who should I cry for? There were twelve, they died. There was a great empire, it has</div>
<div id="t11_149" class="t s2_149">gone. Should I cry for them or should I cry for this one? I am thinking who should I cry for? Just as</div>
<div id="t12_149" class="t s2_149">twelve are gone, thirteen are gone.</div>
<div id="t13_149" class="t s2_149">”Everything is ﬁnished” he said. ”That was a dream and this too is a dream. When I was seeing that</div>
<div id="t14_149" class="t s2_149">dream, I had completely forgotten this son. This kingdom... everything was forgotten. When that</div>
<div id="t15_149" class="t s2_149">dream broke I remembered you. Tonight I will sleep and again I will forget you. So it comes and</div>
<div id="t16_149" class="t s2_149">goes, now it is, now it is not: and now both dreams are gone. Now I have awakened from dreaming.</div>
<div id="t17_149" class="t s2_149">Now I won’t be roaming about in dreams. It is enough, the time has come. The fruit has ripened, it</div>
<div id="t18_149" class="t s2_149">is time for it to fall!”</div>
<div id="t19_149" class="t s2_149">The Mahageeta, Vol 1</div>
