<div id="t5_163" class="t s1_163">Diogenes was a naked mystic, had nothing, not even a begging bowl. Buddha at least </div>
<div id="t6_163" class="t s1_163">had a begging bowl with him; Diogenes was absolutely without any possessions. </div>
<div id="t7_163" class="t s1_163">He used to have a begging bowl, but one day he saw a dog drinking water and he </div>

<div id="ta_163" class="t s1_163">became very friendly with the dog. He used to tell people, "He is one of my teachers. He </div>

<div id="td_163" class="t s1_163">remain afraid that somebody may steal my begging bowl. I used at least two, three </div>

<div id="tf_163" class="t s1_163">Since I have thrown it away, I have no worry left in the world." </div>
<div id="tg_163" class="t s1_163">Alexander heard about the joy of Diogenes and he came to see him, and he was </div>

<div id="ts_163" class="t s1_163">next life? And why remain miserable meanwhile?" </div>
<div id="tt_163" class="t s1_163">Alexander said, "I cannot answer it. I understand -- you are right -- but I have my own </div>

<div id="tv_163" class="t s1_163">conquered it, I can renounce it but not before that." </div>
<div id="tw_163" class="t s1_163">Diogenes said, "You will never conquer it, because nobody can conquer the whole </div>
