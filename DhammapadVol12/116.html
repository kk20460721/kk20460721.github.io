<div id="t1_116" class="t s1_116">tense you become narrow -- the more tense, the more narrow. The passage between you </div>
<div id="t2_116" class="t s1_116">and that which is inside you becomes so narrow that nothing can pass through it, not </div>
<div id="t3_116" class="t s1_116">even a single name. </div>
<div id="t4_116" class="t s1_116">All the great scientific discoveries have been made in this very mysterious way -- in this </div>
<div id="t5_116" class="t s1_116">very UNscientific way, so to speak. </div>
<div id="t6_116" class="t s1_116">Madame Curie was working on a certain mathematical problem for three years </div>
<div id="t7_116" class="t s1_116">continuously and the more she tried, the farther and farther away the solution seemed. </div>
<div id="t8_116" class="t s1_116">She tried every possible way, but nothing was working, nothing was happening. And </div>
<div id="t9_116" class="t s1_116">there was somewhere a deep, tacit feeling that "The solution exists. I am not struggling </div>
<div id="ta_116" class="t s1_116">with something absurd." This tacit feeling continued all the time as an undercurrent; </div>
<div id="tb_116" class="t s1_116">hence she could not drop the effort either. She was getting tired -- three years wasted </div>
<div id="tc_116" class="t s1_116">for a single problem. But deep down within herself somebody was saying, "The solution </div>
<div id="td_116" class="t s1_116">IS possible. This exercise is not futile. Go on." And she went on stubbornly, she </div>
<div id="te_116" class="t s1_116">persisted. She dropped all other projects, she forced herself totally into the one problem. </div>
<div id="tf_116" class="t s1_116">But the more she tried, the more impossible it became. </div>
<div id="tg_116" class="t s1_116">One night it happened, almost as it happened to Gautama the Buddha; of course, the </div>
<div id="th_116" class="t s1_116">problems were different, but the process was the same. Buddha had struggled for six </div>
<div id="ti_116" class="t s1_116">years to attain enlightenment and he had attained nothing. Then one night he dropped </div>
<div id="tj_116" class="t s1_116">the whole effort, went to sleep, and, by the morning when the last star was setting, he </div>
<div id="tk_116" class="t s1_116">became enlightened. </div>
<div id="tl_116" class="t s1_116">That night Madame Curie dropped the idea, the whole project -- she closed the chapter. </div>
<div id="tm_116" class="t s1_116">"Enough is enough! Three years wasted is too much for one problem." There were other </div>
<div id="tn_116" class="t s1_116">problems which were waiting to be solved. It was finished in her mind, although the </div>
<div id="to_116" class="t s1_116">tacit understanding was still there just like a constant murmur. But she had followed it </div>
<div id="tp_116" class="t s1_116">long enough, it was time. One has only a limited time; three years is too much for one </div>
<div id="tq_116" class="t s1_116">problem. Deliberately she dropped the idea. As far as she was concerned she closed the </div>
<div id="tr_116" class="t s1_116">whole project. She went to sleep never to be bothered by that problem again. </div>
<div id="ts_116" class="t s1_116">And in the morning when she got up she was surprised. On a piece of paper on her </div>
<div id="tt_116" class="t s1_116">table, the solution was there, written in her own handwriting. She could not believe her </div>
<div id="tu_116" class="t s1_116">eyes. Who had done it? The servant could not have done it -- he knew nothing of </div>
<div id="tv_116" class="t s1_116">mathematics, and if Madame Curie had not been able to do it in three years, how could </div>
<div id="tw_116" class="t s1_116">the servant have done it? And there was nobody else in the house. And the servant had </div>
<div id="tx_116" class="t s1_116">not entered in the night -- the doors were locked from inside. She looked closely and the </div>
<div id="ty_116" class="t s1_116">handwriting resembled hers. </div>
<div id="tz_116" class="t s1_116">Then suddenly she remembered a dream. In the dream she had seen that she had got </div>
<div id="t10_116" class="t s1_116">up, gone to the table, written something</div>
<div id="t11_116" class="t s1_116">....</div>
<div id="t12_116" class="t s1_116">Slowly slowly, the dream became clear. </div>
<div id="t13_116" class="t s1_116">Slowly slowly, she remembered that she had done it in the night. It was not a dream, </div>
<div id="t14_116" class="t s1_116">she had actually done it. And this was the solution! For three years she had been </div>
<div id="t15_116" class="t s1_116">struggling hard and nothing was happening -- and the night she dropped the project, it </div>
<div id="t16_116" class="t s1_116">happened. What happened? She became relaxed. </div>
