<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">"Oh, pay no attention," said the tailor, "he thinks he's a light bulb." </div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">"Well, why don't you tell him he's not?" asked the startled customer. </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">"What?" replied the tailor. "And work in the dark?" </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">The moment you know you are mad you are no longer mad. That's the only criterion of </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">sanity. The moment you know you are ignorant you have become wise. </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">The Oracle at Delphi declared Socrates the most wise man on the earth. A few people </div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">rushed to Socrates and they told him, "Be pleased, rejoice: the Oracle at Delphi has </div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s1_51">declared you the wisest man in the world." </div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">Socrates said, "That is all nonsense. I know only one thing: that I know nothing." </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">The people were puzzled and confused. They went back to the temple, they told the </div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">Oracle, "You say that Socrates is the wisest man in the world, but he himself denies it. </div>
<div id="td_51" class="t s1_51">On the contrary, he says he is utterly ignorant. He says he knows only one thing: that he </div>
<div id="te_51" class="t s1_51">knows nothing." </div>
<div id="tf_51" class="t s1_51">The Oracle laughed and said, "That's why I have declared him the wisest man in the </div>
<div id="tg_51" class="t s1_51">world, the greatest wise man in the world. That's why -- precisely because he knows </div>
<div id="th_51" class="t s1_51">that he is ignorant." </div>
<div id="ti_51" class="t s1_51">Ignorant people believe they are wise. Insane people believe they are the sanest. </div>
<div id="tj_51" class="t s1_51">Yes, Prageeta, it happens; it is part of human nature that we go on looking to the </div>
<div id="tk_51" class="t s1_51">outside. We watch everybody except ourselves. Hence we know more about others than </div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s1_51">about ourselves; we know nothing about ourselves. We are not witnesses to our own </div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">functioning of the mind, we are not watchful inside. </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">You need a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn -- that's what meditation is all about. You </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">have to close your eyes and start watching. In the beginning you will find only darkness </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">and nothing else. And many people become frightened and rush out because outside </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">there is light. Yes, there is light outside but that light is not going to enlighten you, that </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">light is not going to help you at all. You need inner light, a light which has its source in </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">your very being, a light which cannot be extinguished even by death, a light which is </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">eternal. And you have it, the potential is there! You are born with it, but you are </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">keeping it behind you; you never look at it. </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">And because for centuries, for many lives, you have looked outside, it has become a </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">mechanical habit. Even when you are asleep you are looking at dreams. Dreams mean </div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s1_51">reflections of the outside. When you close your eyes you again start daydreaming or </div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s1_51">thinking; that means again you become interested in others. This has become such a </div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s1_51">chronic habit that there are not even small intervals, small windows into your own </div>
<div id="t10_51" class="t s1_51">being from where you can have a glimpse of who you are. </div>
<div id="t11_51" class="t s1_51">In the beginning it is a hard struggle, it is arduous, it is difficult -- but not impossible. If </div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s1_51">you are decisive, if you are committed to inner exploration, then sooner or later it </div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s1_51">happens. You just have to go on digging, you have to go on struggling with the </div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s1_51">darkness. Soon you will pass the darkness and you will enter into the realm of light. </div>
