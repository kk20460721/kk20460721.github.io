<div id="t2_39" class="t s1_39">doctors -- they somehow manage to live. Very rarely I had seen any patients visiting </div>
<div id="t3_39" class="t s1_39">him. Yes, a few people used to come -- they used to come to read the newspapers! In </div>
<div id="t4_39" class="t s1_39">fact, that's how I started going to his dispensary -- to read the newspapers and to have a </div>
<div id="t5_39" class="t s1_39">little chitchat, and then we became friends. He was always talking about his troubles </div>
<div id="t6_39" class="t s1_39">and he was very much worried. </div>
<div id="t7_39" class="t s1_39">And then one day I heard that he had renounced the world; he became a saint. After </div>
<div id="t8_39" class="t s1_39">three years I met him in Calcutta. He was worshipped, and people were telling me that </div>
<div id="t9_39" class="t s1_39">he had MILLIONS of rupees that he renounced. I said, "Don't be stupid -- I know this </div>
<div id="ta_39" class="t s1_39">man! He had only three hundred and sixty rupees in the bank!" Now they have become </div>
<div id="tb_39" class="t s1_39">millions! </div>
<div id="tc_39" class="t s1_39">When you renounce you can go on increasing your amount; nobody can prevent you </div>
<div id="td_39" class="t s1_39">and nobody can check on it -- no auditing is possible. You can go on spreading the </div>
<div id="te_39" class="t s1_39">rumor how much you have renounced. </div>
<div id="tf_39" class="t s1_39">When I saw him, I asked him, "Doctor</div>

<div id="th_39" class="t s1_39">" </div>
<div id="ti_39" class="t s1_39">He said, "I am no longer a doctor." </div>
<div id="tj_39" class="t s1_39">I said, "You are still the same. I know perfectly well that you had three hundred and </div>
<div id="tk_39" class="t s1_39">sixty rupees in the post office! What millions are you talking about? You should say </div>
<div id="tl_39" class="t s1_39">simply that you have renounced three hundred and sixty rupees!" </div>
<div id="tm_39" class="t s1_39">He looked at me and he said, "Don't talk so loudly. You will destroy my whole </div>
<div id="tn_39" class="t s1_39">reputation!" </div>
<div id="to_39" class="t s1_39">The reputation depends on how much he has left, so when he moves from one town to </div>
<div id="tp_39" class="t s1_39">another, the amount that he has renounced increases. It has been going on that way. </div>
<div id="tq_39" class="t s1_39">This is not something new; this has happened before, too. </div>

<div id="ts_39" class="t s1_39">chariots and so many elephants and so many horses and so many palaces. That is all </div>
<div id="tt_39" class="t s1_39">nonsense, because he was not the son of a very great emperor or anything. The </div>
<div id="tu_39" class="t s1_39">kingdom that he belonged to, Kapilvatu, was such a small place that it has almost </div>

<div id="t10_39" class="t s1_39">people who were writing the story had to go on making it look bigger and bigger. </div>
<div id="t11_39" class="t s1_39">There was great competition between the Jainas and the Buddhists because Mahavira </div>
<div id="t12_39" class="t s1_39">and Buddha were contemporaries. So you can look in the scriptures</div>

<div id="t14_39" class="t s1_39">Jainas write, "So </div>

<div id="t16_39" class="t s1_39">makes a bigger claim. Then comes another Jaina scripture which makes a bigger claim </div>
<div id="t17_39" class="t s1_39">than the Buddhist scripture -- and this went on for hundreds of years, until now it </div>
<div id="t18_39" class="t s1_39">appears as if Mahavira and Buddha were great emperors, as if they dominated the </div>
<div id="t19_39" class="t s1_39">whole of India. </div>
<div id="t1a_39" class="t s1_39">The truth is that in Buddha's time in India there were two thousand kingdoms. Two </div>
