<div id="tc_135" class="t s1_135">to you. </div>
<div id="td_135" class="t s1_135">You wanted to have a beautiful house; now you have it. Suddenly, you don't know </div>

<div id="tf_135" class="t s1_135">getting the house; now you have got it. For a moment you feel good -- not because of </div>
<div id="tg_135" class="t s1_135">the house, remember, but just because the whole tension, that mounting tension has </div>
<div id="th_135" class="t s1_135">disappeared -- the house is yours. All that strain and tension is relaxed; it is the </div>
<div id="ti_135" class="t s1_135">relaxation of that tension that gives you a little experience of pleasure. That you could </div>
<div id="tj_135" class="t s1_135">have experienced any time if you had relaxed; it has nothing to do with the house. </div>

<div id="tv_135" class="t s1_135">pleasure of a mounting excitement, tension, and then the relaxation. Your energies go </div>
<div id="tw_135" class="t s1_135">on mounting higher and higher and higher, and then you explode -- you ejaculate. And </div>
<div id="tx_135" class="t s1_135">suddenly you fall back into a certain calmness; the excitement is gone. But you don't </div>

<div id="tz_135" class="t s1_135">rushing, competing, fighting for something creates great tension. </div>

<div id="t12_135" class="t s1_135">may not be interested in sex at all. You may be a little puzzled, confused: "Why are </div>
<div id="t13_135" class="t s1_135">people so much interested in sex? What is there?" You have found a new sexuality for </div>
<div id="t14_135" class="t s1_135">yourself. Science is your wife; now you are running after science. Or you may be a </div>
