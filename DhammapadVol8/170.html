<div id="t1_170" class="t s1_170">People after seventy-five years used to take the vow of celibacy. You see the foolishness </div>
<div id="t2_170" class="t s1_170">of it! </div>
<div id="t3_170" class="t s1_170">A man used to come to Ramakrishna each religious festival and he would give a big </div>
<div id="t4_170" class="t s1_170">feast. He was a nonvegetarian, and many animals would be cut up for the feast. He was </div>
<div id="t5_170" class="t s1_170">very rich. Then suddenly all those feasts stopped. There was one great festival and the </div>
<div id="t6_170" class="t s1_170">feast was not happening, and the man had come to see Ramakrishna. </div>
<div id="t7_170" class="t s1_170">Ramakrishna asked, "What happened? Why are you not celebrating this feast? Have </div>
<div id="t8_170" class="t s1_170">you become irreligious or something? Are you no more interested in your religion?" </div>
<div id="t9_170" class="t s1_170">He said, "That is not the point. My teeth have fallen out. And when I cannot eat, why </div>
<div id="ta_170" class="t s1_170">should I bother?" </div>
<div id="tb_170" class="t s1_170">The feast was not for any religious reasons; the feast was simply because he wanted to </div>
<div id="tc_170" class="t s1_170">enjoy. Religion was just an excuse. </div>
<div id="td_170" class="t s1_170">People can take the oath of celibacy after seventy-five, so they are saving both the </div>
<div id="te_170" class="t s1_170">worlds. They have enjoyed this world and now they are creating a bank balance in the </div>
<div id="tf_170" class="t s1_170">other. They are becoming virtuous so cheaply that it is all false. </div>
<div id="tg_170" class="t s1_170">Buddha introduced the idea that young people should become sannyasins. Then it is </div>
<div id="th_170" class="t s1_170">something significant. When a young person goes beyond sex, when a young person </div>
<div id="ti_170" class="t s1_170">goes beyond desires, when a young person goes beyond greed, ambition, the longing to </div>
<div id="tj_170" class="t s1_170">be powerful, the ambition to be famous, then it is something tremendously meaningful, </div>
<div id="tk_170" class="t s1_170">significant. </div>
<div id="tl_170" class="t s1_170">Remember one thing: when you are young you have energies. Those energies can take </div>
<div id="tm_170" class="t s1_170">you to hell and those same energies can take you to heaven. Energies are neutral; it </div>
<div id="tn_170" class="t s1_170">depends on you how you use them. </div>
<div id="to_170" class="t s1_170">So the first thing: just by becoming an old person does not mean that you have become </div>
<div id="tp_170" class="t s1_170">wise. Wisdom needs meditation not worldly experience. Worldly experience makes you </div>
<div id="tq_170" class="t s1_170">more cunning; hence it is very difficult to find an old man who is not cunning. You can </div>
<div id="tr_170" class="t s1_170">find a young man who is not cunning; you can find many children. In fact, almost all </div>
<div id="ts_170" class="t s1_170">the children are innocent, they are not cunning. They have not known anything of the </div>
<div id="tt_170" class="t s1_170">world. They have not learned tricks, strategies, politics, diplomacy. They are simply </div>
<div id="tu_170" class="t s1_170">whatsoever they are -- they are authentic. As they grow more and more, as they become </div>
<div id="tv_170" class="t s1_170">acquainted with the world and all the hypocrisy around, naturally they start becoming </div>
<div id="tw_170" class="t s1_170">part of the world. They start learning the same kind of strategies. </div>
<div id="tx_170" class="t s1_170">By the time a person becomes old he becomes very cunning -- not wise, not intelligent. </div>
<div id="ty_170" class="t s1_170">Remember: if you were stupid when you were a child you will be more stupid when </div>
<div id="tz_170" class="t s1_170">you are old. You will have a long, long-rooted stupidity in you with great foliage and </div>
<div id="t10_170" class="t s1_170">flowers and fruits. Whatsoever you have will grow with your age. If you meditate then </div>
<div id="t11_170" class="t s1_170">meditation will grow. But just by becoming old you cannot be wise. </div>
<div id="t12_170" class="t s1_170">The ex-captain's wife paid a visit to a doctor who had achieved fame in the successful </div>
<div id="t13_170" class="t s1_170">treatment of impotency. His method consisted of convincing the male patient he had </div>
<div id="t14_170" class="t s1_170">the virility of a horse. The doctor consented to treat the woman's husband. </div>
