<div id="t2_305" class="t s2_305">So the moment you breathe out, you throw out hot air. That hot air is enough to kill millions of germs</div>
<div id="t3_305" class="t s2_305">in the air. When you breathe in, you breathe in millions of germs with your breathing, which will be</div>
<div id="t4_305" class="t s2_305">killed inside you. So with each breath, what Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong did –</div>
<div id="t5_305" class="t s2_305">what all three did in their whole life seems to be nothing – you are doing in a simple breath.</div>
<div id="t6_305" class="t s2_305">Even at night they cannot remove the cloth. To talk to these people is difﬁcult, because the cloth is</div>
<div id="t7_305" class="t s2_305">covering their nose and their mouth too, because when you speak, air comes from your mouth, air</div>
<div id="t8_305" class="t s2_305">goes in from your mouth, so they can’t speak without the cover. So the direct hit is avoided. But to</div>
<div id="t9_305" class="t s2_305">talk to these people is very difﬁcult; even to understand what they are saying is very difﬁcult. They</div>
<div id="ta_305" class="t s2_305">are just mumbling inside the covered mouth, the nose cover.</div>
<div id="tb_305" class="t s2_305">And the people who believe in Terapanth, who have not become monks, are continuously feeling</div>
<div id="tc_305" class="t s2_305">guilty that they are breathing. I used to stay with a few Terapanthi friends in Bombay and this was</div>
<div id="td_305" class="t s2_305">the great burden on their soul, that they were not yet capable of renouncing the world and becoming</div>
<div id="te_305" class="t s2_305">monks – because unless you become a monk and renounce the world, you cannot avoid committing</div>
<div id="tf_305" class="t s2_305">sin. If even breathing is a sin, then you can think anything can be a sin.</div>
<div id="tg_305" class="t s2_305">One of the oldest senators in India was my friend.</div>
<div id="th_305" class="t s2_305">He was known as the father of the Indian</div>
<div id="ti_305" class="t s2_305">parliament. From 1916 up to ’78 he was a member of the parliament. Only one man in the whole</div>
<div id="tj_305" class="t s2_305">history of the world was his competitor, and that was Winston Churchill; otherwise he has defeated</div>
<div id="tk_305" class="t s2_305">everybody – just the length of time and continually being chosen. But he was a very mediocre man.</div>
<div id="tl_305" class="t s2_305">Perhaps that was the reason people were choosing him again and again.</div>
<div id="tm_305" class="t s2_305">He was not cunning;</div>
<div id="tn_305" class="t s2_305">he was not really capable of being a politician; otherwise a man who remains for more than half a</div>
<div id="to_305" class="t s2_305">century a member of the parliament would have become a prime minister, a president, naturally. But</div>
<div id="tp_305" class="t s2_305">he could not manage even to become a minister or a governor of a state. He was simple – better to</div>
<div id="tq_305" class="t s2_305">say he was a simpleton.</div>
<div id="tr_305" class="t s2_305">What brought him to me was the death of his son. His son was also a politician, and very promising.</div>
<div id="ts_305" class="t s2_305">He was already a deputy minister and in the next election he was going to become a minister. And</div>
<div id="tt_305" class="t s2_305">the father – his name was Seth Govindadas – was projecting all his ambitions on the son. He could</div>
<div id="tu_305" class="t s2_305">not become the prime minister of India, but his son was going to be. And he was very young, so</div>
<div id="tv_305" class="t s2_305">there was every possibility that by the time he was ﬁfty, sixty, he would become the prime minister.</div>
<div id="tw_305" class="t s2_305">But he suddenly died when he was only thirty-six. His death was a great shock to the old man. He</div>
<div id="tx_305" class="t s2_305">was very rich. The British government had given Seth Govindadas’ father the title of Raja, the title</div>
<div id="ty_305" class="t s2_305">of a king, although he was not a king. But he had so many riches and so much land, and he served</div>
<div id="tz_305" class="t s2_305">the British government in every possible way, so the government recognized his services and gave</div>
<div id="t10_305" class="t s2_305">him the title of Raja.</div>
<div id="t11_305" class="t s2_305">Seth Govindadas was the son of Raja Gokuldas, and his prestige was because he revolted against</div>
<div id="t12_305" class="t s2_305">the British government and became a freedom ﬁghter. That was his only quality, and the reason</div>
<div id="t13_305" class="t s2_305">why people went on choosing him for parliament. That was enough for the poor people: that he was</div>
<div id="t14_305" class="t s2_305">so rich, and that although the government respected his father so much, he had revolted against</div>
<div id="t15_305" class="t s2_305">his father, revolted against the government, and his father had disowned him. These became his</div>
<div id="t16_305" class="t s2_305">qualiﬁcations; otherwise he had no quality, intelligence, or anything. And because of him, his son</div>
<div id="t17_305" class="t s2_305">went into the same profession. The son was cunning and intelligent, well educated.</div>
<div id="t18_305" class="t s2_305">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t19_305" class="t s2_305">305</div>
<div id="t1a_305" class="t s3_305">Osho</div>
