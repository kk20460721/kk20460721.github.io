<div id="t2_101" class="t s1_101">curse and a blessing. He can choose to rise, he can choose to fall. He can choose the way </div>
<div id="t3_101" class="t s1_101">of darkness or he can choose the way of light. </div>
<div id="t4_101" class="t s1_101">No other being has the freedom to choose. Their lives are predetermined. Because they </div>
<div id="t5_101" class="t s1_101">are predetermined they cannot go astray -- that's the beauty of it. But because it is </div>
<div id="t6_101" class="t s1_101">predetermined they are mechanical -- that's what is ugly about it. </div>
<div id="t7_101" class="t s1_101">Man is not yet a being in the true sense. He is only a becoming, he is on the way. He is </div>
<div id="t8_101" class="t s1_101">searching, seeking, groping; he is not yet crystallized. That's why he does not know </div>
<div id="t9_101" class="t s1_101">who he is -- because he is not yet; how can he know who he is? Before knowing, being </div>
<div id="ta_101" class="t s1_101">has to happen. And the being is possible only if you choose rightly, consciously, with </div>
<div id="tb_101" class="t s1_101">full awareness. </div>
<div id="tc_101" class="t s1_101">Jean-Paul Sartre is right when he says that man is a project, that man creates himself by </div>
<div id="td_101" class="t s1_101">his own effort, that man is born only as an opportunity, as a possibility, not as an </div>
<div id="te_101" class="t s1_101">actuality. He has to become actual -- and there is every possibility that he may miss the </div>
<div id="tf_101" class="t s1_101">target. Millions of people miss the target; it is very rarely that a person has found his </div>
<div id="tg_101" class="t s1_101">being. When a person finds his being, he is a buddha. </div>
<div id="th_101" class="t s1_101">But the basic requirement is: choose your life with awareness. You have to choose </div>
<div id="ti_101" class="t s1_101">anyway -- whether you choose with awareness or not makes no difference, choice has to </div>
<div id="tj_101" class="t s1_101">be made. You are not free in the sense that if you don't want to choose you will be </div>

<div id="to_101" class="t s1_101">something essential to happen to you. </div>
<div id="tp_101" class="t s1_101">There are two schools of philosophers in the world. One believes that man is born as an </div>
<div id="tq_101" class="t s1_101">essence: the essentialist school. It says that man is already born ready-made. This is the </div>
<div id="tr_101" class="t s1_101">idea of all the fatalists. The other school is that of those who call themselves </div>
<div id="ts_101" class="t s1_101">existentialists. They believe that man is born not as an essence but only as an existence. </div>
<div id="tt_101" class="t s1_101">And what is the difference? The essence is predetermined; you bring it with your life, </div>
<div id="tu_101" class="t s1_101">you bring it as a blueprint. You have only to unfold it; you are already made. There is </div>
<div id="tv_101" class="t s1_101">no choice for you to make yourself, to create yourself. That is a very uncreative </div>
<div id="tw_101" class="t s1_101">standpoint; that reduces man to a machine. </div>
<div id="tx_101" class="t s1_101">The other school believes that man is born only as an existence. The essence has to be </div>
<div id="ty_101" class="t s1_101">created; it is not already there. You have to create yourself, you have to find ways and </div>
<div id="tz_101" class="t s1_101">means to become, to be. You have to become a womb to your own being, you have to </div>
<div id="t10_101" class="t s1_101">give birth to yourself. The physical birth is not the true birth; you will have to be born </div>
<div id="t11_101" class="t s1_101">again. </div>
<div id="t12_101" class="t s1_101">Jesus says to Nicodemus, "Unless you are born again, you will not enter into the </div>
<div id="t13_101" class="t s1_101">kingdom of my God." What does he mean? Is Nicodemus to die first physically? No. </div>
<div id="t14_101" class="t s1_101">Jesus means something totally different: he has to die as an ego, he has to die as a </div>
<div id="t15_101" class="t s1_101">personality. He has to die as a past. He has to die as mind. Only when you die as mind </div>
<div id="t16_101" class="t s1_101">are you born as a being. </div>
