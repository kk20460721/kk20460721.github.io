<div id="t2_66" class="t s1_66">insulted you and that wound is still there; you still hanker to take revenge. You were </div>
<div id="t3_66" class="t s1_66">rich fifty years ago, you cannot forget that yet; or you were poor and you are still </div>
<div id="t4_66" class="t s1_66">carrying that with you. </div>
<div id="t5_66" class="t s1_66">That's how you find the world full of miserly people. From where do they come? These </div>
<div id="t6_66" class="t s1_66">are poor people who have become rich, but they are still clinging to their poverty. Only </div>
<div id="t7_66" class="t s1_66">on the surface they have possessions, but deep down they are poor, very poor. They </div>
<div id="t8_66" class="t s1_66">can't leave their poverty -- they can't depart from their past. They are carrying it; it has </div>
<div id="t9_66" class="t s1_66">become a habit, it has become second nature to them. Hence the clinging to the money. </div>
<div id="ta_66" class="t s1_66">They cannot spend, they cannot use their money. </div>
<div id="tb_66" class="t s1_66">I know a person who has at least ten buildings and earns a lot of money but lives in </div>
<div id="tc_66" class="t s1_66">such a dirty house. All his buildings are beautiful, but those beautiful buildings have </div>
<div id="td_66" class="t s1_66">been rented and he lives in a dirty black hole. He has no wife, no children; he is alone. </div>
<div id="te_66" class="t s1_66">The reason I became acquainted with him, was that whenever he would pass through </div>
<div id="tf_66" class="t s1_66">the street where I used to live, at least from one furlong I would know that he was </div>
<div id="tg_66" class="t s1_66">coming, because he used a bicycle so old that it must have been used by Adam and Eve! </div>
<div id="th_66" class="t s1_66">It made so much noise that I became interested in the man. </div>
<div id="ti_66" class="t s1_66">I inquired, "Who is this man?" and they said, "He is one of the richest men of the town. </div>
<div id="tj_66" class="t s1_66">His bicycle has no brakes, but one thing is good about his bicycle: if you tell him to </div>
<div id="tk_66" class="t s1_66">purchase a new one he says no, he can leave it anywhere -- nobody ever steals it! Who </div>
<div id="tl_66" class="t s1_66">will steal it? Anybody stealing it... it will be known all over the city who has stolen it, it </div>
<div id="tm_66" class="t s1_66">makes so much noise!" </div>
<div id="tn_66" class="t s1_66">I told a common friend that I would like to meet the man, and I asked him, "Why are </div>

<div id="tp_66" class="t s1_66">enough money, more than you need, and once you are dead there is nobody else for </div>

<div id="tu_66" class="t s1_66">was very young. I have been a beggar; slowly slowly I have earned money. I gambled, I </div>
<div id="tv_66" class="t s1_66">did all kinds of things, and that poverty is still within me -- I am still an orphan. I am </div>
<div id="tw_66" class="t s1_66">not a rich man -- I am the poorest in this town." </div>
<div id="tx_66" class="t s1_66">And I could see it in his eyes. This is what happens to people. </div>
<div id="ty_66" class="t s1_66">You just watch your mind and you will see a queue of past events going back, far back, </div>
<div id="tz_66" class="t s1_66">to the age when you were three or four. And all that has become collected; it is heavy on </div>
