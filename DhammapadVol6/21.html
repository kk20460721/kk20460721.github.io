<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">this judgment. </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">So let me state it clearly. There are three possibilities: one, meditation; second, love; </div>

<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">In India, if you are writing to an older person you have to be very respectful. So how to </div>

<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">respect, you have to show love. But he is older as far as enlightenment is concerned, so </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">you cannot talk to him as if you are talking to a young man, younger than you; you </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">have to be respectful. </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">The mystic was puzzled. And if you cannot start the letter, how can you write it? So he </div>

<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">The other mystic received it. He read it, rejoiced in it. He was so happy that a disciple </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">who was sitting close by asked, "You look so happy -- can I also read the letter?" </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">The letter was passed to the disciple, then he read it and rejoiced in it. </div>
