<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">One day Siddhartha HAD to become aware, and he became aware. He was going to </div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s1_40">participate in a youth festival; he was going to inaugurate it. The prince, of course, was </div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s1_40">supposed to inaugurate the yearly youth festival. It was a beautiful evening; the youth </div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s1_40">of the kingdom had gathered to dance and sing and rejoice the whole night. The first </div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s1_40">day of the year -- a night-long celebration. And Siddhartha was going to open it. </div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s1_40">On the way he met what his father had been afraid of him ever seeing -- he came across </div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s1_40">those things. First he saw an ill man, his first experience of illness. He asked, "What has </div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s1_40">happened?" </div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s1_40">The story is very beautiful. It says the charioteer was going to lie, but a disembodied </div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s1_40">soul took possession of the charioteer, forced him to speak the truth. He had to say, in </div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s1_40">spite of himself, "This man is ill." </div>
<div id="tc_40" class="t s1_40">And Buddha immediately asked the intelligent question, "Then can I also be ill?" </div>
<div id="td_40" class="t s1_40">The charioteer was again going to lie, but the soul of a god, an enlightened soul, a </div>
<div id="te_40" class="t s1_40">disembodied soul, forced him to say, "Yes." The charioteer was puzzled that he wanted </div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s1_40">to say no, but what came out of his mouth was, "Yes, you are also going to be ill." </div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s1_40">Then they came across an old man -- and the same questioning. Then they came across a </div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s1_40">dead body being carried to the burning GHAT, and the same question...and when </div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s1_40">Buddha saw the dead body and he asked, "Am I also going to die one day?" the </div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s1_40">charioteer said, "Yes, sir. Nobody is an exception. Sorry to say so, but nobody is an </div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s1_40">exception -- even you are going to die." </div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s1_40">Buddha said, "Then turn the chariot back. Then there is no point in going to a youth </div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s1_40">festival. I have already become ill, I have already become old, I am already on the verge </div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s1_40">of death. If one day I am going to die, then what is the point of all this nonsense? -- </div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s1_40">living and waiting for death. Before it comes, I would like to know something which </div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s1_40">never dies. Now I will devote my whole life to the search for something deathless. If </div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s1_40">there is something deathless, then the only significant thing in life can be the search for </div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s1_40">it." </div>
<div id="ts_40" class="t s1_40">And while he was saying this, they saw the fourth sight -- a sannyasin, a monk, in </div>
<div id="tt_40" class="t s1_40">orange, walking very meditatively. And Buddha said, "What has happened to this </div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s1_40">man?" And the charioteer said, "Sir, this is what you are thinking to do. This man has </div>
<div id="tv_40" class="t s1_40">seen death happening and he has gone in search of the deathless." </div>
<div id="tw_40" class="t s1_40">The same night, Buddha renounced the world; he left his home in search of the </div>
<div id="tx_40" class="t s1_40">deathless, in search of truth. </div>
<div id="ty_40" class="t s1_40">Death is the most important question in life. And those who accept the challenge of </div>
<div id="tz_40" class="t s1_40">death, they are immensely rewarded. </div>
<div id="t10_40" class="t s1_40">The sutras. Buddha says: </div>
<div id="t11_40" class="t s1_40">WHO SHALL CONQUER THIS WORLD </div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s1_40">AND THE WORLD OF DEATH WITH ALL ITS GODS? </div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s1_40">WHO SHALL DISCOVER </div>
<div id="t14_40" class="t s1_40">THE SHINING WAY OF THE LAW? </div>
