<div id="t3_39" class="t s1_39">you lose contact with it -- you are forced to lose contact with it. The contact can be </div>
<div id="t4_39" class="t s1_39">regained, it can be rediscovered. Later on, when you become very knowledgeable, </div>
<div id="t5_39" class="t s1_39">encaged in a certain character, utterly blind to your own heart and nature, you start </div>
<div id="t6_39" class="t s1_39">asking such questions. </div>
<div id="t7_39" class="t s1_39">Just the other day Prem Vijen asked: </div>
<div id="t8_39" class="t s1_39">"Beloved Master, what do you mean when you say 'Go in'?" Such a simple statement -- </div>
<div id="t9_39" class="t s1_39">"Go in" -- and you ask me, "What do you mean?" Can't you understand these simple </div>
<div id="ta_39" class="t s1_39">words, 'go in'? I know you understand the words, but going in has become so difficult </div>
<div id="tb_39" class="t s1_39">because you have been taught only how to go out. You can only go out, you only know </div>
<div id="tc_39" class="t s1_39">how to go out. Your consciousness has been turned towards others; it has forgotten the </div>
<div id="td_39" class="t s1_39">way to itself. You go on knocking on others' doors, and whenever it is said to you, "Go </div>
<div id="te_39" class="t s1_39">home," you say, "What do you mean by 'going home'?" You know only others' houses, </div>
<div id="tf_39" class="t s1_39">but you don't know your own home. And you are carrying it within yourself. You have </div>
<div id="tg_39" class="t s1_39">been forced to become extroverts. One has to learn again ways of inwardness. </div>
<div id="th_39" class="t s1_39">Soren Kierkegaard has said: Religion means inwardness -- going into your own </div>

<div id="tk_39" class="t s1_39">I have heard that when Ford made his first cars they had no reverse gear. It was a later </div>
<div id="tl_39" class="t s1_39">addition. Without a reverse gear it was really a problem: whenever you wanted to come </div>
<div id="tm_39" class="t s1_39">back you had to go miles unnecessarily, you had to go round. Even if you wanted to go </div>
<div id="tn_39" class="t s1_39">a few feet back, you might have to take a journey of miles. Then Ford became aware </div>
<div id="to_39" class="t s1_39">that a reverse gear was needed. </div>
<div id="tp_39" class="t s1_39">I am teaching you here that the reverse gear is there, built in, you have just forgotten </div>
<div id="tq_39" class="t s1_39">about it. You know how to go out. Nobody asks, "What does it mean when you say 'Go </div>

<div id="ts_39" class="t s1_39">words! </div>
<div id="tt_39" class="t s1_39">Thinking is going out: nonthinking is going in. Think, and you have started moving </div>

<div id="tv_39" class="t s1_39">No-thought...and suddenly you are in. Without thought you cannot go out, without </div>
<div id="tw_39" class="t s1_39">desire you cannot go out. You need the fuel of desire and the vehicle of thought to go </div>
<div id="tx_39" class="t s1_39">out. </div>

<div id="t10_39" class="t s1_39">Going in is not really going in. It is simply stopping going out...and suddenly you find </div>
