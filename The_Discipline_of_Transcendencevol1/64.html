<div id="t1_64" class="t s1_64">I asked, 'How do you know?' </div>
<div id="t2_64" class="t s1_64">He said, 'I know because she is my wife. Look at her face -- in such agony, in </div>
<div id="t3_64" class="t s1_64">such anguish.' </div>
<div id="t4_64" class="t s1_64">Look at the faces of people -- their agony and anguish is written so clear. They </div>
<div id="t5_64" class="t s1_64">are broadcasting nothing else but their agony and their anguish. And the </div>
<div id="t6_64" class="t s1_64">problem is they are wearing a dead mask, a personality, which cannot grow with </div>
<div id="t7_64" class="t s1_64">them. Of course it is always lagging behind. It cannot grow. They are growing </div>
<div id="t8_64" class="t s1_64">continuously and it becomes a dead weight. </div>
<div id="t9_64" class="t s1_64">Remember, with the false you will be crushed. Never keep company with the </div>
<div id="ta_64" class="t s1_64">false. If you really want to grow into a blooming being, if you really want to give </div>
<div id="tb_64" class="t s1_64">freedom to your being, never keep company with the false. Be true, whatsoever </div>
<div id="tc_64" class="t s1_64">the cost. I repeat again: in the beginning it may seem that these pretensions are </div>
<div id="td_64" class="t s1_64">very good. They are not. Your mind is deceiving you. </div>
<div id="te_64" class="t s1_64">And if you try to keep company with the true, ego will disappear on its own </div>
<div id="tf_64" class="t s1_64">accord. Otherwise it goes on finding new ways, new methods to feed itself. </div>
<div id="tg_64" class="t s1_64">People have become so false that you cannot imagine. I was reading an anecdote: </div>
<div id="th_64" class="t s1_64">Sadie Perlmutter was sent to the finest, most expensive finishing school in New </div>
<div id="ti_64" class="t s1_64">York. There she learned all there was to know about etiquette. Despite the </div>
<div id="tj_64" class="t s1_64">expense, her mother was very proud of her. Then one dark night Sadie staggered </div>
<div id="tk_64" class="t s1_64">into their Park Avenue apartment with her clothes all ripped. 'I have been raped </div>
<div id="tl_64" class="t s1_64">on Central Park South,' Sadie sobbed. </div>
<div id="tm_64" class="t s1_64">'You know who did it?' </div>
<div id="tn_64" class="t s1_64">'No, I don't.' </div>
<div id="to_64" class="t s1_64">'You mean, after all the etiquette you studied you did not even ask, "With whom </div>
<div id="tp_64" class="t s1_64">am I having the pleasure?"' </div>
<div id="tq_64" class="t s1_64">People go on keeping their etiquette, their mannerisms, their falsities, their </div>
<div id="tr_64" class="t s1_64">pretensions, even in such situations where it is unimaginable. </div>
<div id="ts_64" class="t s1_64">I know one man whose house was on fire, but the first thing that he did running </div>
<div id="tt_64" class="t s1_64">out of the house was to tie his tie. The house is on fire and he could not run out </div>
<div id="tu_64" class="t s1_64">of it without his tie. The personality becomes so clinging to you and you become </div>
<div id="tv_64" class="t s1_64">so clinging to it. </div>
<div id="tw_64" class="t s1_64">I have heard about a great professor who was so polite that even when he was </div>
<div id="tx_64" class="t s1_64">angry he would be polite -- even in the expression of his anger. One day he was </div>
<div id="ty_64" class="t s1_64">so angry with a student that he was boiling hot, and he said, 'Please go to hell!'... </div>
<div id="tz_64" class="t s1_64">Please go to hell? </div>
<div id="t10_64" class="t s1_64">Just watch yourself. Personality is the father of the ego. If you drop personality </div>
<div id="t11_64" class="t s1_64">you will find the ego has died on its own accord. </div>
<div id="t12_64" class="t s1_64">I have heard: </div>
<div id="t13_64" class="t s1_64">An elderly woman visited an art gallery showing abstract paintings and asked </div>
<div id="t14_64" class="t s1_64">the attendant, 'What is that?' </div>
