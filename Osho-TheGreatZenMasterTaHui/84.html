<div id="t1_84" class="t s1_84">Ramateertha went to the Himalayas, to a small state called Tihri Garhwal. The king of that</div>
<div id="t2_84" class="t s1_84">state was very much impressed by Ramateertha, so he made him a special bungalow in the</div>
<div id="t3_84" class="t s1_84">mountains, where he was learning Sanskrit in order to be recognized.</div>
<div id="t4_84" class="t s1_84">One day it happened ... Ramateertha had a secretary, a certain Sardar Pooran Singh who</div>
<div id="t5_84" class="t s1_84">was a great writer in Punjabi, certainly a very refined writer -- his prose is almost like poetry.</div>
<div id="t6_84" class="t s1_84">He was so impressed by Ramateertha that he dropped his job, became Ramateertha's secretary</div>
<div id="t7_84" class="t s1_84">and was taking care of his body, his letters and the correspondence from all over the world ...</div>
<div id="t8_84" class="t s1_84">One day, looking out of the window, Ramateertha saw his wife coming. He had been</div>
<div id="t9_84" class="t s1_84">married, but he had renounced his poor wife and become a sannyasin. The wife was so poor</div>
<div id="ta_84" class="t s1_84">that she was doing all kinds of jobs in the village, grinding people's wheat or washing people's</div>
<div id="tb_84" class="t s1_84">clothes. She did not even have the tickets for traveling ...</div>
<div id="tc_84" class="t s1_84">When she heard that Ramateertha was in Tihri Garhwal, she had sold a few ornaments that</div>
<div id="td_84" class="t s1_84">had been given to her at the time of their marriage. She just wanted to touch the feet of</div>
<div id="te_84" class="t s1_84">Ramateertha. She had not come to complain -- she was really glad. In the East that has been</div>
<div id="tf_84" class="t s1_84">the tradition: if the husband becomes a world-renowned sannyasin ... even though the wife</div>
<div id="tg_84" class="t s1_84">was living in rotten circumstances, still she was very happy that she had a husband whose</div>
<div id="th_84" class="t s1_84">name would go down in the corridors of history.</div>
<div id="ti_84" class="t s1_84">When Ramateertha saw his wife coming, he told Sardar Pooran Singh, "Close the window</div>
<div id="tj_84" class="t s1_84">and close the door, and go out on the veranda. My wife is coming. Tell her that I am not here,</div>
<div id="tk_84" class="t s1_84">that I have gone into seclusion in the forest, and nobody knows when I am supposed to return.</div>
<div id="tl_84" class="t s1_84">Just somehow get rid of her."</div>
<div id="tm_84" class="t s1_84">Sardar Pooran Singh was a very sincere man. He said, "This is strange, because I have seen</div>
<div id="tn_84" class="t s1_84">you allowing people, both men and women, to see you. Why are you preventing your own</div>
<div id="to_84" class="t s1_84">wife, whom you have renounced? Now she is no longer any relation to you. Your preventing</div>
<div id="tp_84" class="t s1_84">her means that deep down your mind still believes that she is your wife. Why are you</div>
<div id="tq_84" class="t s1_84">discriminating between other women and her? And why are you so afraid?</div>
<div id="tr_84" class="t s1_84">"Certainly that poor woman cannot do anything to you. It must be something inside you of</div>
<div id="ts_84" class="t s1_84">which you are afraid. I am not going to close the window or the door. And I cannot lie to the</div>
<div id="tt_84" class="t s1_84">woman. You have to decide one thing: either you have to see her or I am no longer your</div>
<div id="tu_84" class="t s1_84">secretary, no longer your disciple. I am going."</div>
<div id="tv_84" class="t s1_84">Ramateertha could not afford for Pooran Singh to go. He was dependent on him for</div>
<div id="tw_84" class="t s1_84">everything. So he said, "Okay, if you insist, I will see her." And his wife came with tears of</div>
<div id="tx_84" class="t s1_84">joy and just touched the earth, not even his feet. And Pooran Singh wrote in his diary, "Even</div>
<div id="ty_84" class="t s1_84">my tears started flowing. The woman is so respectful, she does not consider him her husband</div>
<div id="tz_84" class="t s1_84">anymore. He has become so divine to her that even to touch his feet will be defiling him."</div>
<div id="t10_84" class="t s1_84">Pooran Singh touched the feet of Ramateertha's wife. He said, "To me you are more</div>
<div id="t11_84" class="t s1_84">religious and more understanding than Ramateertha." And Ramateertha felt so ashamed ... you</div>
<div id="t12_84" class="t s1_84">will not believe what he did: he immediately changed his clothes. He was wearing the orange</div>
<div id="t13_84" class="t s1_84">robe of a Hindu sannyasin. He dropped that and took clothes from Sardar Pooran Singh --</div>
<div id="t14_84" class="t s1_84">ordinary clothes, not those of a sannyasin. Sardar Pooran Singh asked, "What are you doing?"</div>
<div id="t15_84" class="t s1_84">Ramateertha said, "I am so ashamed. I am not enlightened; I am not even worthy to be</div>
<div id="t16_84" class="t s1_84">called a sannyasin. The recognition has come to me, although late, but still it is good that it</div>
<div id="t17_84" class="t s1_84">has come to me. I have been believing that I am enlightened, that I have renounced the world.</div>
<div id="t18_84" class="t s1_84">No, seeing my wife I could see all my lust, all my repressed sexuality. I am not worthy of</div>
<div id="t19_84" class="t s1_84">Chapter 6 - Innocence</div>
