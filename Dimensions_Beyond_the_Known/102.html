<div id="t1_102" class="t s1_102">CHAPTER 6.</div>
<div id="t2_102" class="t s2_102">had also got up and would be sitting. He told me that this type of friendship would not work, because</div>
<div id="t3_102" class="t s2_102">now it had become a daily problem. He said he had to go to the university, so he could at best sleep</div>
<div id="t4_102" class="t s2_102">only up to ten o’clock while I could wait for the whole day. It meant that he would have to fetch the</div>
<div id="t5_102" class="t s2_102">milk every day, and if that were the case the friendship could not continue.</div>
<div id="t6_102" class="t s2_102">I had made it my ﬁrst principle to refrain from doing anything. For the two years that I was in the</div>
<div id="t7_102" class="t s2_102">university hostel, I never cleaned or swept my room. I kept my cot right at the entrance of my room</div>
<div id="t8_102" class="t s2_102">so that from the door I could jump straight into my cot and from the cot I could jump straight out of</div>
<div id="t9_102" class="t s2_102">the room. Why should the whole room be unnecessarily crossed?, I felt. Neither did I want to enter</div>
<div id="ta_102" class="t s2_102">into the room, nor was there any question of cleaning it. There was, however, a sort of joy in this.</div>
<div id="tb_102" class="t s2_102">Things were left the same way that they had been arranged prior to my living there; no change was</div>
<div id="tc_102" class="t s2_102">made. No more was ever done than the minimum that was necessary. Because changing things</div>
<div id="td_102" class="t s2_102">around required that something be done, things were kept as they were.</div>
<div id="te_102" class="t s2_102">But due to this, some</div>
<div id="tf_102" class="t s2_102">unique experiences began to dawn, as every guna has its own unique experience. No matter how</div>
<div id="tg_102" class="t s2_102">much rubbish collected in my room, it did not disturb me at all. I had learned to live with that just as</div>
<div id="th_102" class="t s2_102">I would live in a place which is meticulously cleaned.</div>
<div id="ti_102" class="t s2_102">In the university where I was studying, new buildings were as yet not constructed. It was a newly</div>
<div id="tj_102" class="t s2_102">established university, and military barracks were used as a hostel. Because the barracks were in</div>
<div id="tk_102" class="t s2_102">a deep forest, it was common for snakes to appear. I used to watch those snakes while sleeping in</div>
<div id="tl_102" class="t s2_102">my cot. The snakes came, rested in the room and went away. Neither did they disturb me at any</div>
<div id="tm_102" class="t s2_102">time, nor did I disturb them.</div>
<div id="tn_102" class="t s2_102">If there is no feeling to do anything about a thing, many things become accepted as natural. If there</div>
<div id="to_102" class="t s2_102">is no feeling to do anything in life, the degree of discontent suddenly drops. In those days there was</div>
<div id="tp_102" class="t s2_102">no reason for any discontent, because by not doing anything I had no demands, and there was no</div>
<div id="tq_102" class="t s2_102">question of expecting any fruit or result out of doing nothing. When you do not do anything, then</div>
<div id="tr_102" class="t s2_102">whatsoever comes to you satisﬁes you. Sometime or the other, some friend, out of pity, cleaned the</div>
<div id="ts_102" class="t s2_102">room and I was ﬁlled with a feeling of gratitude.</div>
<div id="tt_102" class="t s2_102">During the eight or ten days when examinations were on, the superintendent of my hostel used</div>
<div id="tu_102" class="t s2_102">to awaken me at seven o’clock in the morning so that I would not remain sleeping while the</div>
<div id="tv_102" class="t s2_102">examinations were on. He would give me a lift in his car and drop me off at the examination hall.</div>
<div id="tw_102" class="t s2_102">Without effort, I used to earn sympathy and compassion from all, because all had understood that I</div>
<div id="tx_102" class="t s2_102">would save myself from doing whatsoever I could.</div>
<div id="ty_102" class="t s2_102">Many astonishing things were happening. I am telling you these things so that you can realize that</div>
<div id="tz_102" class="t s2_102">life is full of mysteries. My professor would come and tell me before the date of an examination what</div>
<div id="t10_102" class="t s2_102">I should read in order to answer a particular question. I had never gone to ask anyone for anything.</div>
<div id="t11_102" class="t s2_102">Even after the professor indicated the likely questions, he did not trust that I would read the portion</div>
<div id="t12_102" class="t s2_102">he suggested. Therefore, he would look at me with an inquiring gesture in order to know whether I</div>
<div id="t13_102" class="t s2_102">understood what he had said. He would add that the indicated questions would deﬁnitely be asked,</div>
<div id="t14_102" class="t s2_102">because he was the one who prepared the exams. There was no doubt; those questions would</div>
<div id="t15_102" class="t s2_102">deﬁnitely be asked.</div>
<div id="t16_102" class="t s2_102">I am trying to tell you that if you attempt to snatch and steal from the world, there will be great</div>
<div id="t17_102" class="t s2_102">Dimensions Beyond the Known</div>
<div id="t18_102" class="t s2_102">102</div>
