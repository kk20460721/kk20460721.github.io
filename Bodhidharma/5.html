<div id="t3_5" class="t s1_5">The conversion that happened in China is the only religious conversion in the </div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s1_5">whole history of mankind. Buddhism simply explained itself, and the beauty of </div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s1_5">the message was understood by the people. They were thirsty for it, they were </div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s1_5">waiting for something like it. The whole country, which was the biggest country </div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s1_5">in the world, turned to Buddhism. When Bodhidharma reached there six </div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s1_5">hundred years later, there were already thirty thousand Buddhist temples, </div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s1_5">monasteries, and two million Buddhist monks in China. And two million </div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s1_5">Buddhist monks is not a small number; it was five percent of the whole </div>

<div id="tc_5" class="t s1_5">Pragyatara, Bodhidharma's master, told him to go to China because the people </div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s1_5">who had reached there before him had made a great impact, although none of </div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s1_5">them were enlightened. They were great scholars, very disciplined people, very </div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s1_5">loving and peaceful and compassionate, but none of them were enlightened. And </div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s1_5">now China needed another Gautam Buddha. The ground was ready. </div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s1_5">Bodhidharma was the first enlightened man to reach China. The point I want to </div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s1_5">make clear is that while Gautam Buddha was afraid to initiate women into his </div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s1_5">commune, Bodhidharma was courageous enough to be initiated by a woman on </div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s1_5">the path of Gautam Buddha. There were other enlightened people, but he chose a </div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s1_5">woman for a certain purpose. And the purpose was to show that a woman can be </div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s1_5">enlightened. Not only that, her disciples can be enlightened. Bodhidharma's </div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s1_5">name stands out amongst all the Buddhist enlightened people second only to </div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s1_5">Gautam Buddha. </div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s1_5">There are many legends about the man; they all have some significance. The first </div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s1_5">legend is: When he reached China -- it took him three years -- the Chinese </div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s1_5">emperor Wu came to receive him. His fame had reached ahead of him. Emperor </div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s1_5">Wu had done great service to the philosophy of Gautam Buddha. Thousands of </div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s1_5">scholars were translating Buddhist scriptures from Pali into Chinese and the </div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s1_5">emperor was the patron of all that great work of translation. He had made </div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s1_5">thousands of temples and monasteries, and he was feeding thousands of monks. </div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s1_5">He had put his whole treasure at the service of Gautam Buddha, and naturally </div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s1_5">the Buddhist monks who had reached before Bodhidharma had been telling him </div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s1_5">that he was earning great virtue, that he will be born as a god in heaven. </div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s1_5">Naturally, his first question to Bodhidharma was, "I have made so many </div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s1_5">monasteries, I am feeding thousands of scholars, I have opened a whole </div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s1_5">university for the studies of Gautam Buddha, I have put my whole empire and </div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s1_5">its treasures in the service of Gautam Buddha. What is going to be my reward?" </div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s1_5">He was a little embarrassed seeing Bodhidharma, not thinking that the man </div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s1_5">would be like this. He looked very ferocious. He had very big eyes, but he had a </div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s1_5">very soft heart -- just a lotus flower in his heart. But his face was almost as </div>
<div id="t16_5" class="t s1_5">dangerous as you can conceive. Just the sunglasses were missing; otherwise he </div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s1_5">was a mafia guy! </div>
