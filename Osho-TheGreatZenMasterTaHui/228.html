<div id="t1_228" class="t s1_228">After twelve years, when he came back to the palace, he knew that his father would be</div>
<div id="t2_228" class="t s1_228">very angry. He was the only son, born when the father was very old, and all his father's hopes</div>
<div id="t3_228" class="t s1_228">were dependent on him. The old man was just waiting for him to be ready to take charge of</div>
<div id="t4_228" class="t s1_228">the whole kingdom -- he was tired and he wanted to retire -- and just before that Gautam</div>
<div id="t5_228" class="t s1_228">Buddha escaped from the palace.</div>
<div id="t6_228" class="t s1_228">Just one day before Gautam Buddha left, a child had been born to his wife. It is such a</div>
<div id="t7_228" class="t s1_228">human story, so beautiful: before leaving the palace, he just wanted to see at least once the</div>
<div id="t8_228" class="t s1_228">face of the child, his child, the symbol of his love with his wife. So he went into the chamber</div>
<div id="t9_228" class="t s1_228">of his wife. She was asleep, and the child was covered under a blanket. He wanted to remove</div>
<div id="ta_228" class="t s1_228">the blanket and to see the face of the child, because perhaps he will never come back again.</div>
<div id="tb_228" class="t s1_228">He was going on an unknown pilgrimage. Nothing can be known of what will happen to</div>
<div id="tc_228" class="t s1_228">his life. He is risking everything, his kingdom, his wife, his child, himself, in search of</div>
<div id="td_228" class="t s1_228">enlightenment -- something he has only heard of as a possibility, which has happened before</div>
<div id="te_228" class="t s1_228">to a few people who have looked for it.</div>
<div id="tf_228" class="t s1_228">He was as full of doubts as any one of you, but the moment of decision had come ... That</div>
<div id="tg_228" class="t s1_228">very day he had seen death, he had seen old age, he had seen sickness and he had also seen a</div>
<div id="th_228" class="t s1_228">sannyasin for the first time. It had become an ultimate question in him: "If there is death, then</div>
<div id="ti_228" class="t s1_228">just wasting time in the palace is dangerous. Before death comes I have to find something that</div>
<div id="tj_228" class="t s1_228">is beyond death."</div>
<div id="tk_228" class="t s1_228">He was determined to leave. But the human mind, human nature ... He just wanted to see</div>
<div id="tl_228" class="t s1_228">the face -- he has not even seen the face of his own child. But he was afraid that if he removes</div>
<div id="tm_228" class="t s1_228">the blanket, if Yashodhara, his wife, wakes up -- there is every possibility she will wake up --</div>
<div id="tn_228" class="t s1_228">she will ask, "What are you doing in the middle of the night in my room? -- and you seem to</div>
<div id="to_228" class="t s1_228">be ready to go somewhere."</div>
<div id="tp_228" class="t s1_228">The chariot was standing outside the gate, everything was ready; he was just about to</div>
<div id="tq_228" class="t s1_228">leave, and he had said to his charioteer, "Just wait a minute. Let me see the child's face. I may</div>
<div id="tr_228" class="t s1_228">never come back again."</div>
<div id="ts_228" class="t s1_228">But he could not look because of the fear that if Yashodhara wakes up, starts crying,</div>
<div id="tt_228" class="t s1_228">weeping, "Where are you going? What are you doing? What is this renunciation? What is this</div>
<div id="tu_228" class="t s1_228">enlightenment?" One never knows about a woman -- she may wake up the whole palace! The</div>
<div id="tv_228" class="t s1_228">old father will come, and the whole thing will be spoiled. So he simply escaped ...</div>
<div id="tw_228" class="t s1_228">After twelve years, when he was enlightened, the first thing he did was to come back to his</div>
<div id="tx_228" class="t s1_228">palace to apologize to his father, to his wife, to his son who must be now twelve years of age.</div>
<div id="ty_228" class="t s1_228">He was aware that they would be angry. The father was very angry -- he was the first one to</div>
<div id="tz_228" class="t s1_228">meet him, and for half an hour he continued abusing Buddha. But then suddenly he became</div>
<div id="t10_228" class="t s1_228">aware that he was saying so many things and his son was just standing there like a marble</div>
<div id="t11_228" class="t s1_228">statue, as if nothing was affecting him.</div>
<div id="t12_228" class="t s1_228">The father looked at him, and Gautam Buddha said, "That's what I wanted. Please dry your</div>
<div id="t13_228" class="t s1_228">tears. Look at me: I am not the same boy who left the palace. Your son died long ago. I look</div>
<div id="t14_228" class="t s1_228">similar to your son, but my whole consciousness is different. You just look."</div>
<div id="t15_228" class="t s1_228">The father said, "I am seeing it. For half an hour I have been abusing you, and that is</div>
<div id="t16_228" class="t s1_228">enough proof that you have changed. Otherwise I know how temperamental you were: you</div>
<div id="t17_228" class="t s1_228">could not stand so silently. What has happened to you?"</div>
<div id="t18_228" class="t s1_228">Chapter 18 - No guilt</div>
