<div id="t1_62" class="t s1_62">thousand and one efforts have to be made; only then will you become a soul. </div>
<div id="t2_62" class="t s1_62">Only rarely: in one million, one person becomes a soul. All others simply </div>
<div id="t3_62" class="t s1_62">vegetate, die, and disappear." </div>
<div id="t4_62" class="t s1_62">I say it is a strange theory, because it is not true. And I say it is very meaningful, </div>
<div id="t5_62" class="t s1_62">because something like this is needed -- at least in the west it is needed. </div>
<div id="t6_62" class="t s1_62">Otherwise, nobody bothers about the soul. But all the techniques that Gurdjieff </div>
<div id="t7_62" class="t s1_62">was using are basically the same techniques that we have used in the east for </div>
<div id="t8_62" class="t s1_62">discovering the soul. He simply changed the words. He called it'creating the </div>
<div id="t9_62" class="t s1_62">soul', 'integrating the soul', 'crystallizing the center'. But those techniques are the </div>
<div id="ta_62" class="t s1_62">same. </div>
<div id="tb_62" class="t s1_62">You are already integrated. Not on the periphery -- on the periphery there is </div>
<div id="tc_62" class="t s1_62">much turmoil. You are fragmented on the periphery. Move inwards, and the </div>
<div id="td_62" class="t s1_62">deeper you go, the more you will find that you are integrated. There comes a </div>
<div id="te_62" class="t s1_62">point, at the very innermost shrine of your being, where you suddenly find you </div>
<div id="tf_62" class="t s1_62">are a unity, absolute unity. So it is a question of discovering. How to discover it? </div>
<div id="tg_62" class="t s1_62">I would like to give Nisagar a technique. It is a very simple technique, but in the </div>
<div id="th_62" class="t s1_62">beginning it looks very hard. If you try, you will find it is simple. If you don't try </div>
<div id="ti_62" class="t s1_62">and only think about it, it will look very hard. The technique is: only do that </div>
<div id="tj_62" class="t s1_62">which you enjoy. If you don't enjoy, don't do it. Try it -- because enjoyment </div>
<div id="tk_62" class="t s1_62">comes only from your center. If you are doing something and you enjoy it, you </div>
<div id="tl_62" class="t s1_62">start getting reconnected with the center. If you do something which you don't </div>
<div id="tm_62" class="t s1_62">enjoy, you are disconnected from the center. Joy arises from the center, and from </div>
<div id="tn_62" class="t s1_62">nowhere else. So let it be a criterion, and be a fanatic about it. </div>
<div id="to_62" class="t s1_62">You are walking on the road; suddenly you recognize that you are not enjoying </div>
<div id="tp_62" class="t s1_62">the walk. Stop. Finished -- this is not to be done. </div>
<div id="tq_62" class="t s1_62">I used to do it in my university days, and people thought that I was crazy. </div>
<div id="tr_62" class="t s1_62">Suddenly I would stop, and then I would remain in that spot for half an hour, an </div>
<div id="ts_62" class="t s1_62">hour, unless I started enjoying walking again. My professors were so afraid that </div>
<div id="tt_62" class="t s1_62">when there were examinations they would put me in a car and take me to the </div>
<div id="tu_62" class="t s1_62">university hall. They would leave me at the door and wait there: had I reached to </div>
<div id="tv_62" class="t s1_62">my desk or not? If I was taking my bath and suddenly I realized that I was not </div>
<div id="tw_62" class="t s1_62">enjoying it, I would stop. What is the point then? If I was eating and I recognized </div>
<div id="tx_62" class="t s1_62">suddenly that I was not enjoying, then I would stop. </div>
<div id="ty_62" class="t s1_62">I had joined the mathematics class in my high school. The first day, I went in and </div>
<div id="tz_62" class="t s1_62">the teacher was just introducing the subject. In the middle I stood up and tried to </div>
<div id="t10_62" class="t s1_62">walk out. He said, "Where are you going? Without asking, I won't allow you in </div>
<div id="t11_62" class="t s1_62">again." I said, "I'm not coming back again; don't be worried. That's why I am not </div>

<div id="t13_62" class="t s1_62">enjoy, because if I cannot enjoy it I am not going to do it. It is torture, it is </div>
<div id="t14_62" class="t s1_62">violence." </div>
<div id="t15_62" class="t s1_62">And, by and by, it became a key. I suddenly recognized that whenever you are </div>
<div id="t16_62" class="t s1_62">enjoying something, you are centered. Enjoyment is just the sound of being </div>
<div id="t17_62" class="t s1_62">centered. Whenever you are not enjoying something, you are off-center. Then </div>
