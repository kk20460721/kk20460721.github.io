<div id="t1_153" class="t s1_153">I have heard about two hippies: </div>
<div id="t2_153" class="t s1_153">They were hungry and had no money, and on a Sunday morning they were just passing </div>
<div id="t3_153" class="t s1_153">by a church when an idea occurred to them. Both had long hair, beards, tattered clothes </div>
<div id="t4_153" class="t s1_153">-- they looked exactly like Jesus and his followers would have looked. </div>
<div id="t5_153" class="t s1_153">One said to the other, "We should find a cross; we should go to the cemetery and take </div>
<div id="t6_153" class="t s1_153">one cross from some grave. You carry the cross, you look more like Jesus, and I'll go </div>
<div id="t7_153" class="t s1_153">ahead of you proclaiming that the Lord has come. Let's see, maybe something is </div>
<div id="t8_153" class="t s1_153">possible." </div>
<div id="t9_153" class="t s1_153">So they entered the church. It was a Protestant church. The first entered and shouted </div>
<div id="ta_153" class="t s1_153">loudly, "Awake! Behold! The Lord has come back! He has fulfilled his promise." </div>
<div id="tb_153" class="t s1_153">Everybody looked and then entered the second hippie with the cross. A few women </div>
<div id="tc_153" class="t s1_153">fainted, a few old people fell at his feet. And people started giving money. When they </div>
<div id="td_153" class="t s1_153">went out they had collected fifty dollars. They were very happy. </div>
<div id="te_153" class="t s1_153">The week went beautifully -- marijuana and all. They enjoyed it as spiritually as </div>
<div id="tf_153" class="t s1_153">possible. </div>
<div id="tg_153" class="t s1_153">The next week they entered a Catholic church. Even more things became possible. The </div>
<div id="th_153" class="t s1_153">Catholics went crazy! They could not believe their eyes. People were crying and </div>
<div id="ti_153" class="t s1_153">weeping and trembling and calling "Lord!" They collected one hundred and fifty </div>
<div id="tj_153" class="t s1_153">dollars. That week they were really high</div>
<div id="tk_153" class="t s1_153">....</div>
<div id="tl_153" class="t s1_153">The third week, just for fun, they thought why not try the synagogue? So they went into </div>
<div id="tm_153" class="t s1_153">the synagogue. They proclaimed, "Behold! The Lord has come back as he promised!" </div>
<div id="tn_153" class="t s1_153">The old rabbi fixed his glasses, looked, and then asked his assistant, "You go and bring </div>
<div id="to_153" class="t s1_153">the hammer and nails -- it seems that fool has come back." </div>
<div id="tp_153" class="t s1_153">You behave according to your conditioning. </div>
<div id="tq_153" class="t s1_153">If Mahavira appears suddenly on M.G. Road, only Jainas -- and that too only </div>
<div id="tr_153" class="t s1_153">DIGAMBARA Jainas -- will recognize him. The SVETAMBARA Jainas, another sect of </div>
<div id="ts_153" class="t s1_153">the Jainas, will not recognize him because they don't believe that he lived naked. He </div>
<div id="tt_153" class="t s1_153">lived in white clothes -- of course those clothes were invisible. So they will ask, "Where </div>
<div id="tu_153" class="t s1_153">are the invisible clothes?" And Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians will simply </div>
<div id="tv_153" class="t s1_153">rush to the police station, because a naked man is standing on M.G. Road -- he seems to </div>
<div id="tw_153" class="t s1_153">be an Osho freak! </div>
<div id="tx_153" class="t s1_153">How are you going to judge? According to your prejudices. When you become </div>
<div id="ty_153" class="t s1_153">convinced that this man is saying the right thing, that simply means he is saying the </div>
<div id="tz_153" class="t s1_153">thing that you think is right. But if you know already what is right, there is no need to </div>
<div id="t10_153" class="t s1_153">bother about this man. </div>
<div id="t11_153" class="t s1_153">Following is useless, it is unnecessary. You are simply collecting support for your own </div>
<div id="t12_153" class="t s1_153">beliefs. It is not going to help, it is not going to change you. Only surrender transforms. </div>
<div id="t13_153" class="t s1_153">Anything that happens through the heart can bring a radical revolution into your being. </div>
<div id="t14_153" class="t s1_153">The head is impotent -- avoid the head. </div>
<div id="t15_153" class="t s1_153">Sir, avoid the head! Listen to the heart and follow the heart, then surrender happens of </div>
<div id="t16_153" class="t s1_153">its own accord. </div>
