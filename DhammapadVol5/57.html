<div id="t2_57" class="t s1_57">person is concerned with the body, the rich person is concerned with the mind. </div>
<div id="t3_57" class="t s1_57">And the psychiatrist, the psychoanalyst, can provide you with many consolations, </div>
<div id="t4_57" class="t s1_57">many adjustments. And, certainly, when you are disturbed anybody who looks </div>
<div id="t5_57" class="t s1_57">undisturbed, who looks very wise in his advice, who goes on analyzing your dreams, </div>
<div id="t6_57" class="t s1_57">looks as if he has a different level of being. It is not so. </div>
<div id="t7_57" class="t s1_57">All that psychoanalysis is doing is helping people to become adjusted. The Western </div>
<div id="t8_57" class="t s1_57">modern mind has become very maladjusted -- it is a good sign, it is the sign of a crisis, </div>
<div id="t9_57" class="t s1_57">an identity crisis. All the old values have become invalid, new values are needed. The </div>
<div id="ta_57" class="t s1_57">past has become irrelevant; we have succeeded so much in the West that we cannot live </div>
<div id="tb_57" class="t s1_57">with the values which were created when people were poor, remember it. </div>
<div id="tc_57" class="t s1_57">A poor society needs different values, a rich society needs different values. When a poor </div>
<div id="td_57" class="t s1_57">society succeeds in becoming rich it becomes maladjusted, because it goes on teaching </div>
<div id="te_57" class="t s1_57">the old values which are no longer relevant, and it lives in the new society which is rich. </div>
<div id="tf_57" class="t s1_57">So people's minds are in a mess. What has been told to them by the priest, by the school, </div>
<div id="tg_57" class="t s1_57">by the college and the university, belongs to the past. And the society has moved from </div>
<div id="th_57" class="t s1_57">there. It is as if you are taught the mechanism of a bullock cart and you have a car; you </div>
<div id="ti_57" class="t s1_57">will be maladjusted, because you know the mechanism of a bullock cart and you have a </div>
<div id="tj_57" class="t s1_57">Mercedes Benz. You are at a loss; your knowledge is irrelevant, but you cling to your </div>
<div id="tk_57" class="t s1_57">knowledge because that is all that you know. That's what is happening. </div>
<div id="tl_57" class="t s1_57">People were told for centuries to be ambitious, to have all kinds of riches, to succeed in </div>
<div id="tm_57" class="t s1_57">the world. Now it has all happened! Now to tell people to be rich, to be successful, is </div>
<div id="tn_57" class="t s1_57">utterly futile. They will laugh at you, they will say, "What nonsense are you talking </div>
<div id="to_57" class="t s1_57">about!" </div>
<div id="tp_57" class="t s1_57">Hence the hippies. In the East they cannot happen; old values are still relevant -- people </div>
<div id="tq_57" class="t s1_57">know about bullock carts and people have bullock carts. They fit perfectly well. But </div>
<div id="tr_57" class="t s1_57">Western technology, Western science, Western affluence, has gone far ahead of the </div>
<div id="ts_57" class="t s1_57">Western mind and attitudes. So everybody is at a loss. A person's knowledge does not </div>
<div id="tt_57" class="t s1_57">fit with the situation he lives in. He cannot drop the knowledge because by dropping </div>
<div id="tu_57" class="t s1_57">the knowledge he becomes almost ignorant. And there is no other knowledge available. </div>
<div id="tv_57" class="t s1_57">The function of the psychiatrist is to help these maladjusted people to become adjusted </div>
<div id="tw_57" class="t s1_57">again. This is not very revolutionary work; it is antirevolutionary, it is reactionary. </div>
<div id="tx_57" class="t s1_57">That's why I hit psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis has to herald the new age! And on the </div>
<div id="ty_57" class="t s1_57">contrary, what it is doing is helping people to become adjusted to the old, rotten society, </div>
<div id="tz_57" class="t s1_57">which is dying. Psychoanalysis has to help people towards the new man who is soon to </div>
<div id="t10_57" class="t s1_57">arrive on the horizon. That's my effort here. </div>
<div id="t11_57" class="t s1_57">My work is multidimensional. It is not only religious, it is not only educational, it is not </div>

<div id="t13_57" class="t s1_57">man will be a multidimensional man. And psychoanalysis is helping the old, rotten </div>
<div id="t14_57" class="t s1_57">society to survive better than it would survive without the help of psychoanalysis. </div>
<div id="t15_57" class="t s1_57">Priests, rabbis, and ministers often face anxieties, fears, and frustrations. This was the </div>
