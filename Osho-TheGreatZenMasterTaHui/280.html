<div id="t1_280" class="t s1_280">This is one of the most simple meditation techniques. Slowly, slowly everything settles by</div>
<div id="t2_280" class="t s1_280">this simple formula, and then there is no need for the technique. When you are cured, you</div>
<div id="t3_280" class="t s1_280">throw away the meditation, you throw away the medicine. Then you live as truth -- alive,</div>
<div id="t4_280" class="t s1_280">radiant, contented, blissful, a song unto yourself. Your whole life becomes a prayer without</div>
<div id="t5_280" class="t s1_280">any words, or better to say a prayerfulness, a grace, a beauty which does not belong to our</div>
<div id="t6_280" class="t s1_280">mundane world, a ray of light coming from the beyond into the darkness of our world.</div>
<div id="t7_280" class="t s1_280">WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH YOU SPEAK OF IT, AND WHEN YOU SHUT</div>
<div id="t8_280" class="t s1_280">YOUR MOUTH IT APPEARS BY ITSELF.</div>
<div id="t9_280" class="t s1_280">Even the mystics who have chosen to remain silent have been heard, and people have</div>
<div id="ta_280" class="t s1_280">come to them. Their silence was as loud, perhaps louder than their words could have been.</div>
<div id="tb_280" class="t s1_280">Even though they were living in the deserts or in the mountains, people have tracked them</div>
<div id="tc_280" class="t s1_280">down.</div>
<div id="td_280" class="t s1_280">Something invisible joins us all into one network, and whenever some point becomes</div>
<div id="te_280" class="t s1_280">luminous, suddenly the whole network feels the thrill. Those who are more sensitive feel</div>
<div id="tf_280" class="t s1_280">more; those who are less sensitive feel less; those who are intellectuals feel it, but interpret it</div>
<div id="tg_280" class="t s1_280">in such a way that they miss the point. Have you seen a spider's web? Just touch it from any</div>
<div id="th_280" class="t s1_280">place and the whole web will feel your touch; every fiber in it will be vibrating.</div>
<div id="ti_280" class="t s1_280">Ta Hui is right: "Even when your mouth is shut, it speaks." Whether you want anybody to</div>
<div id="tj_280" class="t s1_280">hear you or not, people from faraway places will start traveling towards you. Otherwise it</div>
<div id="tk_280" class="t s1_280">would have been almost impossible to find the silent mystics.</div>
<div id="tl_280" class="t s1_280">The story is told that when Jesus was born, three wise men from the East traveled to Judea</div>
<div id="tm_280" class="t s1_280">to pay their respects to the newborn baby. It is said that, in fact, that's how Jesus got his name:</div>
<div id="tn_280" class="t s1_280">when the first wise man entered into the stable where Jesus was born -- the door was small, it</div>
<div id="to_280" class="t s1_280">was made for donkeys, not for men -- he struck his head against the door and said, "Jesus!"</div>
<div id="tp_280" class="t s1_280">Mary said to Joseph, "That seems to be a very good name for the boy."</div>
<div id="tq_280" class="t s1_280">The story is mythological. It says, "A star led the way and guided them" -- otherwise how</div>
<div id="tr_280" class="t s1_280">were they going to find where this small child was? They were old, they had no time to wait,</div>
<div id="ts_280" class="t s1_280">and they had traveled thousands of miles. They were waiting, and a star led the way and</div>
<div id="tt_280" class="t s1_280">stopped exactly over the stable. This is a mythological or perhaps a poetic way of saying it,</div>
<div id="tu_280" class="t s1_280">but it has some truth in it; it is not just a fabrication, a beautiful story.</div>
<div id="tv_280" class="t s1_280">First, all the three wise men came from the East. Perhaps the West was not able to be so</div>
<div id="tw_280" class="t s1_280">sensitive as to understand Jesus, and that too when he was just a baby. They did not</div>
<div id="tx_280" class="t s1_280">understand him even when he was thirty-three, when they crucified him, and they have not</div>
<div id="ty_280" class="t s1_280">understood him even today! They worship him, but that worship is just a sociality; half the</div>
<div id="tz_280" class="t s1_280">world is Christian, but that is simply politics.</div>
<div id="t10_280" class="t s1_280">It is significant that all three old men came from the East. My understanding is that the</div>
<div id="t11_280" class="t s1_280">light was not of a star shining ahead of them and leading them to the place. The East has its</div>
<div id="t12_280" class="t s1_280">own explanations, which Christians have never been able to understand. The light was the</div>
<div id="t13_280" class="t s1_280">third eye of these three old wise men -- it is also called "the star" -- and it led them in the right</div>
<div id="t14_280" class="t s1_280">direction.</div>
<div id="t15_280" class="t s1_280">Stars don't move that way; stars go round and round, they cannot go straight. And stars are</div>
<div id="t16_280" class="t s1_280">far away -- even if it were to stop exactly above the stable you would not be able to figure out</div>
<div id="t17_280" class="t s1_280">where the stable is because that star is so far away that the stable could be anywhere on the</div>
<div id="t18_280" class="t s1_280">earth.</div>
<div id="t19_280" class="t s1_280">Chapter 23 - So very close</div>
<div id="t1a_280" class="t s1_280">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1b_280" class="t s1_280">280</div>
