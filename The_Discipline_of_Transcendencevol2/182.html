<div id="t1_182" class="t s1_182">He said, 'By the time I was twenty-one I thought it is easier to change my mind </div>
<div id="t2_182" class="t s1_182">than to become the richest man in the world. It is easier to change my mind.' </div>
<div id="t3_182" class="t s1_182">Everybody wants to become the richest man of the world. Everybody wants to be </div>
<div id="t4_182" class="t s1_182">the most powerful man in the world. Everybody wants to be the most strong, </div>
<div id="t5_182" class="t s1_182">beautiful, intelligent, famous in the world. Of course much anxiety is created. In </div>
<div id="t6_182" class="t s1_182">that anxiety you are in a sort of continuous illness, dis-ease, restlessness, a fever, </div>
<div id="t7_182" class="t s1_182">in which you go on, continuously trembling. And every moment there is </div>
<div id="t8_182" class="t s1_182">frustration waiting for you. </div>
<div id="t9_182" class="t s1_182">Hence people say, 'Man proposes and god disposes.' God has never disposed </div>
<div id="ta_182" class="t s1_182">anything. In your very proposition you are disposing god, hence you get in </div>
<div id="tb_182" class="t s1_182">trouble. Because the nature has its own way, the tao has its own way; it has its </div>
<div id="tc_182" class="t s1_182">own destiny. It is as if a part is trying to go on its own journey, leaving the whole </div>
<div id="td_182" class="t s1_182">behind. It is not possible -- the part has to go with the whole. The tail has to go </div>
<div id="te_182" class="t s1_182">with the elephant. If the tail starts going on its own way against the elephant, </div>
<div id="tf_182" class="t s1_182">separate from the elephant, then there is going to be trouble -- the tail will go </div>
<div id="tg_182" class="t s1_182">mad. And actually it will have to drag with the elephant; there is no other way. </div>
<div id="th_182" class="t s1_182">So there are only two types of people in the world. One, who have private goals -</div>
<div id="ti_182" class="t s1_182">- they feel they are being dragged; they feel man proposes, god disposes. Then </div>
<div id="tj_182" class="t s1_182">there is another type of people in the world -- very few, rare, far, far and few </div>
<div id="tk_182" class="t s1_182">between, very few -- who have dropped all their propositions. They don't drag, </div>
<div id="tl_182" class="t s1_182">they dance. They dance, because whatsoever god proposes they accept. And they </div>
<div id="tm_182" class="t s1_182">have no private propositions, they don't have any desire of their own. </div>
<div id="tn_182" class="t s1_182">That's what Jesus says on the cross, that is his last message to the world -- 'Thy </div>
<div id="to_182" class="t s1_182">kingdom come, Thy will be done'. Just a moment before he has hesitated a little, </div>
<div id="tp_182" class="t s1_182">just a moment before he shouted and said, 'Why have you forsaken me? Why? </div>
<div id="tq_182" class="t s1_182">Why are you showing me all this?' </div>
<div id="tr_182" class="t s1_182">You cannot complain against Jesus -- that too is natural and human. He was only </div>
<div id="ts_182" class="t s1_182">thirty-three, he was not yet old, he was just young, he had not seen the whole life </div>
<div id="tt_182" class="t s1_182">yet, he had not tasted, he had not lived yet -- and suddenly he finds himself on </div>
<div id="tu_182" class="t s1_182">the Cross, ridiculed, insulted, rejected by his own people. And it is natural that </div>
<div id="tv_182" class="t s1_182">he shouts at god, 'Why have you forsaken me? Why are you showing me all </div>
<div id="tw_182" class="t s1_182">this?' -- human, very human. </div>
<div id="tx_182" class="t s1_182">But immediately he became aware of it. It must have escaped -- this shouting </div>
<div id="ty_182" class="t s1_182">against god -- in a moment of unawareness. The pain may have been too much, </div>
<div id="tz_182" class="t s1_182">the misery was too much. Death was just close by; he was shocked. But he </div>
<div id="t10_182" class="t s1_182">regained balance. He was going to propose something. He simply said, 'Thy </div>
<div id="t11_182" class="t s1_182">kingdom come, Thy will be done.' He surrendered. He died as Christ. </div>
<div id="t12_182" class="t s1_182">In a single moment he was no more Jesus, he was Christ. In a single moment he </div>
<div id="t13_182" class="t s1_182">was no more human, he was superhuman. The gap is very small. That's why </div>
<div id="t14_182" class="t s1_182">Buddha says, 'Miss it by a single inch, or by a single moment and you are thrown </div>
<div id="t15_182" class="t s1_182">millions of miles away.' Just a single inch was the difference between these two </div>
<div id="t16_182" class="t s1_182">sentences -- there was not much gap, maybe a single breath. But he was just </div>
