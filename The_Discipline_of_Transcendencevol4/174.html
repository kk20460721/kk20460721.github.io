<div id="t1_174" class="t s1_174">Bodhidharma lived in China for many years, and then one day he decided that </div>
<div id="t2_174" class="t s1_174">now the time had come for him to go back to his home. He wanted to return to </div>
<div id="t3_174" class="t s1_174">the Himalayas, he wanted to die in the Himalayas. He gathered his disciples, the </div>
<div id="t4_174" class="t s1_174">four foremost disciples, and he asked them, "What is truth?" </div>
<div id="t5_174" class="t s1_174">The first said something which was philosophical, logical, very systematic, but </div>
<div id="t6_174" class="t s1_174">Bodhidharma was not happy. He looked very sad. He said, "You have only my </div>
<div id="t7_174" class="t s1_174">skin." </div>
<div id="t8_174" class="t s1_174">He asked the other; he said something. His answer was a little better than the </div>
<div id="t9_174" class="t s1_174">first one: more intuitive, less intellectual, more poetic, more musical. </div>
<div id="ta_174" class="t s1_174">Bodhidharma said, "You have my flesh"; but still he was not very happy. </div>
<div id="tb_174" class="t s1_174">He asked the third the same question: what is truth? The third was still better; he </div>
<div id="tc_174" class="t s1_174">said something which was more existential, had a glimpse of realization in it, just </div>
<div id="td_174" class="t s1_174">a ray of light. Bodhidharma was not unhappy, but not yet happy. He said, "You </div>
<div id="te_174" class="t s1_174">have my bones." </div>
<div id="tf_174" class="t s1_174">And then he asked the fourth, and the fourth said nothing. The fourth answered </div>
<div id="tg_174" class="t s1_174">with silence. Bodhidharma looked into his eyes: they were like an infinite abyss, </div>
<div id="th_174" class="t s1_174">a bottomless abyss. And the disciple fell unto his feet without uttering a word. </div>
<div id="ti_174" class="t s1_174">Bodhidharma must have danced in his innermost being. He was tremendously </div>
<div id="tj_174" class="t s1_174">happy; at least one had understood him totally. He said, "You have my marrow, </div>
<div id="tk_174" class="t s1_174">my very soul." </div>
<div id="tl_174" class="t s1_174">These four were all cannibals; they were eating the Master. But one produced </div>
<div id="tm_174" class="t s1_174">only the skin; the other produced flesh; the third produced bones; the fourth </div>
<div id="tn_174" class="t s1_174">exactly reflected the Master, gave birth to the Master again in his being. </div>

<div id="tp_174" class="t s1_174">not that there is something to be told to you. It is just a device. It is just a device </div>
<div id="tq_174" class="t s1_174">so you can be close to me; it is just a device so you can be engaged in listening </div>
<div id="tr_174" class="t s1_174">and your being can be in deeper contact with me. You have learned the ways of </div>
<div id="ts_174" class="t s1_174">language; it is very difficult for you to sit silently with me. If you sit silently you </div>
<div id="tt_174" class="t s1_174">will be far away, you will be lost in your thoughts. There will be a great distance </div>
<div id="tu_174" class="t s1_174">between me and you. I have tried that. </div>
<div id="tv_174" class="t s1_174">I used to sit silently with people, but I found they were FAR away, thousands of </div>
<div id="tw_174" class="t s1_174">miles away in their thoughts. They look physically just close; spiritually they are </div>
<div id="tx_174" class="t s1_174">not there at all: somebody is moving into his past, somebody has already moved </div>
<div id="ty_174" class="t s1_174">into some imagination in the future. I used to look into them and I found they </div>
<div id="tz_174" class="t s1_174">were not there, they were somewhere else. Only their bodies were there -- empty </div>
<div id="t10_174" class="t s1_174">shells, hollow. Their minds were not there. And if your mind is not there it is </div>
<div id="t11_174" class="t s1_174">very difficult for your soul to be there. </div>
<div id="t12_174" class="t s1_174">I talk to you so your mind becomes engaged in my thoughts. While you are </div>
<div id="t13_174" class="t s1_174">engaged in my thoughts, at least you will be able to avoid your thoughts. You </div>
<div id="t14_174" class="t s1_174">will be closer to me -- closer than you can be while you are thinking your </div>
<div id="t15_174" class="t s1_174">thoughts. At least my thoughts are mine: they come from a deep emptiness, they </div>
<div id="t16_174" class="t s1_174">carry the flavor, they have a subtle vibe in them. While engaged with me in a </div>
<div id="t17_174" class="t s1_174">verbal communication, listening to me attentively, your mind becomes engaged, </div>
