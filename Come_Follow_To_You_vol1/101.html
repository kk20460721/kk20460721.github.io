<div id="t3_101" class="t s1_101">You have to ask how to sleep, how to relax. They were natural one day, just like </div>
<div id="t4_101" class="t s1_101">breathing. Go and ask a primitive: he will simply laugh if you ask, "How do you </div>
<div id="t5_101" class="t s1_101">go so deeply into sleep?" </div>
<div id="t6_101" class="t s1_101">He will say, "What a foolish question! I simply put my head down and go to </div>
<div id="t7_101" class="t s1_101">sleep. There is no HOW to it." </div>
<div id="t8_101" class="t s1_101">But you will say, "Still, there must be a trick because I try hard and nothing </div>

<div id="tc_101" class="t s1_101">One day or another, man is going to ask how to breathe and then, if you say, </div>
<div id="td_101" class="t s1_101">'You just breathe; there is no HOW to it," he will not believe you. How to love, </div>
<div id="te_101" class="t s1_101">how to live, how to laugh, how to be happy -- these are all simple things, no </div>
<div id="tf_101" class="t s1_101">HOW is needed. These are natural things, they are not techniques. </div>
<div id="tg_101" class="t s1_101">This is how Jesus is. He loves the way he says his parables. He loves it! He knows </div>
<div id="th_101" class="t s1_101">he has an intrinsic knack of telling parables. </div>
<div id="ti_101" class="t s1_101">A parable is not arithmetic. It should not be too clear, otherwise the point is lost. </div>
<div id="tj_101" class="t s1_101">It should be a persuasion, it should not be an advertisement. It should not argue </div>
<div id="tk_101" class="t s1_101">because then the point is lost -- then why not argue, why say a parable? It should </div>
<div id="tl_101" class="t s1_101">not give proofs, it should only supply hints; and that, too, not completely. Just a </div>

<div id="tn_101" class="t s1_101">I have heard about Chuang Tzu that he was talking to his disciples and many of </div>
<div id="to_101" class="t s1_101">them were fast asleep, as disciples are. It must have been late at night and they </div>
<div id="tp_101" class="t s1_101">were tired, and Chuang Tzu was saying difficult things that were beyond them. </div>
<div id="tq_101" class="t s1_101">When something is beyond you, it seems better to rest and sleep than to bother </div>
<div id="tr_101" class="t s1_101">with it. </div>
<div id="ts_101" class="t s1_101">Suddenly Chuang Tzu became aware that many of the disciples were fast asleep </div>
<div id="tt_101" class="t s1_101">and it was useless. They were even snoring and disturbing him. So he told a </div>
<div id="tu_101" class="t s1_101">parable. He said: "Once it happened that a man had a donkey and he was </div>
<div id="tv_101" class="t s1_101">travelling on a pilgrimage towards some holy place. But he was very poor, and it </div>
<div id="tw_101" class="t s1_101">came to pass that he was hungry. No money was left, so he sold the donkey, on </div>
<div id="tx_101" class="t s1_101">which he was riding, to another traveller who was rich. But the next afternoon, </div>
<div id="ty_101" class="t s1_101">when the sun was very hot, the first owner rested in the shadow by the side of </div>
<div id="tz_101" class="t s1_101">the donkey. </div>
<div id="t10_101" class="t s1_101">"The second owner said, 'This is not good. You have sold the donkey.' </div>
<div id="t11_101" class="t s1_101">"The first owner said, 'I have sold the donkey, but not the shadow.' " </div>
<div id="t12_101" class="t s1_101">Everybody became alert -- nobody was asleep, nobody was snoring. When you </div>
<div id="t13_101" class="t s1_101">talk about donkeys, donkeys hear it immediately! Chuang Tzu said, "I am </div>
<div id="t14_101" class="t s1_101">finished with the story. Now I come to my point." </div>
<div id="t15_101" class="t s1_101">But they all said, "Wait! Please finish the story." </div>
<div id="t16_101" class="t s1_101">Chuang Tzu said, "It was a parable, not a story. You are more interested in </div>
<div id="t17_101" class="t s1_101">donkeys than you are in me". </div>
