<div id="t1_338" class="t s1_338">He was hoping that the saint would say, "No, I don't need these golden beds and marble</div>
<div id="t2_338" class="t s1_338">palaces. I am a naked monk, more in tune with the trees, with the wind, with the cold, with the</div>
<div id="t3_338" class="t s1_338">heat." But instead of this, the man became very interested. He said, "Great! This is the right</div>
<div id="t4_338" class="t s1_338">place!"</div>
<div id="t5_338" class="t s1_338">The king could not sleep the whole night, although the monk slept the whole night</div>
<div id="t6_338" class="t s1_338">perfectly well in those luxurious surroundings. From that morning the monk's respectability in</div>
<div id="t7_338" class="t s1_338">the mind of the king went down every day, because he was eating luxurious food, he was no</div>
<div id="t8_338" class="t s1_338">longer naked, he was using the costliest robes. He was not worried about women -- the most</div>
<div id="t9_338" class="t s1_338">beautiful women were serving him and he was quite at ease, as if nothing had happened. He</div>
<div id="ta_338" class="t s1_338">looked just the same as he did naked under the tree.</div>
<div id="tb_338" class="t s1_338">But it was too much; it was becoming a wound in the king's heart that he had really been</div>
<div id="tc_338" class="t s1_338">befooled, cheated. Now, how to get rid of this man? He is not a saint ... One day he asked him,</div>
<div id="td_338" class="t s1_338">"I have been carrying a question in my mind for many, many days, but have not been</div>
<div id="te_338" class="t s1_338">courageous enough to ask."</div>
<div id="tf_338" class="t s1_338">The man said, "I know -- not many, many days, but from the very moment when I accepted</div>
<div id="tg_338" class="t s1_338">your invitation."</div>
<div id="th_338" class="t s1_338">The king was again shocked. He said, "What do you mean?"</div>
<div id="ti_338" class="t s1_338">He said, "I could see that very moment the change in your face, in your eyes. If I had</div>
<div id="tj_338" class="t s1_338">rejected your offer, you would have respected me, touched my feet. But I don't reject anything.</div>
<div id="tk_338" class="t s1_338">My acceptance is total. If you are inviting me, it is perfectly good. When I said the palace is</div>
<div id="tl_338" class="t s1_338">right, it is not the palace that is right, I am right wherever I am. I was right under the tree</div>
<div id="tm_338" class="t s1_338">naked; I am right under these royal robes, surrounded by beautiful women, all the luxuries.</div>
<div id="tn_338" class="t s1_338">Naturally I know you must be very puzzled. You look tired, you look sad, you don't look your</div>
<div id="to_338" class="t s1_338">old self. You can ask me the question, although I know the question."</div>
<div id="tp_338" class="t s1_338">The king said, "If you know the question, then the question now is that I want to know</div>
<div id="tq_338" class="t s1_338">what is the difference between me and you?"</div>
<div id="tr_338" class="t s1_338">The young man laughed and he said, "I will answer, but not here because you will not</div>
<div id="ts_338" class="t s1_338">understand it. We will go for a morning walk, and at the right place, at the right moment, I</div>
<div id="tt_338" class="t s1_338">will answer."</div>
<div id="tu_338" class="t s1_338">So they both went on the horses for a good morning ride, and the king was waiting and</div>
<div id="tv_338" class="t s1_338">waiting. It was a beautiful morning, but he was not there to enjoy the morning; only the young</div>
<div id="tw_338" class="t s1_338">man was enjoying. Finally the king said, "Now this river is the boundary of my empire.</div>
<div id="tx_338" class="t s1_338">Beyond the river I cannot go; that belongs to someone with whom we have been enemies for</div>
<div id="ty_338" class="t s1_338">centuries. We have ridden miles, and now it is time enough. It is getting hot, the middle of the</div>
<div id="tz_338" class="t s1_338">day."</div>
<div id="t10_338" class="t s1_338">The man said, "Yes, my answer is -- this is your robe, this is your horse" -- and getting off</div>
<div id="t11_338" class="t s1_338">his horse, he took off the robe. He said, "I am going to the other side of the river, because I</div>
<div id="t12_338" class="t s1_338">don't have any enemies. This robe was never mine, and this horse was never mine. Just one</div>
<div id="t13_338" class="t s1_338">small question: Are you coming with me or not?"</div>
<div id="t14_338" class="t s1_338">The king said, "How can I come with you? I have to look after the kingdom. My whole</div>
<div id="t15_338" class="t s1_338">life's work, struggle, fight, ambition is behind me in the kingdom. How can I go with you?"</div>
<div id="t16_338" class="t s1_338">Chapter 29 - Faith</div>
<div id="t17_338" class="t s1_338">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t18_338" class="t s1_338">338</div>
