<div id="t1_66" class="t s1_66">The ego cannot be repressed, remember. It has to be simply evaporated -- through the </div>
<div id="t2_66" class="t s1_66">heat of understanding, through the fire of understanding. If you repress it, it is easy. You </div>
<div id="t3_66" class="t s1_66">can become humble, you can become simple, but it will hide behind your simplicity. </div>
<div id="t4_66" class="t s1_66">A woman told her doctor that she was convinced she had a very dangerous illness. He </div>
<div id="t5_66" class="t s1_66">advised her not to be so foolish, that she could not possibly know whether she had it or </div>
<div id="t6_66" class="t s1_66">not because, "the disease," he added, "carries with it no discomfort whatsoever!" </div>
<div id="t7_66" class="t s1_66">So there is no way for her to know. </div>
<div id="t8_66" class="t s1_66">"But doctor," she told him, "that's exactly how I feel -- no discomfort whatsoever! The </div>
<div id="t9_66" class="t s1_66">disease is there." </div>
<div id="ta_66" class="t s1_66">You can go on deceiving yourself and you can find rationalizations, and on the surface </div>
<div id="tb_66" class="t s1_66">they look very reasonable -- on the surface they look almost like proofs -- but look into </div>
<div id="tc_66" class="t s1_66">them. </div>
<div id="td_66" class="t s1_66">And it is nobody else's business, remember. It is for you to see. The whole world can see </div>
<div id="te_66" class="t s1_66">it, but if you have Not seen it that is useless. </div>
<div id="tf_66" class="t s1_66">Now modern psychology is by and by turning from individual therapy to group therapy, </div>
<div id="tg_66" class="t s1_66">and the only reason for it is this: that it is very difficult for the psychoanalyst to convince </div>
<div id="th_66" class="t s1_66">the patient, person to person, about what he is doing to himself. About the patient, about </div>
<div id="ti_66" class="t s1_66">his complexes, about his rationalizations, repressions, about his deceptions, stupidities; it </div>
<div id="tj_66" class="t s1_66">is very difficult to convince him person to person. But in a group it becomes easier </div>
<div id="tk_66" class="t s1_66">because the whole group can see the foolishness, the obviousness of it -- that he is </div>
<div id="tl_66" class="t s1_66">clinging to something and unnccessarily becoming miserable. The whole group can see it, </div>
<div id="tm_66" class="t s1_66">and the understanding of the whole group functions more tremendously and deeply than </div>
<div id="tn_66" class="t s1_66">the understanding of one person can function on you. That's why group therapy is </div>
<div id="to_66" class="t s1_66">growing, individual therapy is disappearing. </div>
<div id="tp_66" class="t s1_66">Group therapy has a tremendous advantage. Twenty persons working in a group: nineteen </div>
<div id="tq_66" class="t s1_66">persons become alert that you are doing something which you don't want to do and to </div>
<div id="tr_66" class="t s1_66">which you are still clinging. </div>
<div id="ts_66" class="t s1_66">A sannyasin came to me, a very good man, but he was feeling very, very happy because I </div>
<div id="tt_66" class="t s1_66">had given him a beautiful name. I give beautiful names to everybody. He had made an </div>
<div id="tu_66" class="t s1_66">ego trip out of it. He said, "Osho, you are wonderful. You have given me such a beautiful </div>
<div id="tv_66" class="t s1_66">name -- it exactly represents me." Your names don't represent you. These are my hopes, </div>
<div id="tw_66" class="t s1_66">not realities. These are my dreams, not realities. I called that sannyasin "Satyananda" -- </div>
<div id="tx_66" class="t s1_66">the bliss that arises out of the experience of truth. Hmm?... that is the ultimate. But he </div>
<div id="ty_66" class="t s1_66">said, "Osho, 'Satyananda' -- you have exactly, exactly got me. I am so impressed by your </div>
<div id="tz_66" class="t s1_66">understanding." </div>
<div id="t10_66" class="t s1_66">Now I became alert that this had been very, very wrong. It had been a misunderstanding. </div>
<div id="t11_66" class="t s1_66">I should not have given him this name. I wanted to pull him down from his euphoria, so </div>
<div id="t12_66" class="t s1_66">when after a few minutes he started saying, "I don't want anger, greed, this and that; these </div>
<div id="t13_66" class="t s1_66">are all animalistic"; I said, "Don't be a coward." Immediately he exploded: "Coward? You </div>
<div id="t14_66" class="t s1_66">call me a coward?" He was almost ready to hit me, screamed -- completely forgot about </div>
<div id="t15_66" class="t s1_66">satyananda -- and he started defending himself. "Why have you called me a coward? I am </div>
<div id="t16_66" class="t s1_66">not a coward." And I told him, "If you are not a coward, then why are you defending? </div>
