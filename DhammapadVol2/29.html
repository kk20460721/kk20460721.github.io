<div id="tf_29" class="t s1_29">NIETZSCHE THAT GOD IS DEAD? </div>
<div id="tg_29" class="t s1_29">Neeraj, Friedrich Nietzsche says God is dead -- that means he was alive before. As far as </div>
<div id="th_29" class="t s1_29">I know, he has never been alive. How can God be dead if he has never been alive? God </div>
<div id="ti_29" class="t s1_29">is not a person, so he cannot be alive and he cannot be dead. To me, God is life itself! </div>
<div id="tj_29" class="t s1_29">God is synonymous with existence; hence you cannot say God is alive or God is dead. </div>
<div id="tk_29" class="t s1_29">God is life! And life is forever...it is a continuum, it is eternal, no beginning, no end. </div>
<div id="tl_29" class="t s1_29">Nietzsche was really saying that the God that people had worshipped up to then had </div>
<div id="tm_29" class="t s1_29">become irrelevant. But he was very much accustomed to making dramatic statements. </div>
<div id="tn_29" class="t s1_29">Rather than saying: "The God that people have worshipped up to now is no longer </div>
<div id="to_29" class="t s1_29">relevant," he said: "God is dead." And in a way, dramatic statements penetrate people's </div>
<div id="tp_29" class="t s1_29">consciousness more. If he had said it in a philosophical way it may have missed the </div>
<div id="tq_29" class="t s1_29">target, but it became the most important statement made in these hundred years. No </div>
<div id="tr_29" class="t s1_29">other statement has had such significance, or has had such an impact on human </div>
<div id="ts_29" class="t s1_29">thinking, behavior, life. </div>
<div id="tt_29" class="t s1_29">The Christian God is dead, the Jewish God is dead -- that's what Nietzsche was saying. </div>
<div id="tu_29" class="t s1_29">But there have been so many gods and all have gone down the drain. If you make a list </div>
<div id="tv_29" class="t s1_29">you will be surprised how many gods have been worshipped. One man has made a list. </div>
<div id="tw_29" class="t s1_29">I was reading the list -- not even a single name that he mentions is known. Nearabout </div>
