<div id="t2_104" class="t s1_104">everything is settled, all enemies killed -- I was just thinking to relax and enjoy. Is this </div>
<div id="t3_104" class="t s1_104">the time to come? All these hundred years have been spent simply in preparing for </div>
<div id="t4_104" class="t s1_104">these moments. Spare me just one hundred years more so that I can live to my heart's </div>
<div id="t5_104" class="t s1_104">content." </div>
<div id="t6_104" class="t s1_104">Death laughed and said, "I am ready to spare one hundred years more to you, but I will </div>
<div id="t7_104" class="t s1_104">have to take one of your sons because I have to go with somebody who resembles you; </div>
<div id="t8_104" class="t s1_104">if not you, at least one of your sons. I can't go empty-handed, I have to give the account </div>
<div id="t9_104" class="t s1_104">to my boss himself. He will ask, 'Where is Yayati?' What am I going to say? Such a thing </div>
<div id="ta_104" class="t s1_104">has never been done before, but I feel sorry for you. Just ask one of your sons." </div>
<div id="tb_104" class="t s1_104">Yayati had a hundred sons; he must have had a hundred wives too. He asked his sons. </div>
<div id="tc_104" class="t s1_104">The oldest was eighty, but he started looking downwards, was not ready to say yes. </div>
<div id="td_104" class="t s1_104">Why should he? He had lived only eighty years; if his father is not contented with a </div>
<div id="te_104" class="t s1_104">hundred years, how can he be contented with only eighty years? At least twenty years </div>
<div id="tf_104" class="t s1_104">more he is entitled to live. In those days, the story says, people used to live a hundred </div>
<div id="tg_104" class="t s1_104">years. Why should he die a premature death, an untimely death? And this old fellow </div>
<div id="th_104" class="t s1_104">has lived enough! He did not want to hurt the old man so he didn't say anything, he </div>
<div id="ti_104" class="t s1_104">kept quiet. </div>
<div id="tj_104" class="t s1_104">The father was very much shocked; he used to think that his sons were ready to </div>
<div id="tk_104" class="t s1_104">sacrifice themselves. But in this world nobody is ready to sacrifice himself for anybody </div>
<div id="tl_104" class="t s1_104">else. He looked around. His sons also started looking at each other, meaning "Why </div>
<div id="tm_104" class="t s1_104">don't YOU go?" </div>
<div id="tn_104" class="t s1_104">The youngest, who was only twenty years old, stood up and he said, "I am ready. Take </div>
<div id="to_104" class="t s1_104">me with you, I am coming with you." </div>
<div id="tp_104" class="t s1_104">Even Death felt sorry for the boy. Death came close to the young man and said, "Are </div>
<div id="tq_104" class="t s1_104">you a fool or something? Your other brothers -- one is eighty, one is seventy-five, one is </div>
<div id="tr_104" class="t s1_104">seventy, sixty, sixty-five, fifty -- these people are not ready to go and you are the </div>
<div id="ts_104" class="t s1_104">youngest, you have not lived at all. Why are you ready to go?" </div>
<div id="tt_104" class="t s1_104">The young man said, "If my father could not live in a hundred years, if my eldest </div>
<div id="tu_104" class="t s1_104">brother could not live in eighty years, if my other brothers... nobody has been able to </div>
<div id="tv_104" class="t s1_104">live, then the whole project is nonsense. I don't want to waste time. If I have to die it is </div>
<div id="tw_104" class="t s1_104">better to die now. Why wait for eighty years? If THESE people have not been able to </div>
<div id="tx_104" class="t s1_104">manage, it is absolutely certain it is unmanageable. And let my father try a hundred </div>
<div id="ty_104" class="t s1_104">years more." </div>
<div id="tz_104" class="t s1_104">Death tried to convince him, but he wouldn't listen. Death had to take him away. </div>
<div id="t10_104" class="t s1_104">After a hundred years, Death came back and the situation was the same. Again Yayati </div>
<div id="t11_104" class="t s1_104">fell at his feet and started crying and weeping and he said, "I know that now I should be </div>
<div id="t12_104" class="t s1_104">ready, but nothing is fulfilled yet; all the desires are the same. I have LIVED all the </div>
<div id="t13_104" class="t s1_104">desires, I cannot say that I have not lived them, but nothing is fulfilled. I want more! </div>
<div id="t14_104" class="t s1_104">Now that I have lived a hundred years a new desire has arisen -- I want more! I want to </div>
<div id="t15_104" class="t s1_104">live at least one time more, a hundred years more, just one time more." </div>
<div id="t16_104" class="t s1_104">And this went on happening again and again. When Yayati became one thousand years </div>
<div id="t17_104" class="t s1_104">old and Death came, he was just going to fall at his feet. Death said, "Wait -- enough is </div>
