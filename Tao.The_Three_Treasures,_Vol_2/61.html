<div id="t2_61" class="t s2_61">that he has brought his intelligence to understand it, no, that would be postponing – his total being</div>
<div id="t3_61" class="t s2_61">understands it, not only the intellectual part. Not only his soul, not only his mind, but even his body</div>
<div id="t4_61" class="t s2_61">vibrates in a new unknown way. A new dance has entered into his being, and now he can never be</div>
<div id="t5_61" class="t s2_61">the same.</div>
<div id="t6_61" class="t s2_61">Once he has heard about the truth he can never be the old again, a new journey has started. Now</div>
<div id="t7_61" class="t s2_61">nothing can be done, he has to move. He has heard about light and he has been living in darkness:</div>
<div id="t8_61" class="t s2_61">now unless he achieves it there will be no rest for him, he will become deeply discontented. He has</div>
<div id="t9_61" class="t s2_61">heard that a different type of existence is possible: now unless he reaches it, attains it, he cannot be</div>
<div id="ta_61" class="t s2_61">at ease, he cannot be at home anywhere. Wherever he will be, the constant call from the unknown</div>
<div id="tb_61" class="t s2_61">will be knocking at the door continuously: waking he will hear it, sleeping he will hear it, dreaming –</div>
<div id="tc_61" class="t s2_61">and the knock will be there, he will hear it. Eating he will hear it, walking he will hear it, in the shop,</div>
<div id="td_61" class="t s2_61">in the market, he will hear it – it will be a continuously haunting phenomenon.</div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s2_61">Just by hearing? Mahavir said that there are two types of people, and Jains have not understood it at</div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s2_61">all. A very revolutionary thought has been completely lost by misunderstanding. He said: There are</div>
<div id="tg_61" class="t s2_61">two types of people. One type become MUKTAS, become liberated just by hearing. They are called</div>
<div id="th_61" class="t s2_61">SHRAVAKAS. The word SHRAVAK means ’one who has heard and just by hearing is transformed.’</div>
<div id="ti_61" class="t s2_61">Then there is a second type who cannot become liberated just by hearing, they have to practice it.</div>
<div id="tj_61" class="t s2_61">They are called SADHUS. Now a great misunderstanding exists: the SHRAVAK has to bow down</div>
<div id="tk_61" class="t s2_61">before the SADHU. In fact just the opposite should be the case because the SHRAVAK is a greater</div>
<div id="tl_61" class="t s2_61">soul. He has attained just by hearing, but the SADHU has to practice – just by hearing he could</div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s2_61">not attain. His receptivity is not so keen, his sensitivity is dull. He is not a ﬁrst-rate mind, he is a</div>
<div id="tn_61" class="t s2_61">second-rate mind, a mediocre mind.</div>
<div id="to_61" class="t s2_61">This you can see. If you go and look at the SADHUS of the Jains you can immediately feel they</div>
<div id="tp_61" class="t s2_61">are dull: some intelligence is lacking, their perception is not total. They are taking years to practise</div>
<div id="tq_61" class="t s2_61">a thing which can be understood immediately. They are doing it the hard way because they don’t</div>
<div id="tr_61" class="t s2_61">have the intelligence to choose the direct, straight, easiest way, simply and spontaneously. They</div>
<div id="ts_61" class="t s2_61">are doing a thousand and one things to attain that which can be attained with a perceptive mind</div>
<div id="tt_61" class="t s2_61">immediately without doing anything.</div>
<div id="tu_61" class="t s2_61">In fact, a man who becomes aware just by hearing has a greater quality of consciousness than a</div>
<div id="tv_61" class="t s2_61">man who has had to work for it for years, to do SADHANA, to practice this and that. He is a dullard,</div>
<div id="tw_61" class="t s2_61">a mediocre mind. I have been observing thousands of people, I have met all types of people, but</div>
<div id="tx_61" class="t s2_61">SADHUS have always appeared to me to be a little dull, and I was always worried: What is the</div>
<div id="ty_61" class="t s2_61">matter? Why do they look a little dull, a little mediocre? Their intelligence is not of the highest quality</div>
<div id="tz_61" class="t s2_61">– by and by I understood that the reason that they could not attain to it just by hearing, was because</div>
<div id="t10_61" class="t s2_61">they didn’t have the intelligence.</div>
<div id="t11_61" class="t s2_61">That’s why Krishnamurti goes on saying that there is no need to do anything. In fact, for the ﬁrst-rate</div>
<div id="t12_61" class="t s2_61">mind there is no need to do anything; just by hearing, by right listening, one attains.</div>
<div id="t13_61" class="t s2_61">But where</div>
<div id="t14_61" class="t s2_61">to ﬁnd the ﬁrst-rate mind? It is very rare. Unless a Krishnamurti comes to listen to Krishnamurti it</div>
<div id="t15_61" class="t s2_61">won’t happen. But why should a Krishnamurti go to listen to a Krishnamurti? It is absurd. It has</div>
<div id="t16_61" class="t s2_61">no meaning. A man who has that kind of perceptivity can become awakened just by listening to</div>
<div id="t17_61" class="t s2_61">the song of a bird, just by listening to the breeze passing through the trees, just by listening to the</div>
<div id="t18_61" class="t s2_61">sound of the water ﬂowing – that’s enough, because from everywhere the Divine speaks. If you are</div>
<div id="t19_61" class="t s2_61">perceptive, whatsoever you hear you have heard the Divine.</div>
<div id="t1a_61" class="t s2_61">Tao: The Three Treasures, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t1b_61" class="t s2_61">61</div>
