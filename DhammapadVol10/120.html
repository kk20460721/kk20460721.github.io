<div id="t1_120" class="t s1_120">don't believe in science fiction, and don't act out of that belief; otherwise you will end </div>
<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">up in a madhouse. </div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">Occultism is exactly like science fiction. People love fiction; there is nothing wrong in it, </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">but you should know that it is fiction. Enjoy, but don't take it seriously. </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">In Buddha's time there were eight great masters. Mahavira is well-known -- he was the </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">last enlightened master of the tradition of the Jainas. He used to say there are three </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">hells. One of his disciples became a renegade, betrayed him, declared himself to be a </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">master, and he started talking about seven hells. He used to say to people, "Mahavira </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">does not know much; he knows only about three hells and I know about seven." And </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">naturally people were impressed. Mahavira talks only of three hells and he talks about </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">seven! </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">One great master was Sanjay Belattiputta, another contemporary of Buddha. He must </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">have been a man something like me -- nonserious. He started talking about seven </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">hundred hells. He said, "What is this Gosalak talking about? -- only seven? There are </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">seven hundred, and there are seven hundred heavens too." </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">He was joking, but people were very interested. This seems to be the right man, who </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">has gone so deep into occultism. </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">Once a follower of Radhaswami, a small sect which is confined to an area near Agra, </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">came to see me. I was in Agra. He was some kind of a priest, and he said, "Do you </div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">know? -- our master has said there are fourteen planes of existence." </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">I said, "Just fourteen?" </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">He said, "What do you mean, 'Just fourteen'? Are there more?" </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">I said, "Certainly." </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">He said, "But our master has said there are only fourteen. Mohammed has reached only </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">up to the third," he said -- he had brought a map -- "Kabir and Nanak have reached up </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">to the fifth. And Mahavira and Buddha up to the seventh," and so on, so forth. But there </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">has never been another who has reached up to the fourteenth except his so-called </div>
<div id="ts_120" class="t s1_120">master. </div>
<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">I said, "I know your master. I have seen him struggling in the fourteenth. He is trying </div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">hard, but he cannot get out of it. I know it because I exist at the fifteenth. There are </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">fifteen planes of existence." </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">He said, "But you are the first man</div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">....</div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">" And he was much impressed. When he was </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">leaving he touched my feet and he said, "You have revealed a new secret." </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">I said, "Don't be foolish. I was just joking! There are only two categories of people: the </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">people who are not aware and the people who are aware. The people who are aware </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">have no hierarchy that one is more aware than the other, that somebody is at the fifth, </div>
<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">somebody at the seventh, somebody at the ninth, somebody at the fourteenth. There is </div>
<div id="t14_120" class="t s1_120">no higher and lower in awareness. Awareness is simply awareness." </div>
<div id="t15_120" class="t s1_120">But he was not much interested in that. He was more interested in my being on the </div>
<div id="t16_120" class="t s1_120">fifteenth plane. </div>
<div id="t17_120" class="t s1_120">People are interested in religious fictions. </div>
