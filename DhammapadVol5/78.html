<div id="t5_78" class="t s1_78">In Russia there were not many rich people. It was almost like India; very few rich </div>
<div id="t6_78" class="t s1_78">people, and ninety-eight percent poor people. But poor people have their own </div>
<div id="t7_78" class="t s1_78">attachments -- more so because they don't have much -- a small piece of land, an old </div>
<div id="t8_78" class="t s1_78">cow, a bullock cart, a few hens. And they are very much afraid because this is all they </div>
<div id="t9_78" class="t s1_78">have. </div>
<div id="ta_78" class="t s1_78">There is a story told: </div>
<div id="tb_78" class="t s1_78">A communist was asking a farmer, "Do you believe in communism or not?" </div>
<div id="tc_78" class="t s1_78">He said, "Yes, I believe in communism!" </div>
<div id="td_78" class="t s1_78">The communist leader asked, "If you had two cars, would you give one to somebody </div>

<div id="ti_78" class="t s1_78">He said, "Absolutely!" </div>
<div id="tj_78" class="t s1_78">And then the communist leader asked, "If you had two cows, would you give one to the </div>
<div id="tk_78" class="t s1_78">person who had none?" </div>
<div id="tl_78" class="t s1_78">He said, "No, absolutely no!" </div>
<div id="tm_78" class="t s1_78">The communist leader said, "But this seems to be absurd -- up to now you are saying, </div>
<div id="tn_78" class="t s1_78">'Yes, yes, yes!' Why suddenly no?" </div>
<div id="to_78" class="t s1_78">He said, "I don't have two cars, I don't have two houses -- but I have two cows!" </div>

<div id="tr_78" class="t s1_78">when it comes to real problems then it is difficult. </div>

<div id="tt_78" class="t s1_78">am killing so many people." And the communist ideology was also a good </div>
<div id="tu_78" class="t s1_78">rationalization for him, because communism believes there is no soul: consciousness is </div>
<div id="tv_78" class="t s1_78">only a by-product of matter, an epiphenomenon. So when you kill a person you are not </div>
<div id="tw_78" class="t s1_78">killing anybody -- there is nobody inside; a man is just matter. </div>
<div id="tx_78" class="t s1_78">This was a great help for the murderer, Joseph Stalin. If there is nobody inside, you are </div>
<div id="ty_78" class="t s1_78">not committing any crime, and when YOU die YOU will die: there is not going to be </div>
<div id="tz_78" class="t s1_78">any afterlife and there is not going to be any Judgment Day. </div>
<div id="t10_78" class="t s1_78">People can create philosophies, rationalizations, arguments, for doing all kinds of </div>
