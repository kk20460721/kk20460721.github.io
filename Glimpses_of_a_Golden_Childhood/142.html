<div id="t3_142" class="t s2_142">opening and you could change gear. You could go to the English school; you could join the middle</div>
<div id="t4_142" class="t s2_142">school as it was called.</div>
<div id="t5_142" class="t s2_142">Again, it was a four-year course, and if you continued in that line then three years later you became</div>
<div id="t6_142" class="t s2_142">a matriculate.</div>
<div id="t7_142" class="t s2_142">My God!</div>
<div id="t8_142" class="t s2_142">What a wastage of life!</div>
<div id="t9_142" class="t s2_142">All those beautiful days wasted so mercilessly,</div>
<div id="ta_142" class="t s2_142">crushed!</div>
<div id="tb_142" class="t s2_142">And by the time you were a matriculate, you were then capable of going to university.</div>
<div id="tc_142" class="t s2_142">Again, it was a six-year course! In all, I had to waste four years in primary school, four years in</div>
<div id="td_142" class="t s2_142">middle school, three years in high school, and six years in university – seventeen years of my life!</div>
<div id="te_142" class="t s2_142">I think, if I can make any sense out of it, the only word that comes to me, in spite of Beelzebub and his</div>
<div id="tf_142" class="t s2_142">disciples doing great work – ex-disciples, I mean – the only word that comes to me is ”nonsense.”</div>
<div id="tg_142" class="t s2_142">Seventeen years!</div>
<div id="th_142" class="t s2_142">And I was eight or nine when I started this whole nonsense, so the day I left</div>
<div id="ti_142" class="t s2_142">university I was twenty-six, and so happy – not because I was a gold medallist but because I was</div>
<div id="tj_142" class="t s2_142">free at last. Free again.</div>
<div id="tk_142" class="t s2_142">I was in such a hurry that I told my professor, ”Don’t waste my time. Nobody can convince me to</div>
<div id="tl_142" class="t s2_142">enter these gates again.</div>
<div id="tm_142" class="t s2_142">Even when I was nine years old my father had to drag me in, but now</div>
<div id="tn_142" class="t s2_142">nobody can drag me. If anyone tries then I will drag him out.” And of course I was able to drag the</div>
<div id="to_142" class="t s2_142">poor old man who was trying to persuade me not to leave.</div>
<div id="tp_142" class="t s2_142">He said, ”Listen to me: it is rare to receive a scholarship for a Ph.D. Do your Ph.D., and I promise</div>
<div id="tq_142" class="t s2_142">you that you will one day be able to have a D.Litt.”</div>
<div id="tr_142" class="t s2_142">I said, ”Don’t waste my time, because my bus is leaving.” The bus was standing there at the gate.</div>
<div id="ts_142" class="t s2_142">I had to rush to catch it, and I am sorry that I could not even thank him. I had no time – the bus</div>
<div id="tt_142" class="t s2_142">was leaving, and my luggage was already on it, and the driver – as drivers do – was honking like</div>
<div id="tu_142" class="t s2_142">mad. I was the only passenger not yet on the bus, and my old professor was almost on his knees</div>
<div id="tv_142" class="t s2_142">persuading me not to leave.</div>
<div id="tw_142" class="t s2_142">Shambhu Babu was well-educated. I was uneducated when the friendship began. He had a glorious</div>
<div id="tx_142" class="t s2_142">past; I had none. The whole town was shocked by our friendship, but he was not even embarrassed.</div>
<div id="ty_142" class="t s2_142">I respect that quality. We used to walk hand in hand. He was my father’s age, and his children were</div>
<div id="tz_142" class="t s2_142">older than me. He died ten years before my father. I think he must have been about ﬁfty at that time.</div>
<div id="t10_142" class="t s2_142">This would have been the right time for us to be friends. But he was the only man to recognize me.</div>
<div id="t11_142" class="t s2_142">He was a man of authority in the village, and his recognition was of immense help to me.</div>
<div id="t12_142" class="t s2_142">Kantar Master was never seen at the school again. He was immediately sent on leave, because</div>
<div id="t13_142" class="t s2_142">there was only one month before his retirement, and his application for an extension had been</div>
<div id="t14_142" class="t s2_142">canceled. This created a great celebration in the village. Kantar Master had been a great man in</div>
<div id="t15_142" class="t s2_142">that village, yet I had had him thrown out in just a single day. That was something. People started</div>
<div id="t16_142" class="t s2_142">respecting me. I would say, ”What nonsense is this? I have not done anything – I simply brought the</div>
<div id="t17_142" class="t s2_142">man and his wrongdoing to the light.”</div>
<div id="t18_142" class="t s2_142">I am surprised how he continued torturing small children his whole life; but that is what was thought</div>
<div id="t19_142" class="t s2_142">to be education. It was thought then, and many Indians still think, that unless you torture a child he</div>
<div id="t1a_142" class="t s2_142">cannot be taught – although they may not say so clearly.</div>
<div id="t1b_142" class="t s2_142">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t1c_142" class="t s2_142">142</div>
