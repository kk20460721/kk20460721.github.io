<div id="t1_53" class="t s1_53">Just in a split second, the mystic took the bag in his hand and ran away. The rich </div>
<div id="t2_53" class="t s1_53">man could not believe for a second what had happened. When he gathered his </div>
<div id="t3_53" class="t s1_53">mind he ran away screaming and crying -- "I have been robbed!" </div>
<div id="t4_53" class="t s1_53">Of course, the mystic knew the way in the village, and he could run fast. And he </div>
<div id="t5_53" class="t s1_53">was a fakir, a strong man, and the rich man had never in his life run after </div>
<div id="t6_53" class="t s1_53">somebody. So, weeping, crying, suffering... and the whole village gathered, and </div>
<div id="t7_53" class="t s1_53">people said, "We had told you before,'Don't go; he's eccentric. Nobody knows </div>
<div id="t8_53" class="t s1_53">what he will do.'" And the whole village became excited. It was a real suffering </div>
<div id="t9_53" class="t s1_53">for the rich man. His whole life's earnings lost -- and to no avail. </div>
<div id="ta_53" class="t s1_53">Running around the whole town, the mystic came back to the same tree where </div>
<div id="tb_53" class="t s1_53">the horse was still standing. He put the bag near the horse, sat under the tree, </div>
<div id="tc_53" class="t s1_53">closed his eyes, became silent. Came the rich man -- running, breathing hard, </div>
<div id="td_53" class="t s1_53">perspiring, tears flowing -- his whole life was at stake. Then he suddenly saw the </div>
<div id="te_53" class="t s1_53">bag near the horse; he took it to his heart, started dancing, became so happy</div>
<div id="tf_53" class="t s1_53">....</div>
<div id="tg_53" class="t s1_53">The mystic opened his eyes and said, "Look! Have I not shown you what </div>
<div id="th_53" class="t s1_53">happiness is?" </div>
<div id="ti_53" class="t s1_53">You have to know suffering; only then you know what happiness is. You need </div>
<div id="tj_53" class="t s1_53">background. Every experience is an experience against a background. A Buddha </div>
<div id="tk_53" class="t s1_53">has to come to the world to feel that he is a Buddha. You have to come into the </div>
<div id="tl_53" class="t s1_53">world and suffer to know who you are. Without it there is no possibility. You are </div>
<div id="tm_53" class="t s1_53">in the same state the rich man was in: running around the mystic, everything </div>
<div id="tn_53" class="t s1_53">robbed, crying and weeping. I can see: everything robbed, you are running in </div>
<div id="to_53" class="t s1_53">this village of the world. The paths are not known, but you are robbed. You are </div>
<div id="tp_53" class="t s1_53">unhappy to the very core, miserable. Running, running, running... one day you </div>
<div id="tq_53" class="t s1_53">will come back to the tree, you will find the bag again. You will dance; you will </div>
<div id="tr_53" class="t s1_53">be ecstatic. You will say, "Now I know what happiness is." </div>
<div id="ts_53" class="t s1_53">The world is a necessary experience. It is a school. One has to pass through it. To </div>
<div id="tt_53" class="t s1_53">know oneself one has to lose oneself first. There is no other way; that's the only </div>
<div id="tu_53" class="t s1_53">way. Nothing can be done about it. That is that. </div>
<div id="tv_53" class="t s1_53">Yes, that's why. Because you are Buddhas, that's why you suffer. Because you are </div>
<div id="tw_53" class="t s1_53">Buddhas, that's why you have fallen in unawareness. You can go back home any </div>
<div id="tx_53" class="t s1_53">day. It is for you; you have to decide and return back to the source. </div>
<div id="ty_53" class="t s1_53">In Christianity one word has been very much misunderstood, and that is </div>
<div id="tz_53" class="t s1_53">"repent." The original Hebrew word for "repent" means return, not repent. That </div>
<div id="t10_53" class="t s1_53">is the only repentance -- if you return! But just by being translated as "repent" the </div>
<div id="t11_53" class="t s1_53">whole thing is lost. Mohammedans have a similar word, toba. Toba means </div>
<div id="t12_53" class="t s1_53">return. It means "go back to the source." Toba also looks like repentance; that too </div>
<div id="t13_53" class="t s1_53">is not repentance. Jains have a word: they call it pratikraman; that means return. </div>
<div id="t14_53" class="t s1_53">The whole point is how to go back to the source from where you have come. And </div>
<div id="t15_53" class="t s1_53">that's all meditation is about: to return, to come back to the source and fall into it </div>
<div id="t16_53" class="t s1_53">again. You are Buddhas, you have been Buddhas, you will remain Buddhas -- </div>
<div id="t17_53" class="t s1_53">but Buddhahood has three stages: one, before you have lost it. the childhood of a </div>
<div id="t18_53" class="t s1_53">Buddha; then, you search for it, the youth of a Buddha; then, you attain it, the old </div>
