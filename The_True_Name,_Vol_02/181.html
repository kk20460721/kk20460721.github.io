<div id="t1_181" class="t s1_181">CHAPTER 10. PATIENCE IS THE GOLDSMITH</div>
<div id="t2_181" class="t s2_181">Zen fakirs say: ”If you want to go to the house of God, you must learn the burglar’s art.” You need</div>
<div id="t3_181" class="t s2_181">as much alertness as the thief uses. You also must transform your fear and enter like the thief, as if</div>
<div id="t4_181" class="t s2_181">it is your own house.</div>
<div id="t5_181" class="t s2_181">There is a Zen story: There was a very well known thief who was considered number one in the</div>
<div id="t6_181" class="t s2_181">hierarchy of thieves.</div>
<div id="t7_181" class="t s2_181">He was so adept at his art that he had never been caught, yet everyone knew he was a thief. The</div>
<div id="t8_181" class="t s2_181">news even reached the ears of the king who called him, and honored him for his wonderful efﬁciency</div>
<div id="t9_181" class="t s2_181">and skill.</div>
<div id="ta_181" class="t s2_181">As he became older his son said to him, ”Father, it is time for you to teach me your art, because who</div>
<div id="tb_181" class="t s2_181">knows when death may come?’</div>
<div id="tc_181" class="t s2_181">The thief replied, ”If you wish to learn I shall teach you. Come with me tomorrow night.”</div>
<div id="td_181" class="t s2_181">The next night both father and son set out.</div>
<div id="te_181" class="t s2_181">The father broke through the wall as the son stood</div>
<div id="tf_181" class="t s2_181">watching. His absorption in breaking in would have put any artist to shame. He was lost in his work</div>
<div id="tg_181" class="t s2_181">as if he were lost in prayer. The son was awed by his father’s proﬁciency. He was a master thief, the</div>
<div id="th_181" class="t s2_181">guru of so many thieves.</div>
<div id="ti_181" class="t s2_181">The son was trembling from head to foot, though it was a warm night. Fear arose again and again,</div>
<div id="tj_181" class="t s2_181">chilling his spine. His eyes darted everywhere, watching all directions, but his father was lost in his</div>
<div id="tk_181" class="t s2_181">work and didn’t lift his eyes even once. When they entered through the hole the son was trembling</div>
<div id="tl_181" class="t s2_181">like a leaf; never had he felt so afraid in all his life, but the father moved about as though the place</div>
<div id="tm_181" class="t s2_181">belonged to him. He took the son in, broke the locks, opened the lock of a huge wardrobe ﬁlled with</div>
<div id="tn_181" class="t s2_181">clothes and jewels, and told the son to get inside.</div>
<div id="to_181" class="t s2_181">No sooner did the son enter but the father closed the cupboard, locked it, and taking the key with</div>
<div id="tp_181" class="t s2_181">him, left the house shouting, ”Thief, thief!” and returned home. By then everyone had awakened.</div>
<div id="tq_181" class="t s2_181">The son was caught in the worst dilemma of his life. What was he to do? He was worried about the</div>
<div id="tr_181" class="t s2_181">footprints and the hole in the wall. At that moment the servant come right up to the wardrobe. The</div>
<div id="ts_181" class="t s2_181">poor boy was at his wits end, his mind completely blank. At such a time the mind does not work,</div>
<div id="tt_181" class="t s2_181">because it is full of stale knowledge and doesn’t know how to deal with fresh situations. He had</div>
<div id="tu_181" class="t s2_181">never heard of such a thing arising in the whole history of thieving. His intellect became useless.</div>
<div id="tv_181" class="t s2_181">At the moment the intellect became useless, the consciousness within was awakened. Suddenly, as</div>
<div id="tw_181" class="t s2_181">this energy caught him, he began making a noise as if a rat was gnawing at the clothes inside the</div>
<div id="tx_181" class="t s2_181">cupboard. He was shocked at himself; he had never done such a thing before. The woman servant</div>
<div id="ty_181" class="t s2_181">brought a bunch of keys and opened it. He immediately puffed out the lamp she was holding and,</div>
<div id="tz_181" class="t s2_181">giving her a push, ran out of the house through the hole in the wall. Some ten or twenty people gave</div>
<div id="t10_181" class="t s2_181">chase. There was a great deal of noise, because the whole village was awake. The thief ran for his</div>
<div id="t11_181" class="t s2_181">life – ran as he had never run before. He had no idea it was he who was running. Suddenly, as he</div>
<div id="t12_181" class="t s2_181">reached a well, he picked up a big stone and threw it in the well – all this without the slightest idea</div>
<div id="t13_181" class="t s2_181">of what he was doing. It seemed to him it was not he but someone else directing him. At the sound</div>
<div id="t14_181" class="t s2_181">of the stone falling in the water the crowd gathered around the well, thinking the thief had fallen in.</div>
<div id="t15_181" class="t s2_181">The True Name, Vol 2</div>
