<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">There is only one thing which you can take with you, and that is true wealth. Buddha </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">calls it meditation, awareness, watchfulness, mindfulness, consciousness. If you become </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">more and more conscious, you can take that consciousness with you. But you are living </div>
<div id="t7_8" class="t s1_8">a very very unconscious life. Your whole life is mechanical, you simply go on repeating. </div>
<div id="t8_8" class="t s1_8">You are not really living, you are being lived by unconscious desires. </div>
<div id="t9_8" class="t s1_8">Buddha says: Meditation is the only wealth, because you can take it beyond death. In </div>
<div id="ta_8" class="t s1_8">fact he says this is the criterion: if something can be taken beyond death it is true </div>

<div id="td_8" class="t s1_8">knock at your door, you will weep, you will cry, but then nothing can be done. </div>
<div id="te_8" class="t s1_8">It is said of Alexander the Great that when he was dying, tears were rolling down his </div>
<div id="tf_8" class="t s1_8">cheeks, because the physicians had told him that he had only twenty-four hours at the </div>
<div id="tg_8" class="t s1_8">most; his death was absolutely certain within twenty-four hours. His physician asked, </div>
<div id="th_8" class="t s1_8">"Why are you crying? You are a brave man." </div>
<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">Alexander said, "I had promised my mother that I would come back home. In twenty-</div>

<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">give my whole kingdom to you if you can manage twenty-four hours more for me. I </div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">would like to fulfill my promise. I have given my word, and my mother will be waiting </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">for me." </div>
<div id="tn_8" class="t s1_8">The physician said, "It is impossible. Nothing can be done. In fact twenty-four hours is </div>
<div id="to_8" class="t s1_8">also too optimistic a hope. As I see it, things are going down the drain. Within two or </div>
<div id="tp_8" class="t s1_8">three hours you will be gone. Twenty-four hours is the most, more than that is not </div>
<div id="tq_8" class="t s1_8">possible." </div>
<div id="tr_8" class="t s1_8">And Alexander died within six hours. Before he died, he asked for one thing only. </div>
<div id="ts_8" class="t s1_8">He said, "When you take me towards the cemetery, let my hands hang outside the </div>
<div id="tt_8" class="t s1_8">casket." </div>
<div id="tu_8" class="t s1_8">"Why?" asked his generals. "It has never been done, it is not conventional. Why this </div>
<div id="tv_8" class="t s1_8">eccentric idea?" </div>
<div id="tw_8" class="t s1_8">Alexander said, "For a simple reason. I would like people to know that I am going </div>

<div id="t10_8" class="t s1_8">Death is so powerful, but one thing it cannot take away from you, that is meditation. If </div>

<div id="t12_8" class="t s1_8">are not the body, and you are not the mind, and you are not the heart. You are simply </div>
<div id="t13_8" class="t s1_8">the witnessing soul, and that witnessing will go with you. Then you can witness even </div>
<div id="t14_8" class="t s1_8">death. That witnessing is the source of all religion. Those who have attained to that </div>
