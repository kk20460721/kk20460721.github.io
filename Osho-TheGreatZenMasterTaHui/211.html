<div id="t1_211" class="t s1_211">existence into wordlessness. All sounds become silent ... all separations disappear ... even the</div>
<div id="t2_211" class="t s1_211">separation between the master and the disciple is no more there. The whole series is</div>
<div id="t3_211" class="t s1_211">significant in the sense that it will show you the path in different stages.</div>
<div id="t4_211" class="t s1_211">Most people who are enlightened speak only after their enlightenment. There is a great</div>
<div id="t5_211" class="t s1_211">distance between you and them -- they are on a high, sunlit mountain peak, and you are in the</div>
<div id="t6_211" class="t s1_211">dark valleys of your life. The distance is so much that to expect any understanding arising</div>
<div id="t7_211" class="t s1_211">between you becomes very difficult.</div>
<div id="t8_211" class="t s1_211">But with Ta Hui your dialogue starts when he himself is in the dark valley, and the</div>
<div id="t9_211" class="t s1_211">dialogue continues as he goes on climbing the mountain. Still there is something to be</div>
<div id="ta_211" class="t s1_211">climbed, but it is becoming more and more certain that he will be able to make it. He has</div>
<div id="tb_211" class="t s1_211">reached very close.</div>
<div id="tc_211" class="t s1_211">Because the dialogue with him has started while he was just one of you, that continuity</div>
<div id="td_211" class="t s1_211">and the slow change in his being can be of great importance for understanding not only him,</div>
<div id="te_211" class="t s1_211">but your own journey.</div>
<div id="tf_211" class="t s1_211">Perhaps the emperor of China met him when he was enlightened. and that's why he gave</div>
<div id="tg_211" class="t s1_211">him the honorable title, "The Great Master of Zen." We have to see whether he makes it or</div>
<div id="th_211" class="t s1_211">goes astray ... because one can go astray at the very last moment. He has just to go one step</div>
<div id="ti_211" class="t s1_211">more, and something -- some idea, some accident, some incident -- can take him away.</div>
<div id="tj_211" class="t s1_211">There is an old saying in the East that people don't get lost until they have almost reached.</div>
<div id="tk_211" class="t s1_211">It is a very strange saying, but it has great psychological insight behind it. As people start</div>
<div id="tl_211" class="t s1_211">feeling they are reaching, they start losing the awareness that is needed to take the final jump.</div>
<div id="tm_211" class="t s1_211">They start thinking, "Now it is almost certain I will reach, it is only a question of a few steps</div>
<div id="tn_211" class="t s1_211">more ..." Even one step is enough to take you astray, if you become certain. If you remain</div>
<div id="to_211" class="t s1_211">open, vulnerable, aware that you can still miss it, then there is less possibility of missing it.</div>
<div id="tp_211" class="t s1_211">It is well known to travelers that when they come close to their goal, they start feeling</div>
<div id="tq_211" class="t s1_211">utterly tired -- just before the goal. They have been traveling thousands of miles, but they had</div>
<div id="tr_211" class="t s1_211">never felt so tired. And because now they can see the goal has almost been reached, there is no</div>
<div id="ts_211" class="t s1_211">hurry; they can sit down, they can rest -- and that is a very dangerous situation.</div>
<div id="tt_211" class="t s1_211">The inner journey is such that you cannot rest and wait, because the goal is not something</div>
<div id="tu_211" class="t s1_211">dead, an objective that will remain there.</div>
<div id="tv_211" class="t s1_211">Even if you are resting outside the temple of your ultimate realization, you can fall asleep</div>
<div id="tw_211" class="t s1_211">again. The old habit ... and habits die hard -- they can overwhelm you. And if the old sleep</div>
<div id="tx_211" class="t s1_211">comes in the name of tiredness, saying "You can rest now that you have already arrived;</div>
<div id="ty_211" class="t s1_211">tomorrow morning you can enter into the temple. There is no hurry now" ... Up to now it was</div>
<div id="tz_211" class="t s1_211">always a hurry, but because you have almost made it, you can rest, you can fall into a deep</div>
<div id="t10_211" class="t s1_211">sleep ... and your sleep can take you so far astray that when you open your eyes, the temple is</div>
<div id="t11_211" class="t s1_211">no longer there.</div>
<div id="t12_211" class="t s1_211">So we have to see the whole process of evolution from a student to a disciple, to a devotee,</div>
<div id="t13_211" class="t s1_211">to a master -- from just intellectual effort to understanding what enlightenment is, and then to</div>
<div id="t14_211" class="t s1_211">experience it in one's own being.</div>
<div id="t15_211" class="t s1_211">Ta Hui can be of more help to you than anybody else, because all the enlightened people</div>
<div id="t16_211" class="t s1_211">are recorded only after their enlightenment. Ta Hui is an exception. Because he was a great</div>
<div id="t17_211" class="t s1_211">teacher, very articulate, the disciples started thinking that he was already enlightened and they</div>
<div id="t18_211" class="t s1_211">began collecting his sutras.</div>
<div id="t19_211" class="t s1_211">Chapter 17 - No goal</div>
<div id="t1a_211" class="t s1_211">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t1b_211" class="t s1_211">211</div>
