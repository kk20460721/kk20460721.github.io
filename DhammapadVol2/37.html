<div id="t1_37" class="t s1_37">Stupid people ask about God, the intelligent person asks about death. The people who </div>
<div id="t2_37" class="t s1_37">go on asking about God never find God, and the person who asks about death is bound </div>
<div id="t3_37" class="t s1_37">to find God -- because it is death that transforms you, your vision. Your consciousness </div>
<div id="t4_37" class="t s1_37">is sharpened because you have raised a real question, an authentic question, the most </div>
<div id="t5_37" class="t s1_37">important question of life. You have created such a great challenge that you can't </div>
<div id="t6_37" class="t s1_37">remain asleep for long; you will have to be awake, you will have to be alert enough to </div>
<div id="t7_37" class="t s1_37">encounter the reality of death. </div>
<div id="t8_37" class="t s1_37">That's how Buddha's inquiry began: </div>
<div id="t9_37" class="t s1_37">The day Buddha was born...he was the son of a great king, and the only son, and he was </div>
<div id="ta_37" class="t s1_37">born when the king was getting old, very old; hence there was great rejoicing in the </div>
<div id="tb_37" class="t s1_37">kingdom. The people had waited long. The king was very much loved by the people; he </div>
<div id="tc_37" class="t s1_37">had served them, he had been kind and compassionate, he had been very loving and </div>
<div id="td_37" class="t s1_37">very sharing. He had made his kingdom one of the richest, loveliest kingdoms of those </div>
<div id="te_37" class="t s1_37">days. </div>
<div id="tf_37" class="t s1_37">People were praying that their king should have a son because there was nobody to </div>
<div id="tg_37" class="t s1_37">inherit. And then Buddha was born in the king's very old age -- unexpected was his </div>
<div id="th_37" class="t s1_37">birth. Great celebration, great rejoicing! All the astrologers of the kingdom gathered to </div>
<div id="ti_37" class="t s1_37">predict about Buddha. His name was Siddhartha -- he was given this name, Siddhartha, </div>
<div id="tj_37" class="t s1_37">because it means fulfillment. The king was fulfilled, his desire was fulfilled, his deepest </div>
<div id="tk_37" class="t s1_37">longing was fulfilled -- he wanted a son, he had wanted a son his whole life; hence the </div>
<div id="tl_37" class="t s1_37">name Siddhartha. It simply means fulfillment of the deepest desire. </div>
<div id="tm_37" class="t s1_37">This son made the king's life meaningful, significant. The astrologers, great astrologers, </div>
<div id="tn_37" class="t s1_37">predicted -- they were all agreeing except one young astrologer. His name was </div>
<div id="to_37" class="t s1_37">Kodanna. The king asked, "What is going to happen in the life of my son?" And all the </div>
<div id="tp_37" class="t s1_37">astrologers raised two fingers, except Kodanna who raised only one finger. </div>
<div id="tq_37" class="t s1_37">The king asked, "Please don't talk in symbols -- I am a simple man, I don't know </div>
<div id="tr_37" class="t s1_37">anything about astrology. Tell me, what do you mean by two fingers?" </div>
<div id="ts_37" class="t s1_37">And they all said, "Either he is going to become a CHAKRAVARTIN -- a world ruler -- </div>
<div id="tt_37" class="t s1_37">or he will renounce the world and will become a buddha, an enlightened person. These </div>
<div id="tu_37" class="t s1_37">two alternatives are there, hence we raise two fingers." </div>
<div id="tv_37" class="t s1_37">The king was worried about the second alternative, that he will renounce the world. "So </div>
<div id="tw_37" class="t s1_37">again the problem: who will inherit my kingdom if he renounces the world?" And then </div>
<div id="tx_37" class="t s1_37">he asked Kodanna, "Why do you raise only one finger?" </div>
<div id="ty_37" class="t s1_37">Kodanna said, "I am absolutely certain that he will renounce the world -- he will </div>
<div id="tz_37" class="t s1_37">become a buddha, an enlightened one, an awakened one." </div>
<div id="t10_37" class="t s1_37">The king was not happy with Kodanna. Truth is very difficult to accept. He ignored </div>
<div id="t11_37" class="t s1_37">Kodanna; Kodanna was not rewarded at all -- truth is not rewarded in this world. On </div>
<div id="t12_37" class="t s1_37">the contrary, truth is punished in a thousand and one ways. In fact, Kodanna's prestige </div>
<div id="t13_37" class="t s1_37">fell after that day. Because he was not rewarded by the king, the rumor spread that he </div>
<div id="t14_37" class="t s1_37">was a fool. When all the astrologers were agreeing, he was the only one who was not </div>
<div id="t15_37" class="t s1_37">agreeing. </div>
