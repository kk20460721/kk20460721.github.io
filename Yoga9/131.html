<div id="t3_131" class="t s1_131">created a certain home: in the tradition, in the country, in the history, in the heroes -- </div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s1_131">Ram, Krishna -- now one feels at home. One has found his place, but that is not a real </div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s1_131">place. This identity is utilitarian. </div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s1_131">And then this habit becomes so solid that even one day you come to know what nonsense </div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s1_131">it is that you think you are Indian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, Chinese -- what </div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s1_131">nonsense -- but then too the old habit will persist. </div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s1_131">Bertrand Russell has written that he knows that he is no longer a Christian, but somehow </div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s1_131">he goes on forgetting it again and again. The whole conditioning</div>

<div id="tc_131" class="t s1_131">You may go against </div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s1_131">the tradition, but still you will cling to it. Even people who become revolutionaries </div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s1_131">remain attached to their traditions; maybe in a negative way. If a Hindu goes against </div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s1_131">Hinduism, he will still talk about Krishna -- against him; he will still talk about Rama -- </div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s1_131">against him. If a Mohammedan goes against his tradition, he will still be criticizing the </div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s1_131">Koran; of course criticizing now, criticizing Mohammed, but he remains attached to the </div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s1_131">tradition. </div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s1_131">A real rebel is one who drops the tradition so deeply, so utterly, that he is not even </div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s1_131">against it. He is neither for nor against; then one is free. If you are against, you are still </div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s1_131">not free. If you are against anything, you will find you are bound with that thing; there is </div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s1_131">a tie. </div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s1_131">And habits become unconscious. I know a very, very learned man, very scholarly, very </div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s1_131">famous, and really a great intellectual. He has been a follower of J. Krishnamurti for </div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s1_131">long, almost forty years. And whenever he will come to see me, he will again and again </div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s1_131">say, "There is no meditation. What are you teaching to people? Krishnamurti says there is </div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s1_131">no meditation; all mantras are just repetitive; and all meditations, all methods, condition </div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s1_131">the mind. And I don't meditate." </div>

<div id="t12_131" class="t s1_131">wrong. And there is no loss in just repeating Ram, Ram, Ram; and it is very consoling." </div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s1_131">What happened to this man? Forty years of listening to Krishnamurti, but his Hindu is </div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s1_131">there. At the last moment the mind will start reacting. No, he is not a rebel. He was </div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s1_131">thinking he is a rebel. He has been fighting everything, he has been against all that </div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s1_131">Hindus say, and in the last moment the whole edifice falls. </div>
<div id="t17_131" class="t s1_131">Life ordinarily is nothing but a habit, a mechanical habit. Unless you become aware, </div>
<div id="t18_131" class="t s1_131">unless you become really aware, it will be difficult to get out of it. </div>
<div id="t19_131" class="t s1_131">I have heard about a gambler. </div>
<div id="t1a_131" class="t s1_131">An inveterate gambler died, and his ghost wandered around disconsolately for several </div>
<div id="t1b_131" class="t s1_131">weeks. Although he was entitled to be admitted to heaven, he found himself bored by the </div>
<div id="t1c_131" class="t s1_131">place. No gambling, no gamblers -- what is the use of going to paradise or heaven ? </div>
<div id="t1d_131" class="t s1_131">Eventually he asked St. Peter if he could go and take a look at the other place. </div>
<div id="t1e_131" class="t s1_131">"I'm afraid that is impossible," said St. Peter. "If you go down there, you won't be </div>
<div id="t1f_131" class="t s1_131">allowed back." </div>
