<div id="t1_40" class="t s1_40">It is so. It is very difficult to know something without losing it, because when </div>
<div id="t2_40" class="t s1_40">you have not lost it you are so totally one with it. There is no distance: the </div>
<div id="t3_40" class="t s1_40">observer and the observed are one; the known and the knower are one. Every </div>
<div id="t4_40" class="t s1_40">child is in a profoundly blissful state. </div>
<div id="t5_40" class="t s1_40">Psychologists also agree with this. They say that the whole search of religion is </div>
<div id="t6_40" class="t s1_40">nothing but a way to again find the womb of the mother. They use it as a </div>
<div id="t7_40" class="t s1_40">criticism of religion, but to me it is not criticism at all. It is simply true. Yes, the </div>
<div id="t8_40" class="t s1_40">search for religion is again a search for the womb. The search for religion is again </div>
<div id="t9_40" class="t s1_40">a search to make this whole existence a womb. </div>
<div id="ta_40" class="t s1_40">The child is in absolute tune with the mother. The child is never out of tune with </div>
<div id="tb_40" class="t s1_40">the mother. The child does not know that he is separate from the mother. If the </div>

<div id="te_40" class="t s1_40">mother is dancing the child is dancing; if the mother is sitting silently the child is </div>
<div id="tf_40" class="t s1_40">silent. The child has no boundaries of his own yet. This is the purest bliss, but it </div>
<div id="tg_40" class="t s1_40">has to be lost. </div>
<div id="th_40" class="t s1_40">The child is born, and suddenly he is thrown off-center. Suddenly he is uprooted </div>
<div id="ti_40" class="t s1_40">from the earth, from the mother. He loses his moorings and he does not know </div>
<div id="tj_40" class="t s1_40">who he is. There was no need to know it when he was with the mother. There </div>
<div id="tk_40" class="t s1_40">was no.need to know -- he was all, and there was no need to know, there was no </div>
<div id="tl_40" class="t s1_40">distinction. There was no 'you', so there was no question of 'I' The reality was </div>
<div id="tm_40" class="t s1_40">undivided. It was ADWAITA, pure ADWAITA, pure non-duality. </div>
<div id="tn_40" class="t s1_40">But once the child is born, the umbilical cord is cut and he starts breathing on his </div>
<div id="to_40" class="t s1_40">own, suddenly his whole being becomes a quest to know who he is. It is natural. </div>
<div id="tp_40" class="t s1_40">Now he starts becoming aware of his boundaries -- his body, his needs. </div>
<div id="tq_40" class="t s1_40">Sometimes he is happy, sometimes unhappy, sometimes he is fulfilled, </div>
<div id="tr_40" class="t s1_40">sometimes not fulfilled; sometimes he is hungry and crying and there is no sign </div>

<div id="tt_40" class="t s1_40">oneness with the mother. But now there are many moods and many climates, </div>
<div id="tu_40" class="t s1_40">and he will start, by and by, to feel the separation. A divorce has happened; the </div>

<div id="t11_40" class="t s1_40">becomes aware of 'mine'. Watch it, because this is your construction, the </div>
<div id="t12_40" class="t s1_40">structure of your ego. First the child becomes aware of 'mine' -- this toy is mine, </div>
<div id="t13_40" class="t s1_40">this mother is mine. He starts possessing. The possessor enters first; </div>
<div id="t14_40" class="t s1_40">possessiveness is very basic. Hence all the religions say: Become non-possessive -</div>
<div id="t15_40" class="t s1_40">- because with possession starts the hell. Watch small children: very jealous, </div>
<div id="t16_40" class="t s1_40">possessive, each child trying to snatch everything from everybody else and </div>
<div id="t17_40" class="t s1_40">trying to protect his own toys. And you will see children that are very violent, </div>
