<div id="t1_35" class="t s1_35">CHAPTER 3. THE NUCLEAR FAMILY – THE IMMINENT MELTDOWN</div>
<div id="t2_35" class="t s2_35">their reality is something totally different. And they were also afraid because Indira was absolutely</div>
<div id="t3_35" class="t s2_35">incorruptible. That was one thing she had learned from Jawaharlal. He was incorruptible because</div>
<div id="t4_35" class="t s2_35">he was not a politician; he was more a poet.</div>
<div id="t5_35" class="t s2_35">He would have loved to have been a painter or a</div>
<div id="t6_35" class="t s2_35">sculptor, or any art would have been closer to his nature.</div>
<div id="t7_35" class="t s2_35">Politics was just accidental to him, it was almost forced on him – sometimes it happens</div>
<div id="t8_35" class="t s2_35">....</div>
<div id="t9_35" class="t s2_35">Because he was interested in the independence of India, he fought against the British government,</div>
<div id="ta_35" class="t s2_35">but with no idea that he was going to become the prime minister when the country became free. He</div>
<div id="tb_35" class="t s2_35">had never thought about it. He was just a soldier of the freedom movement, as were many thousands</div>
<div id="tc_35" class="t s2_35">of others. He may have been shot, he may have been killed, he may have been sentenced to death</div>
<div id="td_35" class="t s2_35">– anything could have happened. There was no question of power.</div>
<div id="te_35" class="t s2_35">When the ﬁght for freedom was over, then the question arose of who is to be in power? Till then</div>
<div id="tf_35" class="t s2_35">there was no question of power at all. The question was how to remove the invaders. He became</div>
<div id="tg_35" class="t s2_35">interested because he was so sensitive a man that he loved the idea of freedom. It had nothing to</div>
<div id="th_35" class="t s2_35">do with politics; he loved the idea of freedom as a poet. But when freedom came there was a great</div>
<div id="ti_35" class="t s2_35">struggle for who should be the prime minister. There were people like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who</div>
<div id="tj_35" class="t s2_35">was a real politician, a solid politician who could commit any crime. He did commit them when he</div>
<div id="tk_35" class="t s2_35">became deputy prime minister. Even Jawaharlal could not stop him.</div>
<div id="tl_35" class="t s2_35">And there were others, because in the freedom ﬁght there were thousands of people of caliber.</div>
<div id="tm_35" class="t s2_35">Jawaharlal was the only one who was not interested in politics, not interested in power. That’s why</div>
<div id="tn_35" class="t s2_35">Gandhi chose him, because to choose those people who were really interested in power</div>
<div id="to_35" class="t s2_35">....</div>
<div id="tp_35" class="t s2_35">In fact</div>
<div id="tq_35" class="t s2_35">their ﬁght for freedom was not a ﬁght for freedom but just a step to reach power. It was a shock to</div>
<div id="tr_35" class="t s2_35">all the politicians because none of them had been chosen by Gandhi to be the prime minister; and</div>
<div id="ts_35" class="t s2_35">Gandhi had total control of the Indian mind.</div>
<div id="tt_35" class="t s2_35">Sardar Patel was shocked because he was very close to Gandhi and he was also a Gujarati –</div>
<div id="tu_35" class="t s2_35">Gandhi was a Gujarati – and he had served Gandhi his whole life with total trust. And at the last</div>
<div id="tv_35" class="t s2_35">moment Gandhi simply said to Sardar, ”You step down. Don’t ﬁght with Jawaharlal. I will make you</div>
<div id="tw_35" class="t s2_35">deputy prime minister but let Jawaharlal be the prime minister.</div>
<div id="tx_35" class="t s2_35">”Why?” Patel asked.</div>
<div id="ty_35" class="t s2_35">And the reason that Gandhi gave was right. He said, ”He is the only one who is not interested in</div>
<div id="tz_35" class="t s2_35">power. You will all be ﬁghting with each other; he is the only one who is above all of you.”</div>
<div id="t10_35" class="t s2_35">Because Gandhi said, ”Be the prime minister,” Jawaharlal said okay.</div>
<div id="t11_35" class="t s2_35">When Gandhi had said, in</div>
<div id="t12_35" class="t s2_35">1942, ”You be the second soldier in the freedom ﬁght” – the ﬁrst was Vinoba Bhave – he said okay.</div>
<div id="t13_35" class="t s2_35">Vinoba Bhave was not known at all in India up to that time.</div>
<div id="t14_35" class="t s2_35">He was just an inmate in Gandhi’s</div>
<div id="t15_35" class="t s2_35">ashram. He massaged Gandhi, bathed Gandhi, read scriptures to Gandhi, and because he was a</div>
<div id="t16_35" class="t s2_35">Sanskrit scholar, explained to Gandhi what those scriptures meant. But as far as the country was</div>
<div id="t17_35" class="t s2_35">concerned, he was an unknown person. Gandhi chose an anonymous person to be the ﬁrst freedom</div>
<div id="t18_35" class="t s2_35">ﬁghter – that he would go to jail ﬁrst, and the second would be Jawaharlal.</div>
<div id="t19_35" class="t s2_35">From Ignorance to Innocence</div>
