<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">CHAPTER 5. ASTROLOGY: THE SCIENCE OF COSMIC ONENESS</div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s2_91">Astrology is a very scientiﬁc way of thinking. It says that the future will emerge only out of the past:</div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s2_91">your today has emerged from your yesterday; your tomorrow will emerge from your today. Astrology</div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s2_91">also says that whatever will happen tomorrow is in some subtle way present even today. Now try to</div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s2_91">understand a little about this.</div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s2_91">Three days before his assassination, Abraham Lincoln dreamt that he had been murdered and that</div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s2_91">his corpse was lying in a special room in the White House. He even noted the number of his room.</div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s2_91">At that point his sleep was broken, and when he woke up, he laughed. He said to his wife, ”I dreamt</div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s2_91">that I was murdered and that my body was lying in such-and-such-number room, and in such-and-</div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s2_91">such wing of the White House” – he was sleeping in that wing of the White House. ”You stood at my</div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s2_91">head, and such-and-such people were standing all around.”</div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s2_91">It was a joke, a laughing matter to him. Lincoln and his wife went back to sleep. Three days later</div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s2_91">Lincoln’s assassination took place. Three days later his body was lying in that number room, in that</div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s2_91">very place, and in that sequence people were standing around his body.</div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s2_91">If what was to occur three days later had not in some fashion already occurred, then how could such</div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s2_91">a dream have taken place? How could the dream resemble, in such detail, what actually took place?</div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s2_91">Such a glimpse is given in a dream only if in some way it is already implied in the present moment.</div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s2_91">Then only can we get a glimpse of what will take place in the future.</div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s2_91">If we open the window of the present, then we will be able to see that the future is just outside this</div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s2_91">window. It is the thesis of astrology that the future is simply our ignorance – so, it is ”the future.” If we</div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s2_91">were to see, then the future would not be a ”happening” for us – we would know it is already present</div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s2_91">here and now.</div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s2_91">There is reference to one event in Mahavira’s life, over which there has been much dispute. Because</div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s2_91">of this dispute, a group of his disciples broke away from him, in his very presence. Because of this</div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s2_91">dispute, ﬁve hundred of Mahavira’s munis created a separate order.</div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s2_91">Mahavira used to say that</div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s2_91">whatever is happening has in some sense already happened: if you are walking, then in a sense</div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s2_91">you have already arrived at the destination; if you are growing old, then in a sense you have already</div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s2_91">grown old. Mahavira used to say that whatever is happening, whatever is in process, has already</div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s2_91">occurred.</div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s2_91">One senior disciple of Mahavira lived far away from him during the monsoon. He was sick, so he</div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s2_91">asked a junior disciple who was present to spread out a mat for him. The junior disciple began to</div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s2_91">spread out the mat. He had just unfolded the twisted, rolled-up mat a little when the senior disciple</div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s2_91">remembered Mahavira’s saying. He said, ”Stop! Mahavira says that what is happening has already</div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s2_91">happened.” The mat was in the process of being rolled out but it was not yet opened. It had suddenly</div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s2_91">occurred to him that Mahavira had said a very wrong thing. The mat was half-opened, but in what</div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s2_91">sense was it already opened?</div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s2_91">He left the mat there. After the monsoon he went to Mahavira and said, ”You are mistaken when you</div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s2_91">say that what is happening has already happened, because right now the mat is lying half-opened.</div>
<div id="t14_91" class="t s2_91">It was being opened, but it has not been opened.</div>
<div id="t15_91" class="t s2_91">So I have come to prove that your saying is</div>
<div id="t16_91" class="t s2_91">wrong.” Mahavira told him that he had not understood the saying. This disciple must have had a</div>
<div id="t17_91" class="t s2_91">very childish mind; otherwise he would not have come with such talk.</div>
<div id="t18_91" class="t s2_91">Mahavira said, ”You have</div>
<div id="t19_91" class="t s2_91">Hidden Mysteries</div>
<div id="t1a_91" class="t s2_91">91</div>
<div id="t1b_91" class="t s3_91">Osho</div>
