<div id="t2_46" class="t s1_46">give the appearance to all who looked upon his body that he was deceased. The next day </div>
<div id="t3_46" class="t s1_46">the man followed instructions and his body was besieged with the wailings and sobbings </div>
<div id="t4_46" class="t s1_46">of his wife and family. </div>
<div id="t5_46" class="t s1_46">The guru appeared at the door in the guise of a magician and told the family that if they </div>

<div id="t7_46" class="t s1_46">if someone would die in his place by drinking the potion he had. </div>
<div id="t8_46" class="t s1_46">Each member of the family had an excuse that made it necessary to keep his own life, and </div>
<div id="t9_46" class="t s1_46">the wife added, "Anyway, he is already dead; we will manage." </div>
<div id="ta_46" class="t s1_46">At this the yogi stood up and said, "Woman, if you can live-without me then I can go </div>
<div id="tb_46" class="t s1_46">with my guru." He faced the teacher and said, "Let us go, sir, revered Master. I will </div>
<div id="tc_46" class="t s1_46">follow you." </div>
<div id="td_46" class="t s1_46">The whole attachment to the senses is as if you are the senses, as if you cannot live </div>
<div id="te_46" class="t s1_46">without them, as if your whole life is confined to them. But you are not confined to them. </div>
<div id="tf_46" class="t s1_46">You can renounce them, and you can live still, and live on a higher plane. Difficult. Just </div>
<div id="tg_46" class="t s1_46">as if you want to persuade a seed that "Die, and soon a beautiful plant will be born." How </div>

<div id="tm_46" class="t s1_46">outside the womb. The womb has been his whole life; he knows only that much. He is </div>
<div id="tn_46" class="t s1_46">afraid. The same is the situation: surrounded by the senses, we live in a sort of </div>
<div id="to_46" class="t s1_46">confinement, an imprisonment. </div>
<div id="tp_46" class="t s1_46">One has to be a little daring, courageous. Right now, wherever you are and whatsoever </div>
<div id="tq_46" class="t s1_46">you are, nothing is happening to you. Then take the risk. Then move into the unknown. </div>
