<div id="t1_152" class="t s1_152">One day I was walking around a garden and I saw a beggar, with only one shoe on one of </div>
<div id="t2_152" class="t s1_152">his feet. So I asked him, "Poor man, have you lost your other shoe?" He said, "No, I have </div>
<div id="t3_152" class="t s1_152">found one." Be positive. </div>
<div id="t4_152" class="t s1_152">A man undertook to stay the night in a haunted cottage for a bet. In order to ensure that </div>
<div id="t5_152" class="t s1_152">he did not leave the cottage during the night, the front and back doors were locked and </div>
<div id="t6_152" class="t s1_152">the windows sealed. The next morning when the cottage was opened up, there was no </div>
<div id="t7_152" class="t s1_152">sign of the man, but there was a large hole in the roof, and it was obvious that he had </div>
<div id="t8_152" class="t s1_152">made a speedy exit during that night. It was not until two days later that he arrived back </div>
<div id="t9_152" class="t s1_152">in the village. </div>
<div id="ta_152" class="t s1_152">"Where on earth have you been for the past forty-eight hours?" his friends asked. </div>
<div id="tb_152" class="t s1_152">"Coming back," he said. "Coming back!" </div>
<div id="tc_152" class="t s1_152">In fear he must have run so fast that it took forty-eight hours to come back to the same </div>
<div id="td_152" class="t s1_152">village. </div>
<div id="te_152" class="t s1_152">It is good Maitreya that you missed the train; otherwise it would have taken forty-eight </div>
<div id="tf_152" class="t s1_152">lives to come back. </div>
<div id="tg_152" class="t s1_152">And the other part of the question: "And last night I saw you marrying a number of </div>
<div id="th_152" class="t s1_152">women, good ones, together and said to myself that you would manage them with ease </div>
<div id="ti_152" class="t s1_152">and grace." Can't you see that I am managing them with ease and grace? Each disciple is </div>
<div id="tj_152" class="t s1_152">a woman -- man or woman, that doesn't matter -- because a disciple has to be feminine; </div>
<div id="tk_152" class="t s1_152">only then can he learn. There is no other way because a disciple has to be receptive like a </div>
<div id="tl_152" class="t s1_152">womb. He has to receive me so totally... he has to be a passive receptor. </div>
<div id="tm_152" class="t s1_152">In India we have the myth that Krishna had sixteen thousand wives, or girlfriends. It is </div>
<div id="tn_152" class="t s1_152">not right to say "wives," because he was really a revolutionary. He didn't believe in being </div>
<div id="to_152" class="t s1_152">a husband or a wife. He created the whole idea of the boyfriend or the girlfriend -- gopis, </div>
<div id="tp_152" class="t s1_152">girlfriends. Sixteen thousand girlfriends? Seems to be a little too much to manage. But </div>
<div id="tq_152" class="t s1_152">the myth is symbolic; it simply says "sixteen thousand disciples." They may have been </div>
<div id="tr_152" class="t s1_152">men, they may have been women -- that is not the point -- but a disciple is feminine. A </div>
<div id="ts_152" class="t s1_152">disciple is a gopi, is a girlfriend; otherwise he is not a disciple. </div>
<div id="tt_152" class="t s1_152">I have also got sixteen thousand sannyasins, the number has reached that exactly -- and </div>
<div id="tu_152" class="t s1_152">good ones, too. And you can see I am managing well. In fact it is not that I am managing </div>
<div id="tv_152" class="t s1_152">it well; it is love that manages well. Love always manages well -- with grace and ease. </div>
<div id="tw_152" class="t s1_152">Love knows no tension. </div>
<div id="tx_152" class="t s1_152">You cannot manage even a single woman because you don't know love yet. You cannot </div>
<div id="ty_152" class="t s1_152">manage a single love affair because love is missing. Only the affair is there and love is </div>
<div id="tz_152" class="t s1_152">missing, so of course it creates much trouble. </div>
<div id="t10_152" class="t s1_152">On my side, love is there and there is no affair. Love manages. </div>
<div id="t11_152" class="t s1_152">Question 4 </div>
<div id="t12_152" class="t s1_152">OSHO, IN SEVERAL PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WITH YOU, YOU USED TO SAY </div>
<div id="t13_152" class="t s1_152">SEVERAL THINGS TO ME. AT THE TIME, I USED TO THINK THAT IT WAS </div>
<div id="t14_152" class="t s1_152">ONLY PSYCHOLOGICAL ENCOURAGEMENT BY YOU, BUT IN THE COURSE </div>
<div id="t15_152" class="t s1_152">OF TIME ALL YOUR SAYINGS WERE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT IN </div>
