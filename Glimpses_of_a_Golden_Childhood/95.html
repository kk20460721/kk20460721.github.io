<div id="t1_95" class="t s1_95">CHAPTER 15.</div>
<div id="t2_95" class="t s2_95">sound, and nobody can fake it. So Magga Baba would show his magga with one hand and with the</div>
<div id="t3_95" class="t s2_95">other give the sign for money, meaning, ”If you have understood then give something to me.” And</div>
<div id="t4_95" class="t s2_95">people would give.</div>
<div id="t5_95" class="t s2_95">I would laugh myself to tears because he had not said anything. But he was not greedy for money.</div>
<div id="t6_95" class="t s2_95">He would take from one person and give it to another. His magga was always empty. Once in a</div>
<div id="t7_95" class="t s2_95">while there would be something in it, but rarely. It was a passage: money would come into it and go;</div>
<div id="t8_95" class="t s2_95">food would come into it and go; and it always remained empty. He was always cleaning it. I have</div>
<div id="t9_95" class="t s2_95">seen him morning, evening and afternoon, always cleaning it.</div>
<div id="ta_95" class="t s2_95">I want to confess to you – ”you” means the world – that I was the only person to whom he used</div>
<div id="tb_95" class="t s2_95">to speak, but only in privacy, when nobody else was present. I would go to him deep in the night,</div>
<div id="tc_95" class="t s2_95">perhaps two o’clock in the morning, because that was the most likely time to ﬁnd him alone. He</div>
<div id="td_95" class="t s2_95">would be hugged up in his old blanket, on a winter’s night, by the side of a ﬁre. I would sit at his</div>
<div id="te_95" class="t s2_95">side for a while. I never disturbed him; that was the one reason why he loved me. Once in a while</div>
<div id="tf_95" class="t s2_95">it would happen that he would turn on his side, open his eyes and see me sitting there and start</div>
<div id="tg_95" class="t s2_95">talking of his own accord.</div>
<div id="th_95" class="t s2_95">He was not a Hindi-speaking person so people thought it was difﬁcult to communicate with him, but</div>
<div id="ti_95" class="t s2_95">that is not true. He was certainly not a Hindi-oriented person, but he knew not only Hindi but many</div>
<div id="tj_95" class="t s2_95">other languages too. Of course he knew the language of silence the most; he remained silent almost</div>
<div id="tk_95" class="t s2_95">all his life. In the day he would not speak to anybody, but in the night he would speak to me, only</div>
<div id="tl_95" class="t s2_95">when I was alone. It was such a blessing to hear his few words.</div>
<div id="tm_95" class="t s2_95">Magga Baba never said anything about his own life, but he said many things about life. He was the</div>
<div id="tn_95" class="t s2_95">ﬁrst man who told me, ”Life is more than what it appears to be. Don’t judge by its appearances but</div>
<div id="to_95" class="t s2_95">go deep down into the valleys where the roots of life are.” He would suddenly speak, and suddenly</div>
<div id="tp_95" class="t s2_95">he would be silent. That was his way. There was no way to persuade him to speak: either he spoke</div>
<div id="tq_95" class="t s2_95">or not. He would not answer any questions, and the conversations between us two were an absolute</div>
<div id="tr_95" class="t s2_95">secret. Nobody knew about it. This is for the ﬁrst time that I am saying it.</div>
<div id="ts_95" class="t s2_95">I have heard many great speakers, and he was just a poor man, but his words were pure honey, so</div>
<div id="tt_95" class="t s2_95">sweet and nourishing, and so pregnant with meaning. ”But,” he told me, ”you are not to tell anybody</div>
<div id="tu_95" class="t s2_95">that I have been speaking to you, until I die, because many people think I am deaf. It is good for me</div>
<div id="tv_95" class="t s2_95">that they think so. Many think that I am mad – that is even better as far as I am concerned. Many</div>
<div id="tw_95" class="t s2_95">who are very intellectual try to ﬁgure out what I say, and it is just gibberish.</div>
<div id="tx_95" class="t s2_95">”I wonder, when I hear the meaning that they have derived from it.</div>
<div id="ty_95" class="t s2_95">I say to myself, ‘My God!</div>
<div id="tz_95" class="t s2_95">If</div>
<div id="t10_95" class="t s2_95">these people are the intellectuals, the professors, the pundits, the scholars, then what about the</div>
<div id="t11_95" class="t s2_95">poor crowd? I had not said anything, yet they have made up so many things out of nothing, just like</div>
<div id="t12_95" class="t s2_95">soap bubbles.’” For some reason, or maybe for no reason at all, he loved me.</div>
<div id="t13_95" class="t s2_95">I have had the fortune to be loved by many strange people. Magga Baba is the ﬁrst on my list.</div>
<div id="t14_95" class="t s2_95">The whole day he was surrounded by people. He was really a free man, yet not even free to move</div>
<div id="t15_95" class="t s2_95">a single inch because people were holding on to him. They would put him into a rickshaw and take</div>
<div id="t16_95" class="t s2_95">him away wherever they wanted. Of course he would not say no, because he was pretending to be</div>
<div id="t17_95" class="t s2_95">Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</div>
<div id="t18_95" class="t s2_95">95</div>
<div id="t19_95" class="t s3_95">Osho</div>
