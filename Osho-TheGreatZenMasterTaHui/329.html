<div id="t1_329" class="t s1_329">things which peaceful people will take a little time to do. He became very famous, and</div>
<div id="t2_329" class="t s1_329">thousands of people used to come just to touch his feet.</div>
<div id="t3_329" class="t s1_329">After twenty years he was in the capital. A man from his village had come for some</div>
<div id="t4_329" class="t s1_329">purpose, and he thought, "It will be good to go and see what transformation has happened to</div>
<div id="t5_329" class="t s1_329">Shantinath. So many stories are heard -- that he has become a totally new man, that his old</div>
<div id="t6_329" class="t s1_329">self is gone and a new, fresh being has arisen in him, that he really has become peace, silence,</div>
<div id="t7_329" class="t s1_329">tranquility."</div>
<div id="t8_329" class="t s1_329">So the man went with great respect. But when he saw Muni Shantinath, seeing his face, his</div>
<div id="t9_329" class="t s1_329">eyes, he could not think that there had been any change. There was none of the grace which</div>
<div id="ta_329" class="t s1_329">necessarily radiates from a mind which has become silent. Those eyes were still as egoistic --</div>
<div id="tb_329" class="t s1_329">in fact they had become more pointedly egoistic. The man's presence was even more ugly than</div>
<div id="tc_329" class="t s1_329">it used to be.</div>
<div id="td_329" class="t s1_329">Still, the man went close. Shantinath recognized the man, who had been his neighbor --</div>
<div id="te_329" class="t s1_329">but now it was beneath his dignity to recognize him. The man also saw that Shantinath had</div>
<div id="tf_329" class="t s1_329">recognized him, but he was pretending that he did not. He thought, "That shows much." He</div>
<div id="tg_329" class="t s1_329">went close by Shantinath and asked, "Can I ask you a question? What is your name?"</div>
<div id="th_329" class="t s1_329">Naturally, great anger arose in Shantinath because he knew that this man knew perfectly</div>
<div id="ti_329" class="t s1_329">well what his name was. But still he kept himself in control, and he said, "My name is Muni</div>
<div id="tj_329" class="t s1_329">Shantinath."</div>
<div id="tk_329" class="t s1_329">The man said, "It is a beautiful name -- but my memory is very short, can you repeat it</div>
<div id="tl_329" class="t s1_329">again? I have forgotten ... what name did you say?" ...</div>
<div id="tm_329" class="t s1_329">This was too much. Muni Shantinath used to carry a staff. He took the staff in his hand he</div>
<div id="tn_329" class="t s1_329">forgot everything -- twenty years of controlling the mind -- and he said, "Ask again and I will</div>
<div id="to_329" class="t s1_329">show you who I am. Have you forgotten? -- I killed my wife, I am the same man."</div>
<div id="tp_329" class="t s1_329">Only then did he recognize what had happened ... in a single moment of unconsciousness</div>
<div id="tq_329" class="t s1_329">he realized that twenty years have gone down the drain; he has not changed at all. But millions</div>
<div id="tr_329" class="t s1_329">of people feel great silence in him ... Yes, he has become very controlled, he keeps himself</div>
<div id="ts_329" class="t s1_329">repressed, and it has paid off. So much respect and he has no qualification for that respect --</div>
<div id="tt_329" class="t s1_329">so much honor, even kings come to touch his feet.</div>
<div id="tu_329" class="t s1_329">Your so-called saints are nothing but controlled animals. The mind is nothing but a long</div>
<div id="tv_329" class="t s1_329">heritage of all your animal past. You can control it, but the controlled mind is not the</div>
<div id="tw_329" class="t s1_329">awakened mind.</div>
<div id="tx_329" class="t s1_329">The process of controlling and repressing and disciplining is taught by all the religions,</div>
<div id="ty_329" class="t s1_329">and because of their fallacious teaching humanity has not moved a single inch -- it remains</div>
<div id="tz_329" class="t s1_329">barbarous. Any moment people start killing each other. It does not take a single moment to</div>
<div id="t10_329" class="t s1_329">lose themselves; they forget completely that they are human beings, and something much</div>
<div id="t11_329" class="t s1_329">more, something better is expected of them. There have been very few people who have been</div>
<div id="t12_329" class="t s1_329">able to avoid this deception of controlling mind and believing that they have attained</div>
<div id="t13_329" class="t s1_329">mindlessness.</div>
<div id="t14_329" class="t s1_329">To attain mindlessness a totally different process is involved: I call it the ultimate alchemy.</div>
<div id="t15_329" class="t s1_329">It consists only of a single element -- that of watchfulness.</div>
<div id="t16_329" class="t s1_329">Chapter 28 - Mindlessness</div>
<div id="t17_329" class="t s1_329">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
<div id="t18_329" class="t s1_329">329</div>
