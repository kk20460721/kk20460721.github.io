<div id="t1_252" class="t s1_252">This would continue for one hour, and he was again and again phoning to this and to that</div>
<div id="t2_252" class="t s1_252">place, and once in a while he would look at me and smile: "What nonsense I'm doing!" But I</div>
<div id="t3_252" class="t s1_252">had to keep absolutely serious. I never smiled at him. So he would again start phoning:</div>
<div id="t4_252" class="t s1_252">"Nobody is taking any notice, everybody is engaged in his own work."</div>
<div id="t5_252" class="t s1_252">One thousand people doing so many things ... and these things were continuously going on</div>
<div id="t6_252" class="t s1_252">in their minds. This was a great chance for them to bring them out. It was such a drama.</div>
<div id="t7_252" class="t s1_252">Jayantibhai used to be in charge of the camp in Mount Abu, and one of his closest friends</div>
<div id="t8_252" class="t s1_252">took off all his clothes. That was a surprise! Jayantibhai was standing by my side, and he</div>
<div id="t9_252" class="t s1_252">could not believe it. That man was a very serious man, very rich; what was he doing in front</div>
<div id="ta_252" class="t s1_252">of one thousand people? And then he started pushing the car in which I had come to the place</div>
<div id="tb_252" class="t s1_252">-- it was Jayantibhai's car. We were in the mountains, and just ahead there was a thousand-foot</div>
<div id="tc_252" class="t s1_252">drop, and he was pushing the car, naked.</div>
<div id="td_252" class="t s1_252">Jayantibhai asked me, "What has to be done? He is going to destroy the car, and I had</div>
<div id="te_252" class="t s1_252">never thought that this man was against my car. We are close friends."</div>
<div id="tf_252" class="t s1_252">So I told him, "You push it from the other side; otherwise he is going to ..."</div>
<div id="tg_252" class="t s1_252">So he was preventing the car ... and his friend was jumping around and shouting, "Get out</div>
<div id="th_252" class="t s1_252">of my way! I have always hated this car." -- because he did not have an imported car, and this</div>
<div id="ti_252" class="t s1_252">was an imported car which Jayantibhai was keeping for me. I was coming to Mount Abu three</div>
<div id="tj_252" class="t s1_252">or four times a year, so he was keeping that car just for me.</div>
<div id="tk_252" class="t s1_252">His friend must have been feeling jealous inside because he did not have an imported car.</div>
<div id="tl_252" class="t s1_252">And then a few people rushed to help, seeing the situation. When he saw that so many people</div>
<div id="tm_252" class="t s1_252">were preventing him, just out of protest he climbed a tree in front of me. Naked, he sat in the</div>
<div id="tn_252" class="t s1_252">top of the tree, and he started shaking the tree. There was every danger that he would fall on</div>
<div id="to_252" class="t s1_252">top of the thousand people with the tree. Jayantibhai asked me, "What has to be done now?"</div>
<div id="tp_252" class="t s1_252">I said, "He is your friend. Let him be, don't be worried. Just move the people to this side</div>
<div id="tq_252" class="t s1_252">and that, and let him do whatsoever he is doing. Now he is not destroying the car. At the most</div>
<div id="tr_252" class="t s1_252">he will have multiple fractures."</div>
<div id="ts_252" class="t s1_252">As people moved away, he stopped. Silently he sat in the tree. After the meditation was</div>
<div id="tt_252" class="t s1_252">over, he was still sitting in the tree, and Jayantibhai said, "Now get down. The meditation is</div>
<div id="tu_252" class="t s1_252">over."</div>
<div id="tv_252" class="t s1_252">As if he woke up from a sleep, he looked all around and saw that he was naked! He</div>
<div id="tw_252" class="t s1_252">jumped out of the tree, rushed to his clothes, and said, "What happened to me?" In the night</div>
<div id="tx_252" class="t s1_252">he came to see me and he said, "This was a very dangerous meditation! I could have killed</div>
<div id="ty_252" class="t s1_252">myself or somebody else. I could have destroyed the car, and I am a great friend of</div>
<div id="tz_252" class="t s1_252">Jayantibhai, and I had never thought ... but certainly there must have been this idea in me.</div>
<div id="t10_252" class="t s1_252">"I hated the idea that you always come in his car and I hated the idea that he has got an</div>
<div id="t11_252" class="t s1_252">imported car, but it was not at all conscious in me. And what was I doing in the tree? I must</div>
<div id="t12_252" class="t s1_252">have been carrying so much violence in me, I wanted to kill people."</div>
<div id="t13_252" class="t s1_252">That meditation was immensely helpful. It relaxed people in one hour so much that they</div>
<div id="t14_252" class="t s1_252">told me, "It seems a heavy load has disappeared from the head. We were not aware what we</div>
<div id="t15_252" class="t s1_252">were carrying in the mind." But upon becoming aware of it, there was no other way except an</div>
<div id="t16_252" class="t s1_252">unlimited expression.</div>
<div id="t17_252" class="t s1_252">Chapter 20 - Affliction</div>
<div id="t18_252" class="t s1_252">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
