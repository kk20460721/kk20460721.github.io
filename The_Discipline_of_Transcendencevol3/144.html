<div id="t1_144" class="t s1_144">And those Indians who have questions, they never come to me. I have created </div>
<div id="t2_144" class="t s1_144">too many barriers for them to come. Those Indians whose minds are too much </div>
<div id="t3_144" class="t s1_144">stuffed, they don't come to me -- and I don't want them here. I have made every </div>
<div id="t4_144" class="t s1_144">possible effort to prevent them from coming to me. I am not interested in them. </div>
<div id="t5_144" class="t s1_144">The Indians who come to me, come to be with me -- silently. They can </div>
<div id="t6_144" class="t s1_144">understand the language of silence. But when a Westerner comes, he cannot </div>
<div id="t7_144" class="t s1_144">understand the language of silence. He can understand only the language of </div>
<div id="t8_144" class="t s1_144">logic. So I have to talk -- I have to talk too much to the Westerners. By and by, I </div>
<div id="t9_144" class="t s1_144">persuade them to become silent. By and by, they also become Indians. But it </div>
<div id="ta_144" class="t s1_144">takes time. </div>
<div id="tb_144" class="t s1_144">For a spectator it may appear as if I am not paying attention to the Indians. And </div>
<div id="tc_144" class="t s1_144">the question is from a Westerner -- the question is from Anurag. You may see </div>
<div id="td_144" class="t s1_144">that when an Indian comes to take sannyas, I simply give him sannyas. Even if I </div>
<div id="te_144" class="t s1_144">ask him whether he has something to ask, he says no. Sometimes I don't even ask </div>
<div id="tf_144" class="t s1_144">him -- I can see that he has not come to ask any question. He has come to be with </div>
<div id="tg_144" class="t s1_144">me. And that is far more significant, far more deep. He has come just to see me, </div>
<div id="th_144" class="t s1_144">just to be with me. He wants a bridge in silence. </div>
<div id="ti_144" class="t s1_144">But to a watcher it will seem that I am not paying much attention, because when </div>
<div id="tj_144" class="t s1_144">I talk then you think I am paying attention. When I talk for half an hour to one </div>
<div id="tk_144" class="t s1_144">person, of course, you think I have been too much attentive to him. That simply </div>
<div id="tl_144" class="t s1_144">shows that the person is too much in the head and I have to persuade him. </div>
<div id="tm_144" class="t s1_144">The Western mind is only mind -- it has forgotten the heart. The Eastern mind is </div>
<div id="tn_144" class="t s1_144">not only mind -- the heart is still predominant, fortunately; the mind is </div>
<div id="to_144" class="t s1_144">secondary. So there is no need to talk much. He touches my feet and he is happy, </div>
<div id="tp_144" class="t s1_144">he is tremendously happy -- he has touched something real, he has touched </div>
<div id="tq_144" class="t s1_144">something from the unknown. To a Westerner it seems just meaningless: Then </div>
<div id="tr_144" class="t s1_144">why have you come? -- just to touch the feet? just to sit silently? Silently you can </div>
<div id="ts_144" class="t s1_144">sit at your home. Then why did you travel so far? </div>
<div id="tt_144" class="t s1_144">The Westerner knows only one way of communication and that is through </div>
<div id="tu_144" class="t s1_144">language, through logic, reason. I have to convince him. The Indian needs no </div>
<div id="tv_144" class="t s1_144">conviction. He is convinced about the fact of sannyas. If he has not taken </div>
<div id="tw_144" class="t s1_144">sannyas, it is not that he is not convinced -- it is only that he is not courageous </div>
<div id="tx_144" class="t s1_144">enough. He wants a little courage. </div>
<div id="ty_144" class="t s1_144">Convinced he is! Convinced he is for many lives -- that sannyas is the only way </div>
<div id="tz_144" class="t s1_144">to be, to be rightly in existence. Sannyas is the only way to reach God, to reach </div>
<div id="t10_144" class="t s1_144">truth, he is convinced. That is in the blood and in the bones. An Indian is born </div>
<div id="t11_144" class="t s1_144">with the desire to be a sannyasin. He may not be able to dare -- that's another </div>
<div id="t12_144" class="t s1_144">thing. So when he comes to me, he has not come for any conviction -- conviction </div>
<div id="t13_144" class="t s1_144">is already there -- he has come to me just to feel my vibe, so that he can gather a </div>
<div id="t14_144" class="t s1_144">little more courage and take the jump. </div>
<div id="t15_144" class="t s1_144">When a Westerner comes, he is not convinced at all. Sannyas? Seems just </div>
<div id="t16_144" class="t s1_144">outlandish, bizarre, eccentric! For the Westerner, sannyas simply has no appeal. </div>
<div id="t17_144" class="t s1_144">He has never thought about it. </div>
