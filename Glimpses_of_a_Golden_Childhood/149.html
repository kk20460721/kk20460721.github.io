<div id="t1_149" class="t s1_149">CHAPTER 22.</div>
<div id="t2_149" class="t s2_149">We became friends; that was sometime in 1940.</div>
<div id="t3_149" class="t s2_149">Only later on, years afterwards, just one year</div>
<div id="t4_149" class="t s2_149">before he died – he died in 1960, after twenty years of friendship, strange friendship – only then was</div>
<div id="t5_149" class="t s2_149">I able to tell him that the word he had been searching for had been invented by Carl Gustav Jung.</div>
<div id="t6_149" class="t s2_149">That word is ”synchronicity”; that is what is happening between us. He knew it; I knew it; but the</div>
<div id="t7_149" class="t s2_149">word was missing.</div>
<div id="t8_149" class="t s2_149">Synchronicity can mean many things all together, it is multidimensional.</div>
<div id="t9_149" class="t s2_149">It can mean a certain</div>
<div id="ta_149" class="t s2_149">rhythmic feeling; it can mean what people have always called love; it can mean friendship; it can</div>
<div id="tb_149" class="t s2_149">simply mean two hearts beating together without rhyme or reason... it is a mystery. Only once in a</div>
<div id="tc_149" class="t s2_149">while one ﬁnds someone with whom things ﬁt. Just the jigsaw disappears. All the pieces that were</div>
<div id="td_149" class="t s2_149">not ﬁtting are suddenly ﬁtting of their own accord.</div>
<div id="te_149" class="t s2_149">When I told my grandmother, ”I have become friends with the vice-president of this town,” she said,</div>
<div id="tf_149" class="t s2_149">”You mean Pandit Shambhuratan Dube?”</div>
<div id="tg_149" class="t s2_149">I said, ”You look a little shocked by it. What’s the matter with you, Nani?”</div>
<div id="th_149" class="t s2_149">Tears rolled down from her eyes. She said, ”Then you will not ﬁnd many friends in the world, that’s</div>
<div id="ti_149" class="t s2_149">why I am worried. If Shambhu Babu has become your friend then you will not ﬁnd many friends in</div>
<div id="tj_149" class="t s2_149">the world. Not only that; perhaps you may ﬁnd friends, because you are young, but Shambhu Babu</div>
<div id="tk_149" class="t s2_149">will certainly not ﬁnd another friend in the world, because he is too old.”</div>
<div id="tl_149" class="t s2_149">Again and again my grandmother will come into my story with her tremendous insight. Yes, I can</div>
<div id="tm_149" class="t s2_149">see it now. Recapitulating, I can see what she had seen and wept over. I know now that Shambhu</div>
<div id="tn_149" class="t s2_149">Babu never had any other friend. Except for me he was friendless. I used to visit my village once</div>
<div id="to_149" class="t s2_149">in a while, perhaps once a year, or twice, not more than that. And as I became more and more</div>
<div id="tp_149" class="t s2_149">involved in my own activity – or you can call it inactivity... as I became more and more involved with</div>
<div id="tq_149" class="t s2_149">the sannyasins, and the movement of meditation, my visits to the village became even rarer. In fact,</div>
<div id="tr_149" class="t s2_149">the last few years before he died my only visits were when I passed through the village on the train.</div>
<div id="ts_149" class="t s2_149">The station master was my sannyasin, so of course the train would stay as long as I wanted it to.</div>
<div id="tt_149" class="t s2_149">They – and by ”they” I mean my father, my mother, Shambhu Babu, and many others who loved me</div>
<div id="tu_149" class="t s2_149">– would come to the station. That would be my only visit; ten, twenty, at the most thirty minutes.</div>
<div id="tv_149" class="t s2_149">The train could not be delayed any longer because other trains had to come. They would be waiting</div>
<div id="tw_149" class="t s2_149">outside the station.</div>
<div id="tx_149" class="t s2_149">But I can understand his loneliness. He had no other friends. Almost every day he wrote a letter to</div>
<div id="ty_149" class="t s2_149">me – that is very rare – and there was nothing to write. Sometimes he would just send the empty</div>
<div id="tz_149" class="t s2_149">paper inside an envelope. I would understand even that. He was feeling very lonely, and would like</div>
<div id="t10_149" class="t s2_149">to have my company. I tried my best to be there as much as it was practical, because to me it was</div>
<div id="t11_149" class="t s2_149">really a drag to be in that village. It was just for him that I suffered that village.</div>
<div id="t12_149" class="t s2_149">After he died I rarely, very rarely went there. I now had an excuse, that I could not come because it</div>
<div id="t13_149" class="t s2_149">reminded me of Shambhu Babu. But really there was no point in going there. When he was there,</div>
<div id="t14_149" class="t s2_149">there was a point. He was just a small oasis in a desert.</div>
<div id="t15_149" class="t s2_149">He was absolutely unafraid about all kinds of condemnation that came to him because of me. To be</div>
<div id="t16_149" class="t s2_149">associated with me, even in those days, was not a good thing. It was dangerous. They told him, ”You</div>

<div id="t18_149" class="t s2_149">149</div>
