<div id="t1_20" class="t s1_20">Ramakrishna is beautiful -- singing the praise of God, praying, worshipping, dancing. </div>
<div id="t2_20" class="t s1_20">He is something of the beyond. He reminds you that much more is possible in life than </div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">is happening to you -- but that's all. Through him just a little remembrance can reach </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">you. But your life is such that that remembrance is not going to create any mutation; it </div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s1_20">will be forgotten. You will enjoy it. Again and again you would like to go to the man </div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s1_20">and see him dancing and singing and praying...and you will feel good. </div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s1_20">This is what Buddha calls "counting the sheep of others." He is a beautiful flower, but </div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">by looking at a rose you cannot become the rose; neither can you become a </div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">Ramakrishna by looking at Ramakrishna. Great effort is needed. You have to climb the </div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">mountain against all hazards. </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">Unless a master tries to approach you in your deep sleep, unless he stirs your being, </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">holds you hard and takes you out of your ignorance, it is impossible, it is almost </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">impossible. But you will be angry at this man -- who wants to be disturbed? One has </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">become accustomed to a certain way of life; mind always likes the old, the known, the </div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s1_20">familiar. Even though it is miserable, still the mind is afraid of the new, because with </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s1_20">the new you have to learn again how to behave, how to be. And who wants to learn? </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">You are so efficient with the old, your ego is so satisfied with the old -- why bother? </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">And when you come across a man like Gurdjieff, he shatters all the nonsense that you </div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">have gathered. He shatters mercilessly! Sometimes he has to say things which are not </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">really true, but just to shatter your ideas he has to say them. </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s1_20">A friend has asked, "How was it possible that a man like Gurdjieff, a man of such great </div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s1_20">understanding, did not understand the idea of kundalini energy?" </div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s1_20">He called it kundabuffer. He was very much against the idea of kundalini. He used to </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s1_20">say that the worst thing that could happen to a person in life is the arousal of kundalini. </div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s1_20">The questioner, naturally, is bewildered. </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s1_20">But you don't understand the real meaning of Gurdjieff. He called it kundabuffer </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s1_20">because of the nonsense that theosophists have created in the world. They talked so </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">much about kundalini, the serpent power, and it was all gibberish; they knew nothing </div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s1_20">about it. They were just fabricating, they were just inventing theories and ideas. It was </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s1_20">all guesswork. </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">In fact, out of a hundred books that are written about kundalini, ninety-nine are </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">absolute nonsense. And the people who had gathered around Gurdjieff had come </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s1_20">through theosophical philosophy, hypotheses, doctrines. He was shattering their </div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s1_20">knowledge; he was not saying anything against kundalini. How could he say that? He </div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s1_20">knew far better than Blavatsky, Annie Besant, Alcott, Leadbeater -- he knew far better </div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s1_20">than these people. These people were only experts in creating doctrines, and really they </div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s1_20">were great experts. They had created almost a world movement -- about auras and </div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s1_20">colors and kundalini...new words from the ancient spiritual lore. And they created </div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s1_20">worlds, imaginary worlds, around those words. </div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s1_20">Gurdjieff is right to call it kundabuffer. And Gurdjieff is right in saying that the worst </div>
<div id="t15_20" class="t s1_20">thing that can happen to a man is the arousal of kundalini. But remember always that </div>
<div id="t16_20" class="t s1_20">he was talking to his disciples, in a particular context. He was shattering the knowledge </div>
