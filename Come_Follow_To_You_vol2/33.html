<div id="t4_33" class="t s1_33">the gardener from the garden. The gardener cannot be proved because the </div>
<div id="t5_33" class="t s1_33">gardener doesn't exist. A gardener separate from the garden is nonexistential. </div>
<div id="t6_33" class="t s1_33">That's why the skeptical friend could argue. And his argument is valid -- valid </div>
<div id="t7_33" class="t s1_33">not against God or the gardener; valid against the believer. The believer has </div>
<div id="t8_33" class="t s1_33">taken the wrong argument. </div>
<div id="t9_33" class="t s1_33">To me, God is herenow. All that you see is God. God is not something beyond; </div>
<div id="ta_33" class="t s1_33">God is something within. Or, if you like paradoxes, you can call God the within </div>
<div id="tb_33" class="t s1_33">beyond or the beyond within. But God is intrinsic, God is the innermost core of </div>

<div id="te_33" class="t s1_33">God who is separate from His creatures and the creation. He is not, He cannot be. </div>
<div id="tf_33" class="t s1_33">He is one with it: He is in it, He is it. Once this is understood, you start flowing; </div>
<div id="tg_33" class="t s1_33">your whole life becomes a prayer. </div>
<div id="th_33" class="t s1_33">That is the basic message of Jesus. That's why he goes on saying that "God is my </div>
<div id="ti_33" class="t s1_33">father." It is a way of saying what I am saying to you. </div>
<div id="tj_33" class="t s1_33">Between the father and the son, or between the mother and the child, there is a </div>
<div id="tk_33" class="t s1_33">continuity. The father goes on living in the son; the mother continues in the child. </div>
<div id="tl_33" class="t s1_33">The son is nothing but an extension of the existence of the father -- an extended </div>

<div id="tn_33" class="t s1_33">disappear, and the father has created a new body to live within. </div>
<div id="to_33" class="t s1_33">When Jesus says, "God is my father," he simply means that "I am continuous </div>

<div id="tq_33" class="t s1_33">cell He is flowing. Nowhere has there been a discontinuity." That is the whole </div>

<div id="ts_33" class="t s1_33">unsophisticated people. He is talking to real people, not to plastic people; he is </div>
<div id="tt_33" class="t s1_33">not talking in a university. He is talking to real people -- people who are alive. </div>
<div id="tu_33" class="t s1_33">He uses the word'father'. And it is beautiful in a way, because unless religion </div>
<div id="tv_33" class="t s1_33">becomes personal, it remains a philosophy. When religion becomes personal, it </div>
<div id="tw_33" class="t s1_33">becomes life. Religion is something to be lived, not something to brood about. It </div>
<div id="tx_33" class="t s1_33">is something that should become a milieu around you; it is something that </div>
<div id="ty_33" class="t s1_33">should become a continuous breathing, continuous beating of the heart. </div>
<div id="tz_33" class="t s1_33">Religion is a way of life, a way of being. It has nothing to do with thinking. When </div>
<div id="t10_33" class="t s1_33">Jesus says, "God is father," he means this existence is not alien, this existence is a </div>
<div id="t11_33" class="t s1_33">home. You can rest in it, you can rely on it; you need not be afraid. </div>
<div id="t12_33" class="t s1_33">This is one of the most significant things to be understood, because modern man </div>
<div id="t13_33" class="t s1_33">is so much afraid. Never before has that been so. Never before in the history of </div>
<div id="t14_33" class="t s1_33">humankind has man been as afraid as he is now. </div>
