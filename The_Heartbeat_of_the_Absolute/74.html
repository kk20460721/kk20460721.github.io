<div id="t1_74" class="t s1_74">CHAPTER 8. THE SHADOW OF THE EGO</div>
<div id="t2_74" class="t s2_74">people. People used to say, ”Here is a living example of one whom the Upanishads call a Maharishi.”</div>
<div id="t3_74" class="t s2_74">Yet here he was, being troubled by an old man from his neighborhood. And the harassment was not</div>
<div id="t4_74" class="t s2_74">for just one day or one morning or evening, but continued every day, because the old man, having</div>
<div id="t5_74" class="t s2_74">nothing to do, spent all his time sitting on a chair near the door of his house so Rabindranath found</div>
<div id="t6_74" class="t s2_74">it difﬁcult to avoid him.</div>
<div id="t7_74" class="t s2_74">Rabindranath has written in his diary that he found it very difﬁcult to leave the house: ”Before going</div>
<div id="t8_74" class="t s2_74">out, I would inquire whether the old man was sitting there or not. Otherwise he would grab hold</div>
<div id="t9_74" class="t s2_74">of me and ask, ’Have you seen God? Have you known him?’ I used to tremble on hearing these</div>
<div id="ta_74" class="t s2_74">questions because I know nothing about him. On hearing my answer the old man would laugh loudly</div>
<div id="tb_74" class="t s2_74">and heartily. His laughing in that way spoiled my sleep, it began to haunt me; I began to be afraid</div>
<div id="tc_74" class="t s2_74">of that old man. Once I thought, ’I really created trouble for myself writing this Gitanjali.’ I thought,</div>
<div id="td_74" class="t s2_74">’That old man must have had some glimpse of God, otherwise he could not haunt me so.’” From his</div>
<div id="te_74" class="t s2_74">eyes it appeared he knew something, because Rabindranath could not get away with it by staring at</div>
<div id="tf_74" class="t s2_74">him and repeating one or two lines of the Gitanjali in answer to his question.</div>
<div id="tg_74" class="t s2_74">Thus years passed, and the old man continued his haunting.</div>
<div id="th_74" class="t s2_74">Rabindranath has said: ”A great</div>
<div id="ti_74" class="t s2_74">load was removed from my mind on the day on which I could tell him, ’I have known God.’” It</div>
<div id="tj_74" class="t s2_74">was the beginning of the rainy season, and the ﬁrst downpours were leaving puddles everywhere.</div>
<div id="tk_74" class="t s2_74">Reservoirs and small pits on the roadsides ﬁlled with water. Frogs were croaking. It was morning</div>
<div id="tl_74" class="t s2_74">and Rabindranath was tempted out by these changes in nature – the croaking of the frogs, the</div>
<div id="tm_74" class="t s2_74">confused din of the falling rain, the new fragrance of the earth. He saw the old man was not on his</div>
<div id="tn_74" class="t s2_74">usual seat. Perhaps he was not up yet.</div>
<div id="to_74" class="t s2_74">Rabindranath ran out of his house. The sun was rising over the sea. He stopped at the seashore.</div>
<div id="tp_74" class="t s2_74">The sun was shimmering on the water. He looked at the sun and its reﬂection, and then began to</div>
<div id="tq_74" class="t s2_74">return to his home. The sun was reﬂected in each puddle, in each small pond, in every dirty ditch</div>
<div id="tr_74" class="t s2_74">on the roadside. It was shining all around – in dirty puddles, on the sea, in clean small streams, on</div>
<div id="ts_74" class="t s2_74">every side. Seeing all this, some music, some unknown, indeﬁnable sound within began to play in</div>
<div id="tt_74" class="t s2_74">Rabindranath’s heart.</div>
<div id="tu_74" class="t s2_74">As he returned, he was dancing. He was dancing because he saw that the reﬂection of the sun was</div>
<div id="tv_74" class="t s2_74">never tarnished. He was dancing because he saw that the sun’s reﬂection was as fresh and clean in</div>
<div id="tw_74" class="t s2_74">the dirty, muddy water as it was in the cleanest water. Reﬂection can never be dirty. How can it be</div>
<div id="tx_74" class="t s2_74">dirty? Only water can be muddy and dirty. But the sun that looks into it, whose reﬂection appears</div>
<div id="ty_74" class="t s2_74">in it, is not dirty. It is absolutely fresh and clean. No water can spoil it. This was a tremendous, a</div>
<div id="tz_74" class="t s2_74">revolutionary experience for him. It meant that God, who is even within the worst of men, cannot</div>
<div id="t10_74" class="t s2_74">be made dirty. The reﬂection of God in the most sinful person is as pure as it is in the most pious</div>
<div id="t11_74" class="t s2_74">person. So he was returning dancing. A door had opened within.</div>
<div id="t12_74" class="t s2_74">That old man was sitting near his door. This was the ﬁrst time he was not afraid of the old man, and</div>
<div id="t13_74" class="t s2_74">for the ﬁrst time the old man said, ”It is all right, it seems you have known him.” And the old man</div>
<div id="t14_74" class="t s2_74">approached Rabindranath and embraced him and said, ”Your ecstasy, your dancing today, tells me</div>
<div id="t15_74" class="t s2_74">that you have known him. Now I can honor you!”</div>
<div id="t16_74" class="t s2_74">Then for three days Rabindranath remained in a state of ecstasy – in a state of madness.</div>
<div id="t17_74" class="t s2_74">The</div>
<div id="t18_74" class="t s2_74">members of the family were afraid to see this. Only the old man often used to come and tell them,</div>
<div id="t19_74" class="t s2_74">The Heartbeat of the Absolute</div>
<div id="t1a_74" class="t s2_74">74</div>
<div id="t1b_74" class="t s3_74">Osho</div>
