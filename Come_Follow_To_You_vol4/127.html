<div id="t3_127" class="t s1_127">many man-made laws, but there is only one Law, the Tao; what Buddha calls the </div>
<div id="t4_127" class="t s1_127">DHAMMA. </div>
<div id="t5_127" class="t s1_127">Jesus brings disorder to make you alert. He is like an alarm he wants to awake </div>
<div id="t6_127" class="t s1_127">you but you feel offended. He disturbs your sleep, and maybe you were having a </div>
<div id="t7_127" class="t s1_127">beautiful dream. He disturbs your dream. You want him not to disturb you. And </div>
<div id="t8_127" class="t s1_127">yet there is a deep attraction because his call appeals to your depth; it is from </div>
<div id="t9_127" class="t s1_127">depth to depth. Your mind says no, but your innermost being starts saying yes -- </div>
<div id="ta_127" class="t s1_127">that is the fear. The Jews were not afraid of what Jesus was saying, the Jews were </div>
<div id="tb_127" class="t s1_127">afraid because they were feeling, deep down, an attraction, a call, an appeal. By </div>
<div id="tc_127" class="t s1_127">murdering Jesus they defended themselves. They defended their own periphery </div>
<div id="td_127" class="t s1_127">against their own center. Or, you can say, they defended the man-made order </div>
<div id="te_127" class="t s1_127">against the God-made order. They defended the law of Moses against the law of </div>
<div id="tf_127" class="t s1_127">God Himself. That's what is meant when Jesus says,'Moses brings law to you, I </div>
<div id="tg_127" class="t s1_127">bring love.' Love is the Tao. </div>

<div id="tk_127" class="t s1_127">are thrown overboard. When you love a person, rules are not needed. They are </div>
<div id="tl_127" class="t s1_127">needed only when you don't love a person. But then love brings its own rule, </div>
