<div id="t3_140" class="t s1_140">Then you have to say, 'This body is Ram.'" </div>
<div id="t4_140" class="t s1_140">But Ram would say, "I cannot assert something which is not true. I cannot say 'I am </div>

<div id="td_140" class="t s1_140">people ran with him! Not only those who were surrounding him but others also who </div>
<div id="te_140" class="t s1_140">were standing here and there or who had come for a morning walk, and people who </div>
<div id="tf_140" class="t s1_140">were sitting on the benches reading their newspapers, they threw their newspapers. A </div>
<div id="tg_140" class="t s1_140">great crowd was following him, and he was laughing and giggling, and the whole </div>
<div id="th_140" class="t s1_140">crowd was following him. </div>
<div id="ti_140" class="t s1_140">And then he stood under a tree and he said, "Why are you following me? For what? I </div>
