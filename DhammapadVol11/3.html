<div id="t1_3" class="t s1_3">immediately there is a radical change in your vision, your gestalt changes. The outside </div>
<div id="t2_3" class="t s1_3">world disappears and the inside world appears. </div>
<div id="t3_3" class="t s1_3">It is because of this that the mystics say that the outside world is illusory. Not that it </div>
<div id="t4_3" class="t s1_3">does not exist; it exists, but it is illusory because the mystic knows a certain state of </div>
<div id="t5_3" class="t s1_3">consciousness when it simply evaporates, it is found no more. You enter into a totally </div>
<div id="t6_3" class="t s1_3">different dimension: the dimension of bliss, the dimension of peace, the dimension of </div>
<div id="t7_3" class="t s1_3">Buddha, Christ, Krishna. </div>
<div id="t8_3" class="t s1_3">These sutras today are very special. This whole series... this is the last series of Buddha's </div>
<div id="t9_3" class="t s1_3">sutras. Up to now he was talking to the disciples who were getting ready. Now this last </div>
<div id="ta_3" class="t s1_3">part of his sutras is meant for the BODHISATTVAS, for those who have become ready, </div>
<div id="tb_3" class="t s1_3">for those who have experienced something of the inner. It is not for the initiates, it is not </div>
<div id="tc_3" class="t s1_3">for the adepts. Hence this last part is the most important part. </div>
<div id="td_3" class="t s1_3">Buddha says there are two kinds of enlightened people in the world; he is very scientific </div>
<div id="te_3" class="t s1_3">about his approach. His categories are very significant; nobody has done that before or </div>
<div id="tf_3" class="t s1_3">since. He says the first category of the enlightened ones is called ARHATAS. The arhata </div>
<div id="tg_3" class="t s1_3">is a mystic; he has known, he has realized, but he is utterly unconcerned about others. </div>
<div id="th_3" class="t s1_3">He has found the way. He has reached his home and he does not care about others who </div>
<div id="ti_3" class="t s1_3">are seeking and searching, because his understanding is that if they seek and search </div>
<div id="tj_3" class="t s1_3">authentically they will find the way themselves. And if they are not true seekers, </div>
<div id="tk_3" class="t s1_3">nobody can make them true seekers; hence no help is needed. The arhata does not help </div>
<div id="tl_3" class="t s1_3">anyone. He has traveled alone and he knows everybody has to travel alone. </div>
<div id="tm_3" class="t s1_3">When Buddha became enlightened himself, his first idea was to become an arhata. For </div>
<div id="tn_3" class="t s1_3">seven days he remained absolutely silent, not saying a single word. </div>
<div id="to_3" class="t s1_3">The story is: Gods from heaven came. They were very much worried because only once </div>
<div id="tp_3" class="t s1_3">in a while does a person become awakened, and if he remains absolutely silent the </div>
<div id="tq_3" class="t s1_3">world will miss his message. And his message is a medicine for those who are dying; </div>
<div id="tr_3" class="t s1_3">his message is a nourishment for those who are starving for truth. His message can be a </div>
<div id="ts_3" class="t s1_3">boat to the other shore. His message HAS to be delivered, he has to be persuaded. They </div>
<div id="tt_3" class="t s1_3">came, and they argued. </div>
<div id="tu_3" class="t s1_3">But Buddha said, "You must agree with me that nobody was able to help me -- of </div>
<div id="tv_3" class="t s1_3">course, I knocked on many doors -- because it is something which is not transferable. </div>
<div id="tw_3" class="t s1_3">Even if they had it they could not give it to me; I had to find it by my own effort. Hence </div>
<div id="tx_3" class="t s1_3">I think that is the only way: people have to seek and search; it cannot be borrowed." </div>
<div id="ty_3" class="t s1_3">He was right and the gods had to agree. And he said, "Even if I say it, only one out of </div>
<div id="tz_3" class="t s1_3">ten thousand people will understand. The remaining ones will not understand; on the </div>
<div id="t10_3" class="t s1_3">contrary, they will MISunderstand. So why create so much misunderstanding in the </div>
<div id="t11_3" class="t s1_3">world? The world is already in confusion -- why create more confusion? Out of </div>
<div id="t12_3" class="t s1_3">compassion I am keeping quiet. And the one who will understand will find it himself </div>
<div id="t13_3" class="t s1_3">anyway. The man who can understand what I say is so intelligent that really he needs </div>
<div id="t14_3" class="t s1_3">no help. So what is the point? Why should I bother?" </div>
<div id="t15_3" class="t s1_3">The gods were silenced. They moved into the woods to ponder over the matter. "How </div>
<div id="t16_3" class="t s1_3">to convince the Buddha? He appears to be right, he is logical, but some way has to be </div>
