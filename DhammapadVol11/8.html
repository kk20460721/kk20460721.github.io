<div id="t3_8" class="t s1_8">get support for it. If you don't answer they will think you are not answering because </div>
<div id="t4_8" class="t s1_8">other people, the common people, won't understand it; it is such a subtle matter that </div>
<div id="t5_8" class="t s1_8">only very few people can understand it. </div>
<div id="t6_8" class="t s1_8">Now one woman has inquired, "Beloved Master, what do you say? I feel I have become </div>

<div id="ti_8" class="t s1_8">something totally against your intrinsic nature, your inner voice, then forget all about it. </div>
<div id="tj_8" class="t s1_8">An arhata also helps in his own way; without helping he helps -- by his presence. He </div>
<div id="tk_8" class="t s1_8">remains in his silence, he lives his ordinary life without telling anybody anything, </div>
<div id="tl_8" class="t s1_8">without manifesting his experience, without expressing his joy. He lives joyously, but </div>
<div id="tm_8" class="t s1_8">he makes no deliberate effort to communicate. Still, a few sensitive souls will be </div>
