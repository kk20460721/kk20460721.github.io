<div id="t1_51" class="t s1_51">That's how YOU have to learn to die. The way of the leaf is the way of the sannyasin </div>
<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">too. And your hold has to be tender; otherwise it will be difficult to let go. Your hold </div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">has to be almost not a hold at all. Your hold cannot be a clinging. Only those people </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">cling who don't understand this polar game of existence, and their clinging destroys all. </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">They have to die, but their death becomes graceless. They have to die, as everybody </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">else, but their death becomes agony. </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">The word 'agony' comes from AGON -- agon means struggle. Agony means struggle. </div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">They die fighting. The whole fight is an exercise in futility: they are not going to win, </div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s1_51">but still they go on trying. Millions of people have tried and failed; still we are such </div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">fools, we go on repeating the same pattern. We still hope that "Maybe I am the </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">exception, maybe I can manage somehow." </div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">Nobody has been able to manage, not because they have not tried enough, not because </div>
<div id="td_51" class="t s1_51">they have not tried strongly, but because it is not possible in the very nature of things. </div>
<div id="te_51" class="t s1_51">They have done all that can be done, nothing has been left undone, but death is bound </div>
<div id="tf_51" class="t s1_51">to happen -- in fact it has already happened in your very birth. To be born is one pole; </div>
<div id="tg_51" class="t s1_51">the other pole is hidden in it. </div>
<div id="th_51" class="t s1_51">One starts dying the moment one starts breathing. The first moment of birth is also the </div>
<div id="ti_51" class="t s1_51">first moment of death. Yes, it takes seventy, eighty years to complete the process. Death </div>
<div id="tj_51" class="t s1_51">does not come suddenly after eighty years; it grows, it grows every moment. It is </div>
<div id="tk_51" class="t s1_51">growing now</div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s1_51">....</div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">Life is one wing, death is another wing, and both wings are yours. And </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">you are trying to fly with one wing? This is how you create misery for yourself, failure </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">and frustration. Accept both. </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">Let your hold be tender, so tender that it can be dropped at any moment and there will </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">be no struggle in dropping it, not even a moment's delay -- because even a moment's </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">delay is enough to miss the point, to miss the grace of it. </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">My work here consists of teaching you how to live and how to die, how to be joyous </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">and how to be sad, how to enjoy your youth and how to enjoy your old age, how to </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">enjoy your health and how to enjoy your illness. If I teach you only how to enjoy your </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">health, your joy, your life, and the other part is neglected, then I am teaching you </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">something which is going to create a division in you, a split in you. </div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s1_51">I teach you the totality of existence. Don't possess, don't hold anything, don't cling. Let </div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s1_51">things come and pass. Allow things to pass through you, and you remain always </div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s1_51">vulnerable, available. And then there is great beauty, great grace, great ecstasy. Your </div>
<div id="t10_51" class="t s1_51">sadness will also bring a depth to you, as much as your joy. Your death will bring great </div>
<div id="t11_51" class="t s1_51">gifts to you, as many as life itself. Then a man knows that this whole existence is his: </div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s1_51">nights and days, summers and winters, all are yours. </div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s1_51">In remaining vulnerable, open, relaxed, you become a master. That's a strange </div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s1_51">phenomenon, very paradoxical: in remaining surrendered to existence you become </div>
<div id="t15_51" class="t s1_51">victorious. And these moments will be coming to you again and again. My whole effort </div>
<div id="t16_51" class="t s1_51">is to bring more and more of such moments, such penetrating moments, for you. Don't </div>
<div id="t17_51" class="t s1_51">behave stupidly, don't go on repeating old strategies, old patterns of your mind. Learn </div>
<div id="t18_51" class="t s1_51">new ways of being. </div>
