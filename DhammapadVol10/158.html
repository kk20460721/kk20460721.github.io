<div id="tf_158" class="t s1_158">Once it happened: </div>
<div id="tg_158" class="t s1_158">A blind man was brought to Gautama the Buddha. He was a logician, a philosopher, </div>
<div id="th_158" class="t s1_158">very argumentative. He had been arguing with the village that there is no light, "and </div>

<div id="tj_158" class="t s1_158">difference." He was saying this to people who had eyes! And he was so clever in </div>
<div id="tk_158" class="t s1_158">argument that the villagers were at a loss what to do with this man. </div>
<div id="tl_158" class="t s1_158">He was asking them, "Bring your light. Let me taste it or smell it or touch it. Only then </div>
<div id="tm_158" class="t s1_158">will I believe." </div>
<div id="tn_158" class="t s1_158">Now, light cannot be touched, cannot be tasted, cannot be smelled. You cannot hear it. </div>
<div id="to_158" class="t s1_158">And these were the four senses available to the blind man. Then he would laugh in </div>
<div id="tp_158" class="t s1_158">victory. He would say, "Look! There is no light. Otherwise, give me the proofs!" </div>
<div id="tq_158" class="t s1_158">When Buddha came to the village, the villagers thought it would be good: "Let us take </div>
<div id="tr_158" class="t s1_158">this man to Buddha." </div>
<div id="ts_158" class="t s1_158">They brought the man to Buddha. Buddha listened to the whole story and then he said, </div>

<div id="t11_158" class="t s1_158">Remember, to prove that there is no God is very easy; to prove that there IS God is </div>
<div id="t12_158" class="t s1_158">impossible. To prove the negative is easy because all logic tends to be negative. To </div>
