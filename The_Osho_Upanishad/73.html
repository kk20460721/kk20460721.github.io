<div id="t1_73" class="t s1_73">CHAPTER 7. SILENCE IS A SONG WITHOUT WORDS</div>
<div id="t2_73" class="t s2_73">there is no breathing... and not just for a second or two; he was capable for ten minutes. Medical</div>
<div id="t3_73" class="t s2_73">science has its own limits. For ten minutes, no sign of breathing</div>
<div id="t4_73" class="t s2_73">....</div>
<div id="t5_73" class="t s2_73">In Oxford, in Cambridge, in Calcutta University, in Rangoon University; he went all over the world.</div>
<div id="t6_73" class="t s2_73">He forgot completely the mission of his life, that he had been meditating to attain to his innermost</div>
<div id="t7_73" class="t s2_73">self. That’s how people get distracted – he became an entertainer, a showman. He earned much,</div>
<div id="t8_73" class="t s2_73">he became world famous. And the doctors everywhere were shocked. In every medical college of</div>
<div id="t9_73" class="t s2_73">importance in the world he was examined with all their reﬁned instruments. They had to declare that</div>
<div id="ta_73" class="t s2_73">the man was dead, and after ten minutes he would start breathing again.</div>
<div id="tb_73" class="t s2_73">It was not that he was not breathing for ten minutes; he was breathing, but the breathing had gone</div>
<div id="tc_73" class="t s2_73">so slow that it was beyond the instruments’ capacity to capture its movement.</div>
<div id="td_73" class="t s2_73">This happened to you reading MIRDAD, that you felt your breathing was changing. It was beautiful.</div>
<div id="te_73" class="t s2_73">And because your breathing changed, that’s why you came to a point where you were indecisive.</div>
<div id="tf_73" class="t s2_73">Whether you were sad or silent, blissful, ecstatic, you could not decide, because the thing was so</div>
<div id="tg_73" class="t s2_73">new and you had no category to put it in.</div>
<div id="th_73" class="t s2_73">But I will tell you: You were sad, sad because you have wasted your whole life – and this space was</div>
<div id="ti_73" class="t s2_73">so close; you were just to reach and it was going to be available to you. You were sad, just like a</div>
<div id="tj_73" class="t s2_73">beggar will be sad who comes to know that he is the emperor and there has been some mistake;</div>
<div id="tk_73" class="t s2_73">the beggar is sitting on the throne and the emperor is begging in the streets.</div>
<div id="tl_73" class="t s2_73">All those years of</div>
<div id="tm_73" class="t s2_73">begging... a shadow, a sadness.</div>
<div id="tn_73" class="t s2_73">You also felt silence, because THE BOOK OF MIRDAD has been created by a man who knows the</div>
<div id="to_73" class="t s2_73">inner workings of human consciousness. He was not a writer; hence, nobody ever bothered to give</div>
<div id="tp_73" class="t s2_73">him a Nobel prize. He was alive in this century, he was our contemporary. His book has not been</div>
<div id="tq_73" class="t s2_73">translated into many languages for the simple reason that the book is unique – it is not a book, it is</div>
<div id="tr_73" class="t s2_73">a device. And it is not meant to be read, it is meant to create a certain atmosphere around you. If</div>
<div id="ts_73" class="t s2_73">you are ready, available, receptive, the atmosphere will be created and there will be great silence.</div>
<div id="tt_73" class="t s2_73">And silence is always blissful.</div>
<div id="tu_73" class="t s2_73">So you got very much confused: There was sadness because of the past; there was silence because</div>
<div id="tv_73" class="t s2_73">of the present – and silence is always bringing ﬂowers of blissfulness.</div>
<div id="tw_73" class="t s2_73">You thought there must be something in the words, so you read those words again. But you could not</div>
<div id="tx_73" class="t s2_73">ﬁnd it; in those words there was nothing, they were ordinary words. From where was this experience</div>
<div id="ty_73" class="t s2_73">happening?</div>
<div id="tz_73" class="t s2_73">It was happening because you are on the path.</div>
<div id="t10_73" class="t s2_73">You are part of a mystery school.</div>
<div id="t11_73" class="t s2_73">You are a seeker.</div>
<div id="t12_73" class="t s2_73">It would not have happened to you if you were not on the path. It happened to you because you were</div>
<div id="t13_73" class="t s2_73">getting ready for this happening, and THE BOOK OF MIRDAD simply triggered what was already</div>
<div id="t14_73" class="t s2_73">The Osho Upanishad</div>
<div id="t15_73" class="t s2_73">73</div>
<div id="t16_73" class="t s3_73">Osho</div>
