<div id="t2_49" class="t s2_49">Man is afraid that people might say something bad about him.</div>
<div id="t3_49" class="t s2_49">He feels happy if people say</div>
<div id="t4_49" class="t s2_49">something good about him because his knowledge of himself depends on their opinion. He doesn’t</div>
<div id="t5_49" class="t s2_49">have immediate knowledge of himself; he does not have any direct experience of knowing himself.</div>
<div id="t6_49" class="t s2_49">This experience can happen, but it doesn’t because we try to escape from it.</div>
<div id="t7_49" class="t s2_49">The ﬁrst thing in encountering the mind is not to bother about what others say or how one appears</div>
<div id="t8_49" class="t s2_49">to others; rather, one has to have a direct encounter with what one essentially is. In one’s aloneness</div>
<div id="t9_49" class="t s2_49">one has to open one’s mind totally and see what is there.</div>
<div id="ta_49" class="t s2_49">It is an act of courage.</div>
<div id="tb_49" class="t s2_49">It is an act</div>
<div id="tc_49" class="t s2_49">of tremendous courage to decide to enter into the hell hidden within oneself. It is an act of great</div>
<div id="td_49" class="t s2_49">courage to see oneself in one’s nudity. Great courage is needed.</div>
<div id="te_49" class="t s2_49">Once there was an emperor. Every day he used to disappear into a room built in the middle of his</div>
<div id="tf_49" class="t s2_49">palace. His family, the people in his house, his friends, his ministers were all surprised about this</div>
<div id="tg_49" class="t s2_49">habit. He used to always keep the key of that room on himself and when he went into the room he</div>
<div id="th_49" class="t s2_49">would lock the door from the inside. There was only one door to the room and not a single window.</div>
<div id="ti_49" class="t s2_49">During a period of twenty-four hours, he would stay in that room for at least one hour.</div>
<div id="tj_49" class="t s2_49">Even his wives did not know anything about the room because he had never told anybody about it.</div>
<div id="tk_49" class="t s2_49">If somebody asked, he would smile and remain silent, and he would not give the key to anybody. All</div>
<div id="tl_49" class="t s2_49">the people were surprised about it, and their curiosity went on growing day by day – what does he</div>
<div id="tm_49" class="t s2_49">do there? Nobody knew! He used to stay in that closed room for one hour, then he would come out</div>
<div id="tn_49" class="t s2_49">silently and put the key in his pocket – and the next day he would do the same thing again. At last</div>
<div id="to_49" class="t s2_49">the people’s curiosity reached a peak and they conspired with each other to ﬁnd out what he was</div>
<div id="tp_49" class="t s2_49">doing. His ministers, his wives, his sons, his daughters were part of the conspiracy.</div>
<div id="tq_49" class="t s2_49">One night they made a hole in the wall so that they would be able to see what he was doing when</div>
<div id="tr_49" class="t s2_49">he next went there. The next day, when the emperor went inside, everybody peeped through the</div>
<div id="ts_49" class="t s2_49">hole one by one. But whoever put his eye to the hole immediately moved aside and said, ”What is</div>
<div id="tt_49" class="t s2_49">he doing? What is he doing?” But nobody could say what he was doing!</div>
<div id="tu_49" class="t s2_49">The emperor had gone inside and taken off all his clothes. And he spread his hands towards the</div>
<div id="tv_49" class="t s2_49">sky and said, ”O, God! The person who was wearing the clothes was not me. That is not my reality</div>
<div id="tw_49" class="t s2_49">– this is my reality!” And he started jumping and shouting and screaming abuses and behaving like</div>
<div id="tx_49" class="t s2_49">a madman.</div>
<div id="ty_49" class="t s2_49">Whoever looked through the hole moved aside immediately in shock and said, ”What is our emperor</div>
<div id="tz_49" class="t s2_49">doing? We used to think that perhaps he would be doing some yoga or saying some prayers. But</div>
<div id="t10_49" class="t s2_49">this! What is he doing?”</div>
<div id="t11_49" class="t s2_49">And the emperor said to God, ”The silent and peaceful-looking person who was in front of you in</div>
<div id="t12_49" class="t s2_49">clothes was absolutely false. He was a cultivated man. I made him like that through my efforts. In</div>
<div id="t13_49" class="t s2_49">reality I am like this. This is my reality, this is my nakedness and this is my madness! If you accept</div>
<div id="t14_49" class="t s2_49">my reality then it is alright – because I can deceive people but how can I deceive you? I can show</div>
<div id="t15_49" class="t s2_49">people that I am not naked by wearing clothes but you know very well that I am naked. How can I</div>
<div id="t16_49" class="t s2_49">deceive you? I can show to people that I am very silent and blissful, but you know me in my very</div>
<div id="t17_49" class="t s2_49">depth. How can I deceive you? In front of you I am just a mad man!”</div>
<div id="t18_49" class="t s2_49">The Inner Journey</div>
<div id="t19_49" class="t s2_49">49</div>
