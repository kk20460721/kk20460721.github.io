<div id="t1_220" class="t s1_220">So to prove to this man -- who was a professor of logic and never believed in </div>
<div id="t2_220" class="t s1_220">anything unless some evidence was produced -- I hypnotized his younger </div>
<div id="t3_220" class="t s1_220">brother. And I was surprised that even in the first sitting, he went so deep that </div>
<div id="t4_220" class="t s1_220">there was no need to have more sittings. I was thinking at least nine sittings and </div>
<div id="t5_220" class="t s1_220">then the experiment could be done. But he went so deep in the first sitting that I </div>
<div id="t6_220" class="t s1_220">told him, "Tomorrow, exactly at twelve o'clock -- and tomorrow is Sunday so I </div>
<div id="t7_220" class="t s1_220">will be at home, your brother will be at home, you will be at home -- don't go </div>
<div id="t8_220" class="t s1_220">anywhere. Exactly at twelve o'clock you have to kiss the same pillow you are </div>
<div id="t9_220" class="t s1_220">lying on right now. I am marking the place with a cross; exactly on that cross you </div>
<div id="ta_220" class="t s1_220">have to kiss." </div>
<div id="tb_220" class="t s1_220">I repeated it again and again and again. And when I became certain that it had </div>
<div id="tc_220" class="t s1_220">become an imprint in his unconscious mind, before waking him up I made a </div>
<div id="td_220" class="t s1_220">cross on the corner of his pillow with red ink. </div>
<div id="te_220" class="t s1_220">It took almost half an hour to bring him back, he had gone so deep. After waking </div>
<div id="tf_220" class="t s1_220">up, he became normal except for one thing; again and again he used to look at </div>
<div id="tg_220" class="t s1_220">the pillow and particularly at the cross. And then he would also feel embarrassed </div>
<div id="th_220" class="t s1_220">at what he was doing, because there was no reason to look at the pillow and at </div>
<div id="ti_220" class="t s1_220">the cross. His conscious mind was not aware at all, but his unconscious mind </div>
<div id="tj_220" class="t s1_220">was now projecting something of which he was not aware. </div>
<div id="tk_220" class="t s1_220">The next day, near about eleven-thirty, he became very restless. Something from </div>
<div id="tl_220" class="t s1_220">the unconscious was going on, telling him to do something which of course he </div>
<div id="tm_220" class="t s1_220">was thinking was insane ...to kiss. And I was present, his brother was present </div>
<div id="tn_220" class="t s1_220">and I had told his brother that he had to just sit and watch what happened. </div>
<div id="to_220" class="t s1_220">At eleven-fifty, I took the pillow, put it in my suitcase and locked it. And you </div>
<div id="tp_220" class="t s1_220">could see what was happening to that young boy ...tears flowing from his eyes. </div>
<div id="tq_220" class="t s1_220">And I asked, "What is the matter? Why you are crying?" </div>
<div id="tr_220" class="t s1_220">He said, "I don't know, but don't put my pillow in your suitcase. I beg you." </div>
<div id="ts_220" class="t s1_220">I said, "But what is wrong? I will give it back to you, by the evening when you go </div>
<div id="tt_220" class="t s1_220">to sleep." </div>
<div id="tu_220" class="t s1_220">He said, "No, I need it right now." </div>
<div id="tv_220" class="t s1_220">"What is the need?" </div>
<div id="tw_220" class="t s1_220">"I don't know any need. That is why I am crying, because I cannot give any </div>
<div id="tx_220" class="t s1_220">explanation, but I need the the pillow immediately." </div>
<div id="ty_220" class="t s1_220">So I gave him the key. He rushed -- because it was getting close to twelve -- he </div>
<div id="tz_220" class="t s1_220">opened the suitcase, took out the pillow and started kissing that cross almost like </div>
<div id="t10_220" class="t s1_220">mad. Just like any lover who has found his beloved after many years. </div>
<div id="t11_220" class="t s1_220">I asked him, his brother asked him, "What are you doing?" </div>
<div id="t12_220" class="t s1_220">He said, "I don't know, but I feel such a relief. Such a burden has been removed </div>
<div id="t13_220" class="t s1_220">from my heart. But I don't know what ...who has made this cross, why I have </div>
<div id="t14_220" class="t s1_220">such tremendous compulsion that if I don't kiss the cross I may die. I had to do it </div>
<div id="t15_220" class="t s1_220">exactly at twelve. That was coming from inside me and I don't know anything </div>
<div id="t16_220" class="t s1_220">about it." </div>
<div id="t17_220" class="t s1_220">His brother said, "I accept the evidence." </div>
