<div id="t2_144" class="t s1_144">....</div>
<div id="t3_144" class="t s1_144">This king was old and he was a great king, but in the world of Buddha </div>
<div id="t4_144" class="t s1_144">those things don't count, neither the age nor the money nor the kingdom. He was the </div>
<div id="t5_144" class="t s1_144">most junior because just that day he had taken sannyas, so he had to sleep in the porch </div>
<div id="t6_144" class="t s1_144">because there was no other place. </div>
<div id="t7_144" class="t s1_144">The king could not sleep; it was difficult, and one can understand his difficulty. He had </div>
<div id="t8_144" class="t s1_144">never slept in such a place. And you know Indian mosquitoes... and the king had never </div>
<div id="t9_144" class="t s1_144">experienced mosquitoes. And the ground was hard and the bhikkhus use no pillows, </div>
<div id="ta_144" class="t s1_144">just their hands, their arms. He tossed and turned but he could not go to sleep. </div>
<div id="tb_144" class="t s1_144">In the middle of the night he thought, "What have I done? This seems to be stupid! I </div>
<div id="tc_144" class="t s1_144">should be sleeping in my palace, I had everything. This seems to be pointless. </div>
<div id="td_144" class="t s1_144">Tomorrow morning the first thing I am going to do is to ask permission of the master: </div>
<div id="te_144" class="t s1_144">'Please excuse me. I cannot tolerate such unnecessary misery. I am going back to my </div>
<div id="tf_144" class="t s1_144">palace.'" </div>
<div id="tg_144" class="t s1_144">But in the middle of the night Buddha came out and he said, "Why wait for the </div>
<div id="th_144" class="t s1_144">morning? If you want to drop sannyas, drop it right now! Why suffer the whole night?" </div>
<div id="ti_144" class="t s1_144">The king was amazed. He had not said it to anybody -- there was nobody else, he was </div>
<div id="tj_144" class="t s1_144">alone in the porch. He said, "But how did you come to know? It was just a thought in </div>
<div id="tk_144" class="t s1_144">me." </div>
<div id="tl_144" class="t s1_144">Buddha said, "If your thoughts disappear you can start seeing others' thoughts because </div>
<div id="tm_144" class="t s1_144">others' thoughts are then like things. It is because of your thoughts that you cannot see </div>
<div id="tn_144" class="t s1_144">others' thoughts. You are so covered with your own thoughts that there is no space for </div>
<div id="to_144" class="t s1_144">others' thoughts. But you please go!" </div>
<div id="tp_144" class="t s1_144">The man said, "Now I cannot go. How can I leave such a master?" </div>
<div id="tq_144" class="t s1_144">Buddha said, "But my suggestion is still this, because you will again think of leaving. </div>
<div id="tr_144" class="t s1_144">You had better leave. Only one thing I have to remind you of: you took sannyas in your </div>
<div id="ts_144" class="t s1_144">past life too -- and the same difficulty was there, and you renounced sannyas. Now the </div>
<div id="tt_144" class="t s1_144">same difficulty has arisen and it will arise again and again. You have not learned </div>
<div id="tu_144" class="t s1_144">anything from your past life." </div>
<div id="tv_144" class="t s1_144">As Buddha was saying this, the man suddenly felt a tremendous upsurge of the </div>
<div id="tw_144" class="t s1_144">memories of the past life. He could see, he could remember that yes, this had happened. </div>
<div id="tx_144" class="t s1_144">The whole situation was the same. The master was different, the serai was different, the </div>
<div id="ty_144" class="t s1_144">mosquitoes must have been different, but the king was the same person and the </div>
<div id="tz_144" class="t s1_144">difficulty was the same. </div>
<div id="t10_144" class="t s1_144">The king said, "That's enough, now I am not going to leave; I am going to stick to it. </div>
<div id="t11_144" class="t s1_144">Now whatsoever happens</div>
<div id="t12_144" class="t s1_144">....</div>
<div id="t13_144" class="t s1_144">I have lived in palaces many times and I have not gained </div>
<div id="t14_144" class="t s1_144">anything so I am not going to waste this life anymore." </div>
<div id="t15_144" class="t s1_144">And he became enlightened one day. He persisted; a great perseverance must have </div>
<div id="t16_144" class="t s1_144">been needed. </div>
<div id="t17_144" class="t s1_144">HE HAS COME TO THE END OF THE WAY, Buddha says, OVER THE RIVER OF HIS </div>
<div id="t18_144" class="t s1_144">MANY LIVES, HIS MANY DEATHS. </div>
