<div id="t1_120" class="t s1_120">Patanjali is very logical, logical in the world of the mysterious. Step by step he </div>
<div id="t2_120" class="t s1_120">moves, analytical. He could have satisfied any Einstein, any Wittgenstein or </div>
<div id="t3_120" class="t s1_120">Russell. Lao Tzu could not have satisfied Einstein, he could not have satisfied </div>
<div id="t4_120" class="t s1_120">Russell or Wittgenstein, because he would have looked absurd. He was talking </div>
<div id="t5_120" class="t s1_120">patent nonsense. But Patanjali would have satisfied any scientific mind, </div>
<div id="t6_120" class="t s1_120">howsoever great, because he talked so scientifically and he moves so gradually, </div>
<div id="t7_120" class="t s1_120">step by step, showing every link. </div>
<div id="t8_120" class="t s1_120">The teachings are different because Patanjali was born in India, was talking to </div>
<div id="t9_120" class="t s1_120">Indians -- a very contemplative country. Lao Tzu was talking to mystics, a very </div>
<div id="ta_120" class="t s1_120">meditative country in those days. Both were talking to different people; different </div>
<div id="tb_120" class="t s1_120">types of disciples gathered around them. Teaching differs because teaching is for </div>
<div id="tc_120" class="t s1_120">the taught. Teachers don't differ. If you leave Patanjali alone and Lao Tzu alone </div>
<div id="td_120" class="t s1_120">they will be just the same, but if Patanjali is with his students and Lao Tzu with </div>
<div id="te_120" class="t s1_120">his disciples, they will be different. If Patanjali and Lao Tzu are silent, they are </div>
<div id="tf_120" class="t s1_120">the same, but if they talk to somebody they will be different. A teacher has to </div>
<div id="tg_120" class="t s1_120">teach according to the disciple -- his understanding, his training, his aptitude, his </div>
<div id="th_120" class="t s1_120">intelligence, his conditioning. He has to bring his teaching to the level of the </div>
<div id="ti_120" class="t s1_120">student; otherwise he is not a teacher. That's why teachings differ. </div>
<div id="tj_120" class="t s1_120">And one more thing: there are two types of people. One, who are very, very </div>
<div id="tk_120" class="t s1_120">courageous and crazy take the jump; in fact, dangerously courageous, irrational. </div>
<div id="tl_120" class="t s1_120">In a certain mood they can take the jump; they don't bother about the </div>
<div id="tm_120" class="t s1_120">consequence. And then there is another type of person -- hesitating, will make </div>
<div id="tn_120" class="t s1_120">every certainty about what is going to happen, about the consequence and the </div>
<div id="to_120" class="t s1_120">result; only then will he move. Patanjali has appeal to those who would like to be </div>
<div id="tp_120" class="t s1_120">convinced before the jump. Lao Tzu is for those who don't bother for any </div>
<div id="tq_120" class="t s1_120">conviction; they are ready to jump. For these tWo different types two different </div>
<div id="tr_120" class="t s1_120">teachings exist, but the teachers are the same. </div>
<div id="ts_120" class="t s1_120">The third part: "And why has there not been a Master before you in all the ages </div>
<div id="tt_120" class="t s1_120">who has combined and synthesized all the teachings of past Buddhas?" </div>
<div id="tu_120" class="t s1_120">There was no need; now the need exists. The world was, in the past, divided. The </div>
<div id="tv_120" class="t s1_120">world was very, very big. People remained confined in their own countries. </div>
<div id="tw_120" class="t s1_120">Teachings were not meeting: a Mohammedan lived like a Mohammedan, never </div>
<div id="tx_120" class="t s1_120">aware of what the Vedas say; a Hindu lived like a Hindu, never knowing really </div>
<div id="ty_120" class="t s1_120">what Zarathustra has taught. But now the world has become very small, a global </div>
<div id="tz_120" class="t s1_120">village; the world has shrunken tremendously. Now everybody knows </div>
<div id="t10_120" class="t s1_120">everything else: a Christian is not just a Christian -- he knows what the Geeta </div>
<div id="t11_120" class="t s1_120">says, he knows what the Koran says. Now there is confusion; because the Koran </div>
<div id="t12_120" class="t s1_120">says something, the Geeta says something, the Bible says something else. Now </div>
<div id="t13_120" class="t s1_120">everybody is aware of everything else that is around. People go on moving from </div>
<div id="t14_120" class="t s1_120">one country to another country, from one teacher to another teacher. There are </div>
<div id="t15_120" class="t s1_120">many here who have been with many teachers; now they are a mess. </div>
