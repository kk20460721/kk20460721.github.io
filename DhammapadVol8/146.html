<div id="t2_146" class="t s1_146">Let him insult you, let him finish first. Then you close your eyes and wait for five </div>
<div id="t3_146" class="t s1_146">minutes, and watch what is happening inside you -- anger boiling." </div>
<div id="t4_146" class="t s1_146">Gurdjieff himself became enlightened through this simple procedure: that whatsoever is </div>
<div id="t5_146" class="t s1_146">mechanical in man he tried to make it nonmechanical. And all is mechanical in you -- </div>
<div id="t6_146" class="t s1_146">anger, lust, greed, jealousy -- all is mechanical. It simply is there whenever somebody </div>
<div id="t7_146" class="t s1_146">pushes a button. You are functioning like a robot. Become a man. </div>
<div id="t8_146" class="t s1_146">That's what meditation is all about, that's what sannyas is all about. Create a little </div>
<div id="t9_146" class="t s1_146">distance. Next time somebody insults you, give it five minutes, sit silently for five </div>
<div id="ta_146" class="t s1_146">minutes, and then you can become angry. I am not saying "Don't become angry" -- </div>
<div id="tb_146" class="t s1_146">because that will be too much. I am saying that just for five minutes allow a gap, and </div>
<div id="tc_146" class="t s1_146">you will be surprised: after five minutes it is not the same anger that it would have been </div>
<div id="td_146" class="t s1_146">five minutes before. </div>
<div id="te_146" class="t s1_146">Dale Carnegie remembers an incident in his life. He delivered a radio broadcast on </div>
<div id="tf_146" class="t s1_146">Abraham Lincoln. He mentioned a few wrong facts about Lincoln; even his birthdate </div>
<div id="tg_146" class="t s1_146">was wrong. He received one letter, a very angry letter, from a woman, calling him a </div>
<div id="th_146" class="t s1_146">fool, calling him stupid. "If you don't even know the right birthdate, what right have </div>
<div id="ti_146" class="t s1_146">you got to speak on Abraham Lincoln?" </div>
<div id="tj_146" class="t s1_146">He became enraged, and he immediately wrote an angry answer. But it was too late in </div>
<div id="tk_146" class="t s1_146">the day, so he thought, "Tomorrow morning I will post the letter." </div>
<div id="tl_146" class="t s1_146">Before posting it he read the letter again. It looked too angry -- twelve hours had </div>
<div id="tm_146" class="t s1_146">passed. He read the woman's letter; it was not so insulting as it had appeared at the first </div>
<div id="tn_146" class="t s1_146">glance. So he changed his letter, he wrote it again. When he was writing it again he said, </div>
<div id="to_146" class="t s1_146">"Why not wait twenty-four hours more and see what happens? What is the hurry? The </div>
<div id="tp_146" class="t s1_146">woman is not going to die." </div>
<div id="tq_146" class="t s1_146">So he waited twenty-four hours and read his letter again. Now he was even more cool, </div>
<div id="tr_146" class="t s1_146">and still the letter looked a little too strong. He changed it and thought, "Why not wait </div>
<div id="ts_146" class="t s1_146">forty-eight hours? Let it be an experiment! I can always send the letter, but after twelve </div>
<div id="tt_146" class="t s1_146">hours I had to change it, after twenty-four hours I had to change it much more. Let us </div>
<div id="tu_146" class="t s1_146">see what happens after forty-eight hours." </div>
<div id="tv_146" class="t s1_146">After forty-eight hours he had to change it totally. All anger had disappeared. He said, </div>
<div id="tw_146" class="t s1_146">"Now I will wait two days more and then I will send it." </div>
<div id="tx_146" class="t s1_146">And when finally he wrote the letter he apologized; he was no longer angry. The </div>
<div id="ty_146" class="t s1_146">woman was right: what right has he if he does not know the facts? At least he should </div>
<div id="tz_146" class="t s1_146">have checked the facts before going to broadcast. It was absolutely right on her part to </div>
<div id="t10_146" class="t s1_146">get angry. </div>
<div id="t11_146" class="t s1_146">So he wrote, "You are perfectly right. Next time I will not commit such a mistake. I am </div>
<div id="t12_146" class="t s1_146">deeply sorry that I hurt your feelings. I apologize. If any time you happen to be in this </div>
<div id="t13_146" class="t s1_146">city, please come to see me, or, if I come to your town, I will come to see you. I would </div>
<div id="t14_146" class="t s1_146">like to know more about Lincoln -- because I feel you know more than I know." </div>
<div id="t15_146" class="t s1_146">Naturally, the woman was tremendously impressed by the humbleness of the man; she </div>
<div id="t16_146" class="t s1_146">was not expecting that he would be so humble. Next time she came to that town where </div>
