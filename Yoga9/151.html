<div id="t3_151" class="t s1_151">Maitreya came to me through him, but he is a very sensitive soul. And I say to him that </div>

<div id="t7_151" class="t s1_151">Once a great politician died and his ghost decided to go along to the funeral -- to his own </div>

<div id="td_151" class="t s1_151">The politician's desire is a very childish desire: to look big and great in the eyes of others. </div>
<div id="te_151" class="t s1_151">Easy to achieve because the masses are simply mad. You just have to know how to </div>

<div id="tm_151" class="t s1_151">Just think about it ill this way, be a little arithmetical. If one fool claps his hands in </div>
