<div id="t4_123" class="t s1_123">Cautiously he climbed up to the second-floor balcony. Peering through a locked </div>
<div id="t5_123" class="t s1_123">window, he saw a baby in its crib. By this time he was quite desperate so he decided to </div>

<div id="tb_123" class="t s1_123">You have all become knowledgeable. You know nothing and yet you are full of </div>
<div id="tc_123" class="t s1_123">knowledge. Your knowledge simply covers your ignorance, it does not make you wise. </div>
<div id="td_123" class="t s1_123">It simply makes your foolishness a little decorated, a little polished. </div>
<div id="te_123" class="t s1_123">A troubled young man went to see a doctor. The doctor told him to take off his clothes </div>

<div id="tm_123" class="t s1_123">You ask me, "Can innocence in an adult happen without awareness?" </div>
<div id="tn_123" class="t s1_123">It is impossible. The beginning of innocence in an adult is to be aware that you are </div>

<div id="tx_123" class="t s1_123">humanity and I am against the past. I am not here supporting Indian culture. So that is </div>
<div id="ty_123" class="t s1_123">not a criticism of me -- in fact, that is a compliment! </div>
<div id="tz_123" class="t s1_123">I am against all that is dead. One should not carry dead bodies for ever and ever, they </div>
