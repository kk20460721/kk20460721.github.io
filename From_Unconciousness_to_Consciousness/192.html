<div id="t1_192" class="t s1_192">CHAPTER 17. THE IMMACULATE DECEPTION</div>
<div id="t2_192" class="t s2_192">You ask me, ”Why did all the holy books have to create the concept of the devil?”</div>
<div id="t3_192" class="t s2_192">The arithmetic is very simple. The arithmetic is that you cannot create God without creating the devil.</div>
<div id="t4_192" class="t s2_192">It is absolutely necessary for God’s existence, because where are you going to dump everything that</div>
<div id="t5_192" class="t s2_192">is wrong in the world? If only God is there then he is responsible for everything – for Buchenwald, or</div>
<div id="t6_192" class="t s2_192">any other concentration camp of Adolf Hitler, where millions of Jews are just gassed; within seconds</div>
<div id="t7_192" class="t s2_192">they evaporate.</div>
<div id="t8_192" class="t s2_192">After the second world war, when it was discovered, nobody could believe their eyes. Even Germans</div>
<div id="t9_192" class="t s2_192">could not believe it because they were not aware of what was happening. Millions of skeletons...</div>
<div id="ta_192" class="t s2_192">everything had been taken away from them. Even if they had a tooth covered with gold, that had</div>
<div id="tb_192" class="t s2_192">been taken out; that was more precious than the life of the man. And before they were sent into the</div>
<div id="tc_192" class="t s2_192">gas chamber they were destroyed completely as far as their identity, individuality is concerned.</div>
<div id="td_192" class="t s2_192">First they had to undress and be naked; then their hair, beard, mustaches were shaved completely.</div>
<div id="te_192" class="t s2_192">Those who have survived somehow say that they could not believe, when they looked into the mirror,</div>
<div id="tf_192" class="t s2_192">that ”This is me.” Everything had been taken away. Naked they were standing there, shaved, and</div>
<div id="tg_192" class="t s2_192">they were told that they are going to have a bath – just for hygiene and cleanliness. When they</div>
<div id="th_192" class="t s2_192">entered those gas chambers they were going to take a bath; that was what was told to them. They</div>
<div id="ti_192" class="t s2_192">never came out to tell others that there was no bath. Once you are inside the chambers, suddenly</div>
<div id="tj_192" class="t s2_192">you are gone within seconds. It was an oven to burn people alive – and so fast and so efﬁcient. You</div>
<div id="tk_192" class="t s2_192">can understand: German efﬁciency, German bureaucracy. It must have been really tight, because</div>
<div id="tl_192" class="t s2_192">millions of people died and nobody in the country even heard the rumor that this was happening.</div>
<div id="tm_192" class="t s2_192">And the people who were doing it were doing a holy job, because to them Adolf Hitler was the</div>
<div id="tn_192" class="t s2_192">incarnation of Elijah. He was a prophet, ”So whatsoever he is doing is right. It must be God’s will</div>
<div id="to_192" class="t s2_192">that Jews are no longer needed.” So they were perfectly righteous about what they were doing.</div>
<div id="tp_192" class="t s2_192">They never felt that they were committing any crime; they were simply following the orders from the</div>
<div id="tq_192" class="t s2_192">prophet. And his book was holy: to the Nazi, Adolf Hitler’s book My Struggle is as holy as The Bible</div>
<div id="tr_192" class="t s2_192">to the Christians, and the Vedas to the Hindus. And whatsoever Adolf Hitler says is the word of God.</div>
<div id="ts_192" class="t s2_192">But why, you ask, is the devil needed? It is very simple. To whom are you going to delegate all</div>
<div id="tt_192" class="t s2_192">the wrong that is happening in the world, that continues to increase: the suffering, the misery, the</div>
<div id="tu_192" class="t s2_192">anguish? If God alone is there, then of course he is the only source of all responsibility. To save</div>
<div id="tv_192" class="t s2_192">him from all this responsibility, the poor devil</div>
<div id="tw_192" class="t s2_192">....</div>
<div id="tx_192" class="t s2_192">So the ﬁrst ﬁction is God, and to keep him clean and</div>
<div id="ty_192" class="t s2_192">good – he is the good guy – you need a bad guy in contrast. And you can dump everything wrong</div>
<div id="tz_192" class="t s2_192">on the bad guy: it is the devil.</div>
<div id="t10_192" class="t s2_192">In Germany Adolf Hitler was the prophet of God; in England he was the devil. Mothers used to make</div>
<div id="t11_192" class="t s2_192">their children afraid. If they were playing outside and their mother did not want them to stay outside,</div>
<div id="t12_192" class="t s2_192">just one thing was enough: ”Adolf Hitler is coming” – and they would run in. Adolf Hitler in England,</div>
<div id="t13_192" class="t s2_192">and in every other country wherever he has invaded or was trying to invade, was the devil incarnate.</div>
<div id="t14_192" class="t s2_192">All the religions need the devil. It is a safety for God. Adam and Eve fell from grace, committed the</div>
<div id="t15_192" class="t s2_192">original sin because of the devil. Otherwise, God was so good: he had given them all. He had given</div>
<div id="t16_192" class="t s2_192">them good advice – what to eat, what not to eat – and he was taking care of them, but this devil</div>
<div id="t17_192" class="t s2_192">disturbed it. And still, whatsoever goes wrong anywhere, it is the devil who disturbs.</div>
<div id="t18_192" class="t s2_192">From Unconciousness to Consciousness</div>
<div id="t19_192" class="t s2_192">192</div>
<div id="t1a_192" class="t s3_192">Osho</div>
