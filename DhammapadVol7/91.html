<div id="t1_91" class="t s1_91">is easy to attain. It is very easy to become dead, and very difficult to be overflowing </div>
<div id="t2_91" class="t s1_91">with life. </div>
<div id="t3_91" class="t s1_91">That's why millions of monks and nuns have followed a false path -- they have become </div>
<div id="t4_91" class="t s1_91">silent. You can go to the monasteries and you will find people who are silent, but their </div>
<div id="t5_91" class="t s1_91">silence has the taste of death. Their silence is not the silence of a song, of a dance; their </div>
<div id="t6_91" class="t s1_91">silence is not divine. In fact they have fallen rather than risen higher, soaring upwards. </div>
<div id="t7_91" class="t s1_91">They have fallen so much, they have become just dead rocks. Their silence has not been </div>
<div id="t8_91" class="t s1_91">a transformation, it has been a suicide. And because it has not been a soaring up high, </div>
<div id="t9_91" class="t s1_91">you will find all kinds of foolishnesses still in it, waiting for their opportunity, for their </div>
<div id="ta_91" class="t s1_91">moment to explode. </div>
<div id="tb_91" class="t s1_91">The foolish person can become silent. It may deceive many, they may think, "He has </div>
<div id="tc_91" class="t s1_91">arrived." But he is simply hiding his foolishness, his stupidity, his unconsciousness </div>
<div id="td_91" class="t s1_91">behind a beautiful facade of silence. </div>
<div id="te_91" class="t s1_91">An ancient Sufi parable says: </div>
<div id="tf_91" class="t s1_91">Four persons decided to go into silence. They moved into a cave; they wanted to live in </div>
<div id="tg_91" class="t s1_91">silence for three months, because they had heard so much about it -- they had become </div>
<div id="th_91" class="t s1_91">so much intrigued. They were so ambitious to gain something out of it. It was not </div>
<div id="ti_91" class="t s1_91">understanding that had brought them to the cave. It was greed, it was desire, ambition. </div>
<div id="tj_91" class="t s1_91">Hence within minutes everything was exposed. Just within minutes the first man said, </div>
<div id="tk_91" class="t s1_91">"I wonder whether I have put the candle out or not? It will be a sheer wastage, there is </div>
<div id="tl_91" class="t s1_91">nobody in the house." </div>
<div id="tm_91" class="t s1_91">The second one said, "You fool! You have spoken! And we have taken the vow of </div>
<div id="tn_91" class="t s1_91">silence." </div>
<div id="to_91" class="t s1_91">The third one laughed and said, "You are a greater fool! If he had spoken, what was the </div>
<div id="tp_91" class="t s1_91">need for you to speak?" </div>
<div id="tq_91" class="t s1_91">And the fourth one said, "Thank God, I am the only one who has not spoken yet." </div>
<div id="tr_91" class="t s1_91">Just by being silent nothing changes, you remain the same. Transformation comes </div>
<div id="ts_91" class="t s1_91">through awareness. Awareness brings a silence of its own, very alive, throbbing with </div>
<div id="tt_91" class="t s1_91">eternity, full of a song. It is not sad and not serious because it is not dead, it has a dance </div>
<div id="tu_91" class="t s1_91">to it. It is tremendously beautiful, it is positive, existential. It does not make you just a </div>
<div id="tv_91" class="t s1_91">hollow thing. It makes you so full that you start overflowing with joy. You become so </div>
<div id="tw_91" class="t s1_91">fulfilled that you cannot contain your contentment within yourself, you have to share it. </div>
<div id="tx_91" class="t s1_91">You become a cloud full of rainwater. You have to shower it. </div>
<div id="ty_91" class="t s1_91">But out of a hundred so-called seekers, it is only once in a while that a rare seeker comes </div>
<div id="tz_91" class="t s1_91">to know the difference between the real silence and the unreal silence. How can the fool </div>
<div id="t10_91" class="t s1_91">within you be dropped by being silent? Yes, it will not be expressed, but it will be there. </div>
<div id="t11_91" class="t s1_91">In fact it will become more and more powerful -- unexpressed it will accumulate </div>
<div id="t12_91" class="t s1_91">energy. And any moment, any opportunity, and you will show it; you will be unable to </div>
<div id="t13_91" class="t s1_91">hide it forever. </div>
