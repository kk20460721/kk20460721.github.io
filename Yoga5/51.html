<div id="t1_51" class="t s1_51">It happened: A Sufi mystic, Junnaid, was passing through a forest. He saw a man </div>
<div id="t2_51" class="t s1_51">walking there, just on the bank of a deep lake. The man was completely drunk, a </div>
<div id="t3_51" class="t s1_51">bottle in his hand, and he was wavering like a drunkard -- and any moment he </div>
<div id="t4_51" class="t s1_51">could fall in the lake, and it was dangerous. So Junnaid reached him, took his </div>
<div id="t5_51" class="t s1_51">hand in his hand and said, "Friend, what are you doing? This is dangerous. </div>
<div id="t6_51" class="t s1_51">Walking here, so drunk, you can fall. And the lake is very deep, and there is </div>
<div id="t7_51" class="t s1_51">nobody around here. Even if you shout and cry, nobody will hear." </div>
<div id="t8_51" class="t s1_51">The drunkard opened his eyes and said, "Junnaid, you may not be knowing me, </div>
<div id="t9_51" class="t s1_51">but I know you. What you are saying to me I would like to say to you also: that if </div>
<div id="ta_51" class="t s1_51">I fall, at the most -- at the most -- my body will be harmed, but if you fall, then </div>
<div id="tb_51" class="t s1_51">your whole consciousness</div>
<div id="tc_51" class="t s1_51">....</div>
<div id="td_51" class="t s1_51">" </div>
<div id="te_51" class="t s1_51">Junnaid went back to his disciples, and he said. "I found a Master today." </div>
<div id="tf_51" class="t s1_51">And he was right, the drunkard was right, because Junnaid was on the peak, </div>
<div id="tg_51" class="t s1_51">moving at the peak of consciousness -- if he falls from there everything will be </div>
<div id="th_51" class="t s1_51">shattered. The higher you move, greater is the danger. People who walk on plane </div>
<div id="ti_51" class="t s1_51">ground, even if they fall, what is going to happen? At the most, a little fracture </div>
<div id="tj_51" class="t s1_51">like Teertha. So they go to the hospital and they can be bandaged. But if you </div>
<div id="tk_51" class="t s1_51">move on the heights, then danger is very much. </div>
<div id="tl_51" class="t s1_51">Because you are Buddhas, that's why you have fallen in so much ignorance, in </div>
<div id="tm_51" class="t s1_51">the so deep valley of darkness. So don't be depressed about it. If you are so deep </div>
<div id="tn_51" class="t s1_51">in the valley, that is just an indication that again you can be at the peaks. The </div>
<div id="to_51" class="t s1_51">very possibility of falling happens because of the capacity to be on the peak. And </div>
<div id="tp_51" class="t s1_51">it is good -- nothing is wrong -- because it is an experience. Your Buddhahood </div>
<div id="tq_51" class="t s1_51">will become more clear. When you have passed through this darkness and </div>
<div id="tr_51" class="t s1_51">suffering, and when you come back home, you will not be the same as you were </div>
<div id="ts_51" class="t s1_51">before you fell. Your intensity of awareness will have a different quality now: </div>
<div id="tt_51" class="t s1_51">you have suffered and you have known. You will be more alert. Your awareness </div>
<div id="tu_51" class="t s1_51">will now be more alert, intense, integrated, crystallized. </div>
<div id="tv_51" class="t s1_51">It happened: A very rich man became frustrated with his riches -- as it happens. </div>
<div id="tw_51" class="t s1_51">In fact this should be the criterion of whether a man is rich or not. If a man is </div>
<div id="tx_51" class="t s1_51">really rich he is bound to be frustrated with his riches. If he is not yet frustrated </div>
<div id="ty_51" class="t s1_51">he is still a poor man; he may have money, but he is not rich -- because a rich </div>
<div id="tz_51" class="t s1_51">man is bound to know that whatsoever he has has not satisfied him a bit. The </div>
<div id="t10_51" class="t s1_51">deep anxiety, emptiness, follows him; now it is even more intense -- a clarity has </div>
<div id="t11_51" class="t s1_51">come. A poor man can always hope that tomorrow will be good. How can a rich </div>
<div id="t12_51" class="t s1_51">man hope? Tomorrow is going to be the same. The hope is dead. He has all that </div>
<div id="t13_51" class="t s1_51">he can have; tomorrow is not going to add anything more. An Andrew Carnegie </div>
<div id="t14_51" class="t s1_51">-- when he died he left thousands of millions of dollars. What can tomorrow </div>
<div id="t15_51" class="t s1_51">add? A few thousand more? A few million more? But he cannot use those few </div>
<div id="t16_51" class="t s1_51">million because right now he does not know what to do with his money. He has </div>
<div id="t17_51" class="t s1_51">already more than is needed. </div>
