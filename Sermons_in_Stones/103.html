<div id="t1_103" class="t s1_103">CHAPTER 7. LOVE AND CENTERING: ONE PHENOMENON</div>
<div id="t2_103" class="t s2_103">He could not show anything – the box was empty. There was no way to materialize the biological</div>
<div id="t3_103" class="t s2_103">energy, but he gathered every possible evidence.</div>
<div id="t4_103" class="t s2_103">Somebody was suffering from impotence. Wilhelm Reich would put him in the box and his impotence</div>
<div id="t5_103" class="t s2_103">would disappear, at least for a few days, as if his battery had been recharged. It was an indirect</div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s2_103">proof but something had happened. In the box, something had happened, the box was not empty.</div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s2_103">He told lovers, ”Even without loving, you can simply lie down, cuddling, melting into each other.”</div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s2_103">His work was strange, hard... and it was made more difﬁcult by the society because they started</div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s2_103">immediately condemning him, saying that he was in conspiracy with the devil – just like me! – saying</div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s2_103">that sex had to be renounced and he was teaching people some strange exercises.</div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s2_103">Those strange exercises show his genius. He had no idea of tantra, he had never been to the East.</div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s2_103">But the exercises that he found are ten thousand years old. He discovered them and thousands</div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s2_103">of witnesses who were healed by him... because soon he started healing other patients, not only</div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s2_103">the sexual ones. Because sex energy is pure energy, it can be converted into many forms. It can</div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s2_103">become your intelligence, it can become your silence. He started treating people.</div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s2_103">The treatment was simple: he would just put them in the box. They would remain for ﬁfteen minutes</div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s2_103">or twenty minutes, a few sessions – and they were cured. But medical sicence was against him</div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s2_103">because ”this man cannot practice medicine.”</div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s2_103">This is how law is blind. This man cured thousands of people of strange diseases which were not</div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s2_103">curable by ordinary, ofﬁcial medicine but that couldn’t be counted. The question was whether he</div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s2_103">had a registration: ”Is he licensed to practice?”</div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s2_103">Wilhelm Reich said, ”I don’t use medicine, I don’t prescribe anything. My whole medicine is the box.</div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s2_103">If you accept it as medicine, then the medical faculties of your universities have to prove what kind</div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s2_103">of medicine is there. When I tell you to look into what I have found, you think I am crazy and when I</div>
<div id="tp_103" class="t s2_103">cure people, then I am criminal. I have not harmed anybody.”</div>
<div id="tq_103" class="t s2_103">But medical science, the Christian Church, the government – all started many cases against him.</div>
<div id="tr_103" class="t s2_103">You can start any case – it may be absolutely false, unfounded, but you can harass the person for</div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s2_103">years. So many cases... and the man became so tense and there was nobody to support him, not</div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s2_103">even the people of his own profession. They were against him because their psychoanalysis would</div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s2_103">die if his energy box succeeded.</div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s2_103">Medicine is not ready to accept somebody who has no medical certiﬁcates. His friends left him. He</div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s2_103">was in great agony because he knew he had found something of great value for humanity and he</div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s2_103">also saw that he could not convince anybody. He was only convincing people that he was crazy.</div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s2_103">People were simply laughing, making cartoons, bringing court cases against him.</div>
<div id="tz_103" class="t s2_103">Finally he was jailed because he was practicing medicine without a license. Now you see the tricky</div>
<div id="t10_103" class="t s2_103">world. He was not practicing medicine, he was practicing healing – that you can say, but you cannot</div>
<div id="t11_103" class="t s2_103">say he was practicing medicine. He had not harmed anybody, and he was ready to cooperate with</div>
<div id="t12_103" class="t s2_103">any research group. He was available to talk about everything he had discovered.</div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s2_103">Sermons in Stones</div>
<div id="t14_103" class="t s2_103">103</div>
<div id="t15_103" class="t s3_103">Osho</div>
