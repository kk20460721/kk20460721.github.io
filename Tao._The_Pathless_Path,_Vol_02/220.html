<div id="t2_220" class="t s2_220">Tell your heart. Tell what you have experienced in your life. Would it not be a great desire in your</div>
<div id="t3_220" class="t s2_220">heart also that if you were born again and life was again given to you. you would like to start it as</div>
<div id="t4_220" class="t s2_220">a sannyasin? Wouldn’t it be good for a change, at least? Just think over it. If your boy becomes</div>
<div id="t5_220" class="t s2_220">convinced by you, take him with all my blessings But if he is not convinced, don’t go in anger. Then</div>
<div id="t6_220" class="t s2_220">too go on loving him. Let him do what he wants to do. Let him have his own life experience in his</div>
<div id="t7_220" class="t s2_220">own way. Who knows?</div>
<div id="t8_220" class="t s2_220">When Buddha left his palace his father was worried. And when he became enlightened and came</div>
<div id="t9_220" class="t s2_220">back after twelve years his father was very angry – naturally. This was his only son born when the</div>
<div id="ta_220" class="t s2_220">father was very old. He was a gift of God. He was the only heir to the kingdom and he had left the</div>
<div id="tb_220" class="t s2_220">old man. To whom was this kingdom going to belong? There was nobody to look after it – and the</div>
<div id="tc_220" class="t s2_220">old man was eighty years old.</div>
<div id="td_220" class="t s2_220">When the son came back of course the father was angry. He came to the door and he said, ’I am</div>
<div id="te_220" class="t s2_220">your father. I still feel for you although I know you have done a foolish thing. But you are not meant to</div>
<div id="tf_220" class="t s2_220">be a beggar, a sannyasin, you are an emperor’s son and you are meant to be an emperor. You come</div>
<div id="tg_220" class="t s2_220">back. I am angry but I am your father, I can forgive you. You come back. Drop all this nonsense</div>
<div id="th_220" class="t s2_220">and disperse all these sannyasins, these mad people, who are following you. Their mothers and</div>
<div id="ti_220" class="t s2_220">fathers must be suffering like me. I have not slept for twelve years. I could not sleep. It has been a</div>
<div id="tj_220" class="t s2_220">nightmare. You have hurt me very deeply.’</div>
<div id="tk_220" class="t s2_220">Buddha was standing there. The father was very angry He went on shouting at him until ﬁnally he</div>
<div id="tl_220" class="t s2_220">cooled down a little Then Buddha said, ’Sir, you don’t see that I am not the same person who left the</div>
<div id="tm_220" class="t s2_220">palace. Look at me. I am a totally new being. I am not the same person who left the palace, who</div>
<div id="tn_220" class="t s2_220">used to be your son. My body may look the same but look deep into me. Something has happened.</div>
<div id="to_220" class="t s2_220">And I have come just to show my gratitude to you, to show I am happy that I was born to you, that</div>
<div id="tp_220" class="t s2_220">you gave me birth. I have attained and I have come hare my experience with you. In your old age I</div>
<div id="tq_220" class="t s2_220">would like you also to attain – because death is coming. I can see your legs are shaking, you cannot</div>
<div id="tr_220" class="t s2_220">stand rightly Death is coming. Before death comes, know what truth is, know what life is. Before</div>
<div id="ts_220" class="t s2_220">death comes, realise yourself.’</div>
<div id="tt_220" class="t s2_220">The father looked. Certainly this was not the same man although he looked the same. This ﬁgure</div>
<div id="tu_220" class="t s2_220">was luminous, a great light had happened to him. The father cooled down, he meditated over it, he</div>
<div id="tv_220" class="t s2_220">thought about it again and again and he found that it was right. His reaction was just a reaction,</div>
<div id="tw_220" class="t s2_220">an unconscious reaction.</div>
<div id="tx_220" class="t s2_220">Finally he himself became a meditator.</div>
<div id="ty_220" class="t s2_220">Eventually, before he died, he</div>
<div id="tz_220" class="t s2_220">became a BHIKKHU, he became a sannyasin.</div>
<div id="t10_220" class="t s2_220">Your responsibility is great, but don’t just react out of unawareness. Give the boy a chance also. He</div>
<div id="t11_220" class="t s2_220">may be right. Think from his side too. Always remember that truth is nobody’s monopoly and truth</div>
<div id="t12_220" class="t s2_220">has nothing to do with age. Sometimes a small child has it and sometimes an old man does not</div>
<div id="t13_220" class="t s2_220">have it. And whenever you say something remember not to Judge.</div>
<div id="t14_220" class="t s2_220">Just a few days before, something happened. Old Paritosh had written a journal, a beautiful journal.</div>
<div id="t15_220" class="t s2_220">I have looked into it and many other sannyasins have looked into it – and we have many talented</div>
<div id="t16_220" class="t s2_220">people around here, authors, poets, published novelists. They have all looked at it and they liked it.</div>
<div id="t17_220" class="t s2_220">So he sent it to a friend who is a publisher in England.</div>
<div id="t18_220" class="t s2_220">Tao: The Pathless Path, Vol 2</div>
<div id="t19_220" class="t s2_220">220</div>
