<div id="t1_147" class="t s1_147">Dale Carnegie lived she phoned him. He went, received her, invited her for a dinner. </div>
<div id="t2_147" class="t s1_147">And finally the woman and he became so friendly, they fell in love! </div>
<div id="t3_147" class="t s1_147">It looks like a fairy tale -- does not happen in real life! In real life only tragedies happen. </div>
<div id="t4_147" class="t s1_147">But we are responsible for all those tragedies because of our unawareness. </div>
<div id="t5_147" class="t s1_147">So the first thing I will suggest, Shivananda, is that if you want to know what </div>
<div id="t6_147" class="t s1_147">unawareness is, allow a gap. This is the process of de-automatization. You have become </div>
<div id="t7_147" class="t s1_147">automatic, you function automatically. You have to reverse the whole process, de-</div>
<div id="t8_147" class="t s1_147">automatize it, slowly slowly, in small matters. </div>
<div id="t9_147" class="t s1_147">For example, you have gone for a walk. Don't walk the same way as you walk every </div>
<div id="ta_147" class="t s1_147">day. Go slow or go fast, but don't just repeat the same routine. And you will be </div>
<div id="tb_147" class="t s1_147">surprised: if you go slow you are more aware, if you go faster you are more aware; if </div>
<div id="tc_147" class="t s1_147">you go exactly the same speed as you follow every day, you lose all awareness. </div>
<div id="td_147" class="t s1_147">Buddha told his disciples to walk very slowly, as slowly as possible. Try it and you will </div>
<div id="te_147" class="t s1_147">be surprised. A great awareness arises if you walk very slowly. You speak in a certain </div>
<div id="tf_147" class="t s1_147">way; one day try to speak in some other way. Speak slowly, and you will be surprised </div>
<div id="tg_147" class="t s1_147">that the slowness of the speech makes you alert. Suddenly something is changed, </div>
<div id="th_147" class="t s1_147">because you are not functioning according to the robot. </div>
<div id="ti_147" class="t s1_147">Mind has two parts: one is the learning part, the other is the robot part. The learning </div>
<div id="tj_147" class="t s1_147">part learns; whenever you are learning something you are more aware. For example, if </div>
<div id="tk_147" class="t s1_147">you are learning driving you are more aware -- you have to be. The moment you have </div>
<div id="tl_147" class="t s1_147">learned it, the learning part gives its information to the robot part. Once you have </div>
<div id="tm_147" class="t s1_147">learned driving, then you don't need any awareness; you simply go on doing it </div>
<div id="tn_147" class="t s1_147">mechanically. You turn towards your house, you arrive in your garage, you lock the car. </div>
<div id="to_147" class="t s1_147">You are doing everything like a robot. </div>
<div id="tp_147" class="t s1_147">And this is the story of your life, twenty-four hours a day. Change it! </div>
<div id="tq_147" class="t s1_147">Gurdjieff's method was this: if some vegetarian had come to him as a disciple, the first </div>
<div id="tr_147" class="t s1_147">thing he would insist was, "Eat meat!" Now this is a very shocking thing for a </div>
<div id="ts_147" class="t s1_147">vegetarian -- to be told to eat meat. And Gurdjieff was a tough master; he would throw </div>
<div id="tt_147" class="t s1_147">you out if you didn't listen to him, if you didn't follow the command, if you didn't </div>
<div id="tu_147" class="t s1_147">follow the discipline. He would force you to eat meat. Now, when a vegetarian eats </div>
<div id="tv_147" class="t s1_147">meat he becomes very conscious -- he has to. He has no idea in the past, no experience </div>
<div id="tw_147" class="t s1_147">in the past, of eating meat. Just think of Mahatma Gandhi eating meat... he will become </div>
<div id="tx_147" class="t s1_147">tremendously aware! </div>
<div id="ty_147" class="t s1_147">And if there was a meat-eater, then Gurdjieff would say, "For a few weeks you be just </div>
<div id="tz_147" class="t s1_147">vegetarian. Don't eat meat at all -- no eggs, no meat, no milk, no animal food of any </div>
<div id="t10_147" class="t s1_147">kind. Just go on eating vegetables." The whole body system had become accustomed to </div>
<div id="t11_147" class="t s1_147">a certain pattern. He would change people's eating hours. If you were eating every day </div>
<div id="t12_147" class="t s1_147">at one o'clock, he would say, "Eat at nine." If you were going to sleep every day at </div>
<div id="t13_147" class="t s1_147">twelve, he would say to go at two or at ten. He would change everything. A man who </div>
<div id="t14_147" class="t s1_147">had never been drinking wine, he would force to drink wine just to change and shatter </div>
<div id="t15_147" class="t s1_147">his pattern. The man who had been a drunkard, he would stop him from drinking. </div>
