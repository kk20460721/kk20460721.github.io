<div id="t2_9" class="t s1_9">farther and farther away from the truth. </div>
<div id="t3_9" class="t s1_9">Hence I don't tell my sannyasins to renounce, although renunciation happens. Many of </div>
<div id="t4_9" class="t s1_9">my sannyasins write to me, "Beloved Master, you deceived us. We were thinking </div>
<div id="t5_9" class="t s1_9">nothing has to be renounced, and now many things are simply disappearing." </div>
<div id="t6_9" class="t s1_9">Just the other day there was a letter. One sannyasin has written that his sexual desire </div>
<div id="t7_9" class="t s1_9">has completely disappeared -- and he had tried his whole life to renounce it and he had </div>
<div id="t8_9" class="t s1_9">never succeeded. And here we are not teaching to renounce anything, not even sexual </div>
<div id="t9_9" class="t s1_9">desire, so his letter has a relevance. He says, "You tricked us. I was thinking that I have </div>
<div id="ta_9" class="t s1_9">come here to enjoy my sexual desire for the first time, because the whole life I have been </div>
<div id="tb_9" class="t s1_9">trying to be a monk. Tired of it, utterly a failure in renouncing it, I had come here -- and </div>
<div id="tc_9" class="t s1_9">now it has disappeared!" </div>
<div id="td_9" class="t s1_9">This is beautiful, if it has disappeared on its own accord. If you have not dropped it, it </div>
<div id="te_9" class="t s1_9">won't come back again. If you have dropped it, it is bound to come back again because </div>
<div id="tf_9" class="t s1_9">dropping it simply means repressing it. Dropping does not mean anything else; it </div>
<div id="tg_9" class="t s1_9">simply means you have repressed it forcibly. Sooner or later, in some weaker moment, </div>
<div id="th_9" class="t s1_9">it will be back again -- and with a vengeance. But if it drops on its own... you have not </div>
<div id="ti_9" class="t s1_9">done anything to drop it, not even a decision; you have not willfully acted on it, it is </div>
<div id="tj_9" class="t s1_9">through understanding. Seeing the futility of it, seeing that it does not fulfill, that it is a </div>
<div id="tk_9" class="t s1_9">kind of a toy</div>

<div id="tm_9" class="t s1_9">You can remain engaged in it, it keeps you occupied. It keeps you so </div>
<div id="tn_9" class="t s1_9">much occupied that you don't have any time to look inwards. But it never takes you </div>

<div id="tt_9" class="t s1_9">monastery what else is there to enjoy? Of course it will be just fantasy. Fantasy is </div>
<div id="tu_9" class="t s1_9">personal pornography. Nobody else can see what you are seeing and you can go on </div>
<div id="tv_9" class="t s1_9">giggling and enjoying. You can go on reading the Bible, the Koran, so everybody thinks </div>
<div id="tw_9" class="t s1_9">how religious you are, how pious -- and nobody knows what you are really doing </div>
<div id="tx_9" class="t s1_9">inside. </div>
<div id="ty_9" class="t s1_9">The so-called religious people are very pornographic; they are bound to be. The more </div>

<div id="t15_9" class="t s1_9">In the Middle Ages the nuns were reporting in thousands that the Devil comes and </div>

<div id="t17_9" class="t s1_9">The ordinary devils are enough. But those nuns, they were imagining. And when for </div>
