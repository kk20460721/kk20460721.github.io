<div id="t1_21" class="t s1_21">yourself. Or you send your child to tell the visitor that "Daddy is not at home." </div>
<div id="t2_21" class="t s1_21">But if somebody gives you a call on the phone then you are not disturbed. Then </div>
<div id="t3_21" class="t s1_21">you immediately pick up the phone, because the reality is so far away. </div>
<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">Once it happened that a thief entered somebody's house and was caught -- </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">caught because of an old habit. The phone was ringing. He could not resist, he </div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">had to answer it. A phone has to be answered! So he picked up the phone and he </div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s1_21">was caught. When he was asked, "Why did you bother?" he said, "I completely </div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s1_21">forgot that I was a thief in the house. When the phone rings, one has to answer." </div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">One man was doing some research work on this phenomenon. He called twenty </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">public phones and somebody or the other answered. Then he inquired of the </div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s1_21">man: "Why did you answer? It was not for you." </div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s1_21">The man said, "I was just passing." </div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">"Then why did you answer?" </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s1_21">He said, "But the phone was ringing!" </div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">It has a certain power. When the phone rings you have to answer. It has a certain </div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s1_21">quality about it, something hypnotic. You are not concerned with the phone, it is </div>
<div id="th_21" class="t s1_21">certain that it is not ringing for you. It is a public phone; you pass by it while you </div>
<div id="ti_21" class="t s1_21">are going to your office. It is certain that it is not ringing for you. Why do you </div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">answer it? </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">When the reality is far away, it is very easy to answer. When the reality comes </div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s1_21">nearer, it becomes more and more difficult. The greatest difficulties of life are </div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s1_21">concerned with the people who are very real to you and very near to you: your </div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s1_21">wife, your children, your husband. They are very close, they are real. There is the </div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s1_21">trouble. </div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s1_21">You may have liked Zorba. Even Kazantzakis liked the man -- when he was not </div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">with him! But when they lived together it was really difficult. Sometimes he </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">would come home drunk, and he would start dancing and would dance the </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">whole night. And he was a powerful man -- very strong. When you live with </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">such a man it will be very difficult, unless you yourself are such a man. </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">Don't create substitutes. That's a trick of the mind to deceive you. Love the real, </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">don't love the phony. It is better to love than to write poetry about love. Love </div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">will transform you, love will give you insight. Love will give you insight into the </div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s1_21">human heart -- into your own and into the other's. Through love there will be </div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">many unhappy moments, anguish, but there will be peaks of joy also. And that's </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">how one grows: through the night of anguish, then through the day of joy. One </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">moves through the duality: it is a dialectical process. </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">Just reading poetry about love is so convenient, but don't think that you really </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">love. Reading poetry about love is very easy because nothing is at stake. </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">Leo Tolstoy has written in his memoirs that when he was a small child his </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">mother used to go to the theater. They were very rich people; they belonged to </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">the royal family. In Moscow the snow would be falling -- a winter night -- and </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">the mother and the child would be in the theater. </div>
