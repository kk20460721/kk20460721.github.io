<div id="t2_103" class="t s1_103">conditioned to deny, you have been conditioned to say 'no'. You have not yet </div>
<div id="t3_103" class="t s1_103">known how to say 'yes'. You have been conditioned to condemn. You were </div>
<div id="t4_103" class="t s1_103">condemned and the same you are doing to others. You go on condemning </div>
<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">yourself also, and of course the same you have to do with others. You cannot do </div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">otherwise. </div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s1_103">Your parents were telling you, 'You are wrong, this is not right, this should never </div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s1_103">be done,' and a thousand and one times they have repeated it. And you have </div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s1_103">gathered one message: that you are not accepted as you are, you are not loved for </div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s1_103">your simple being. </div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s1_103">If you fulfill their desires they love you; their love is a bargain. If you follow </div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s1_103">them like shadows, they appreciate, they approve. If you just become a little free </div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s1_103">and you try to be an individual, they are against you -- their eyes, their </div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">behaviour, everything changes. And every child is so helpless -- just to survive </div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">he has to be political, he has to accept whatsoever the parents are saying. </div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">Then there is society, then there is the establishment of education. And by and by </div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">you go deeper and deeper into the mess, and everybody is there to force you to </div>
<div id="ti_103" class="t s1_103">follow him. Then there are priests and politicians, all do-gooders, and they all </div>
<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">want you to follow them, and they all have trained you. Your mind is a </div>
<div id="tk_103" class="t s1_103">conditioned mind. That's why you cannot accept yourself and you cannot accept </div>
<div id="tl_103" class="t s1_103">others. </div>
<div id="tm_103" class="t s1_103">But the possibility exists. If you understand this -- that this is just conditioning -- </div>
<div id="tn_103" class="t s1_103">you can drop out of it clean, right now! Don't get identified with it, that is the </div>
<div id="to_103" class="t s1_103">only way. Don't think that this is you; just remember that this is society speaking </div>
<div id="tp_103" class="t s1_103">through you. Don't call it your conscience, it is not your conscience. It is a </div>
<div id="tq_103" class="t s1_103">pseudo-conscience created by the society. It is a trick, it is a very dangerous trick. </div>
<div id="tr_103" class="t s1_103">But the society has put inside you its own ideas and they function as your </div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s1_103">conscience. In fact, they don't allow your real conscience to surface, they don't </div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s1_103">allow your own consciousness to come and take charge of your life. </div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s1_103">Society is very political. Outside it has posted the policeman and the magistrate; </div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">inside it has posted the conscience. That is the inner policeman, the inner </div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">magistrate. And it is not even satisfied with this arrangement -- above it has </div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">posted a god, the super-policeman, the head constable. So he is looking from </div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">there; even in your bathroom he is watching you. Somebody is following you </div>

<div id="t11_103" class="t s1_103">others. It has been given so early that you don't remember, but it is a political </div>
<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">arrangement. It is not religious. </div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">Religion is an unconditioning. The very process of religion is to make you </div>
