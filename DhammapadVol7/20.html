<div id="t2_20" class="t s1_20">the inexpressible. </div>
<div id="t3_20" class="t s1_20">Just put the human mind aside. And by that I mean, put the past aside and the future, </div>
<div id="t4_20" class="t s1_20">and look. This very moment... and the whole heaven descends upon you. You are </div>
<div id="t5_20" class="t s1_20">overwhelmed. The birds are singing and their songs are fresh; they are not repeating </div>
<div id="t6_20" class="t s1_20">old songs. They have no idea of yesterdays and they are not singing for the future. They </div>
<div id="t7_20" class="t s1_20">are not rehearsing for tomorrows. And the trees are fresh. All is fresh except man. </div>
<div id="t8_20" class="t s1_20">So don't ask, "From where does freshness come?" Ask, "From where does this dullness </div>
<div id="t9_20" class="t s1_20">come, this staleness, this deadness?" Because this deadness comes and goes. Freshness </div>
<div id="ta_20" class="t s1_20">is always there -- it is the very nature of existence. It is God's presence. </div>
<div id="tb_20" class="t s1_20">Meditation is nothing but a way, a method, to connect you with the eternal, to take you </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s1_20">beyond time, beyond that which is born and dies, to take you beyond all the </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s1_20">boundaries, to take you to the inconceivable and the unknowable. And it is not far </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s1_20">away; it is as close as it can be. Even to say that it is close is not right, because it is </div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s1_20">exactly your very being, it is you. Freshness is your soul. </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s1_20">Your mind is boring, utterly boring. Get out of the mind. At least for a few moments </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s1_20">every day, put the mind aside, be utterly nude of the mind. And then you will know it </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s1_20">is welling up within you -- the freshness you are asking about. From where does it </div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s1_20">come? It comes from the deepest core of your being -- and it does not really come. </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s1_20">Suddenly you find it has always been the case. It has always been there like an </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s1_20">undercurrent, underground, hidden behind many many layers of memories, dreams, </div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s1_20">desires. </div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s1_20">Buddha says: Be desireless and know. Be desireless, and you will reach to the realm </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s1_20">which is beyond birth and death, and you will enter into the unbounded. </div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s1_20">But why is man not going into his own being which is so close? He is ready to go to the </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s1_20">moon, he is ready to go anywhere! He is ready to go to the stars, but not into his own </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s1_20">being. Why? There must be some deep reason behind it. The reason is: to go within </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s1_20">yourself you will have to lose yourself. And one is afraid of losing oneself. One clings, </div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s1_20">one wants to remain oneself. One does not want to lose one's identity. It is a very poor </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s1_20">identity and false too, but still, something is better than nothing. That is our logic. </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s1_20">We don't know who we are, so we cling to the body, to the mind, to whatsoever has </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s1_20">been given to us -- the conditioning, Catholic, communist, Hindu, Mohammedan. We </div>

<div id="t12_20" class="t s1_20">consciousness cannot be confined to such stupid labels. Your consciousness is so </div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s1_20">infinite, it cannot be contained in any word. It is as vast as the sky itself. </div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s1_20">But you are afraid to go into that vastness. That vastness appears like emptiness, void. </div>
<div id="t15_20" class="t s1_20">And one clings to one's own small, arbitrary identity. Hence the fear of going into </div>
<div id="t16_20" class="t s1_20">oneself. </div>
