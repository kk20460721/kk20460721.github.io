<div id="t1_61" class="t s1_61">My father said, "That means I will have to withdraw the case and lose that valuable piece</div>
<div id="t2_61" class="t s1_61">of land!"</div>
<div id="t3_61" class="t s1_61">He said, "What can be done about it? Your son is going to create trouble for you, and</div>
<div id="t4_61" class="t s1_61">seeing the situation, that he will not in any way be persuaded, I have agreed with him -- just to</div>
<div id="t5_61" class="t s1_61">make his position stronger so that you can withdraw; it is better to withdraw than to get</div>
<div id="t6_61" class="t s1_61">defeated."</div>
<div id="t7_61" class="t s1_61">My father said, "But this is a strange family! I am working for you all. I am working for</div>
<div id="t8_61" class="t s1_61">you, I am working for my son -- I am not working for myself. If we can have a beautiful shop</div>
<div id="t9_61" class="t s1_61">on that land you will have a better, more comfortable old age; he will have a better education</div>
<div id="ta_61" class="t s1_61">in a better university. And you are against me."</div>
<div id="tb_61" class="t s1_61">My grandfather said, "I am not against anybody, but he has taken my promise, and I cannot</div>
<div id="tc_61" class="t s1_61">go against my word -- at least as far as he is concerned -- because he is dangerous, he may put</div>
<div id="td_61" class="t s1_61">me in some trouble. So I cannot deceive him; I will say whatever he is saying. And he is</div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s1_61">saying the truth -- and you know it."</div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s1_61">So my father had to withdraw the case -- reluctantly ... but he had to withdraw the case. I</div>
<div id="tg_61" class="t s1_61">asked my grandfather to bring some sweets so we can distribute them in the neighborhood.</div>
<div id="th_61" class="t s1_61">My father has come to his senses, it has to be celebrated. He said, "That seems to be the right</div>
<div id="ti_61" class="t s1_61">thing to do."</div>
<div id="tj_61" class="t s1_61">When my father saw that I was distributing sweets, he asked, "What are you doing? -- for</div>
<div id="tk_61" class="t s1_61">what? What has happened?"</div>
<div id="tl_61" class="t s1_61">I said, "You have come back to your senses. Truth is victorious." And I gave him a sweet</div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s1_61">also.</div>
<div id="tn_61" class="t s1_61">He laughed. He said, "I can understand your standpoint, and my own father is with you, so</div>
<div id="to_61" class="t s1_61">I thought it is better that I should also be with you. It is better to withdraw without any</div>
<div id="tp_61" class="t s1_61">problem. But I have learned a lesson." He said to me, "I cannot depend on my family. If there</div>
<div id="tq_61" class="t s1_61">is any trouble they are not going to support me just because they belong to me as father, as</div>
<div id="tr_61" class="t s1_61">son, as brother. They are going to support whatever is true."</div>
<div id="ts_61" class="t s1_61">And since that time no other situation ever arose, because he never did anything in which</div>
<div id="tt_61" class="t s1_61">we had to disagree. He remained truthful and sincere.</div>
<div id="tu_61" class="t s1_61">Many times in his life he told me, "It was so good of you; otherwise I was going to take</div>
<div id="tv_61" class="t s1_61">that land, and I would have committed a crime knowingly. You prevented me, and not only</div>
<div id="tw_61" class="t s1_61">from that crime, you prevented me from then onwards. Whenever there was a similar</div>
<div id="tx_61" class="t s1_61">situation, I always decided in favor of truth, whatever the loss. But now I can see: truth is the</div>
<div id="ty_61" class="t s1_61">only treasure. You can lose your whole life, but don't lose your truth."</div>
<div id="tz_61" class="t s1_61">This is what I want you to learn from Ta Hui's teachings: to experiment in seeing what is</div>
<div id="t10_61" class="t s1_61">right and why it is right, what is wrong and why it is wrong, and also to know that even right</div>
<div id="t11_61" class="t s1_61">becomes wrong when it comes from a wrong mind, from a wrong person.</div>
<div id="t12_61" class="t s1_61">Truth needs to be born out of an experience of truthfulness. It is a very delicate flower but</div>
<div id="t13_61" class="t s1_61">the most precious treasure in life, because it brings liberation, it brings freedom, it brings to</div>
<div id="t14_61" class="t s1_61">you your own immortality.</div>
<div id="t15_61" class="t s1_61">But never be a borrower, never depend on the other's knowledge. A small piece of your</div>
<div id="t16_61" class="t s1_61">own experience is far more important than all the VEDAS, all the KORANS, all the BIBLES,</div>
<div id="t17_61" class="t s1_61">Chapter 4 - Trust</div>
<div id="t18_61" class="t s1_61">Osho - The Great Zen Master Ta Hui</div>
