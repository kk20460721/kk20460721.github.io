<div id="t2_180" class="t s1_180">mechanism, the most beautiful mechanism in existence, but you have become a servant </div>
<div id="t3_180" class="t s1_180">to the mind. You are the master and the master is functioning as a servant; the mind is a </div>
<div id="t4_180" class="t s1_180">servant and you have made the servant the master. </div>
<div id="t5_180" class="t s1_180">I have heard an ancient story: </div>
<div id="t6_180" class="t s1_180">A king was very happy with one of his servants. He was so devoted, so totally devoted </div>
<div id="t7_180" class="t s1_180">to the king; he was always ready to sacrifice his life for the king. The king was </div>
<div id="t8_180" class="t s1_180">immensely happy, and many times he has saved the king, risking his own life. He was </div>
<div id="t9_180" class="t s1_180">the king's bodyguard. </div>
<div id="ta_180" class="t s1_180">One day the king was feeling so happy with the man, he said, "If you desire anything, if </div>
<div id="tb_180" class="t s1_180">you have any desire, just tell me and I will fulfill it. You have done so much for me that </div>
<div id="tc_180" class="t s1_180">I can never show my gratitude, I can never repay you, but today I would like to fulfill </div>
<div id="td_180" class="t s1_180">any of your wishes whatsoever it is." </div>
<div id="te_180" class="t s1_180">The servant said, "You have already given me too much. I am so blessed just by being </div>
<div id="tf_180" class="t s1_180">always with you -- I don't need anything." </div>
<div id="tg_180" class="t s1_180">But the king insisted. The more the servant said, "There is no need," the more the king </div>
<div id="th_180" class="t s1_180">insisted. Finally the servant said, "Then it's okay. You make me the king for twenty-four </div>
<div id="ti_180" class="t s1_180">hours and you be the guard." </div>
<div id="tj_180" class="t s1_180">The king was a little apprehensive, afraid, but he was a man of his word and he had to </div>
<div id="tk_180" class="t s1_180">fulfill the desire. So for twenty-four hours he became the guard and the guard became </div>
<div id="tl_180" class="t s1_180">the king. And do you know what the guard did? The first thing that he did, he ordered </div>
<div id="tm_180" class="t s1_180">the king to be killed, sentenced to death! </div>
<div id="tn_180" class="t s1_180">The king said, "What are you doing?" </div>
<div id="to_180" class="t s1_180">He said, "You keep quiet! You are simply the guard and nothing more. It is my wish </div>
<div id="tp_180" class="t s1_180">and now I am the king!" </div>
<div id="tq_180" class="t s1_180">The king was killed, and the servant became the king forever. </div>
<div id="tr_180" class="t s1_180">Servants have their own devious ways to become masters. </div>
<div id="ts_180" class="t s1_180">The mind is one of the most beautiful, the most complex, the most evolved mechanisms. </div>
<div id="tt_180" class="t s1_180">It has served you well, it serves you well. Because of its services you have repeated the </div>
<div id="tu_180" class="t s1_180">same story in your life, everybody has repeated the same story: you have made the </div>
<div id="tv_180" class="t s1_180">mind the master and now the master treats you just like a servant. </div>
<div id="tw_180" class="t s1_180">This is the problem, not that the mind has to be thrown out. If you throw the mind out </div>
<div id="tx_180" class="t s1_180">you will go insane. Without the mind there is only one profession you can be in: that is </div>
<div id="ty_180" class="t s1_180">politics! </div>
<div id="tz_180" class="t s1_180">I have heard: </div>
<div id="t10_180" class="t s1_180">One politician was going through a brain operation. His brain was taken out, they were </div>
<div id="t11_180" class="t s1_180">fixing his brain and he was lying on the stretcher waiting. </div>
<div id="t12_180" class="t s1_180">Suddenly a man came in and said, "What are you doing here? You have been chosen the </div>
<div id="t13_180" class="t s1_180">prime minister of the country!" </div>
<div id="t14_180" class="t s1_180">So he got up. The surgeon said, "Where are you going? -- your brain is here!" </div>
