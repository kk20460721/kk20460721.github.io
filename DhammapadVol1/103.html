<div id="t5_103" class="t s1_103">dimensionally religious it has suffered much. And now the West is suffering much, and </div>
<div id="t6_103" class="t s1_103">the cause is one-dimensionality. The West is bankrupt as far as the inner world is </div>
<div id="t7_103" class="t s1_103">concerned and the East is bankrupt as far as the outer world is concerned. </div>
<div id="t8_103" class="t s1_103">The East is not accidentally poor and starving. It has chosen to be that way. It has </div>
<div id="t9_103" class="t s1_103">denied science; it has even denied the world of objective reality. It says the world is </div>
<div id="ta_103" class="t s1_103">illusory. If the world is illusory, how can you create a science? The very first </div>
<div id="tb_103" class="t s1_103">requirement is missing. You cannot create a science out of maya, illusion. How can you </div>
<div id="tc_103" class="t s1_103">create a science out of something which is not, which does not even exist? If you deny </div>
<div id="td_103" class="t s1_103">the world, you have denied the dimension of science altogether. </div>
<div id="te_103" class="t s1_103">That is the reason why the East is poor and starving. And unless the Eastern genius </div>
<div id="tf_103" class="t s1_103">understands this, we can go on importing science from the West but it will not get roots </div>
<div id="tg_103" class="t s1_103">into our beings. If our approach remains the same as it has been for five thousand years, </div>
<div id="th_103" class="t s1_103">science will only be something foreign. That's how it is. </div>

<div id="tj_103" class="t s1_103">very unscientific life. He may be consulting the palmist and the astrologer. He may be </div>

<div id="tr_103" class="t s1_103">reduced first to an animal and now to a machine. Man loses all glory, all grandeur. Man </div>
<div id="ts_103" class="t s1_103">loses all hope, all future. The moment man loses his interiority he loses depth, he </div>
<div id="tt_103" class="t s1_103">becomes superficial. The Western man is rich as far as things are concerned, but is very </div>
<div id="tu_103" class="t s1_103">poor as far as soul is concerned -- inwardly poor, outwardly rich. </div>
<div id="tv_103" class="t s1_103">This is the state of affairs right now. </div>
<div id="tw_103" class="t s1_103">And between these two a few artists exist who have something of both the dimensions. </div>
<div id="tx_103" class="t s1_103">But even the artist is not satisfied, because he is something of both but he is neither a </div>
<div id="ty_103" class="t s1_103">scientist nor a religious person -- just having a few glimpses of both the worlds. He </div>
<div id="tz_103" class="t s1_103">remains in a kind of limbo; he never settles, he remains a vagabond. He moves like a </div>

<div id="t12_103" class="t s1_103">contribute religiously. At the most his art remains decorative; at the most it can make </div>
<div id="t13_103" class="t s1_103">life a little more beautiful, a little more comfortable, convenient. But that is not much. </div>
<div id="t14_103" class="t s1_103">I propose the fourth way. The true man will be all three simultaneously: he will be a </div>
<div id="t15_103" class="t s1_103">scientist, an artist, and religious. And I call the fourth man the spiritual man. That's </div>
<div id="t16_103" class="t s1_103">where I differ from Albert Einstein and Gautam Buddha and Picasso -- from them all. </div>
