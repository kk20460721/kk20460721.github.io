<div id="t1_26" class="t s1_26">So the first thing to understand about a problem is that it should be existential, not </div>
<div id="t2_26" class="t s1_26">theological, speculative, philosophical. It should be psychological rather than being </div>
<div id="t3_26" class="t s1_26">philosophical, and it should come out of confrontation with life. </div>
<div id="t4_26" class="t s1_26">Ninety percent of your problems arise because you are caught in dead thoughts, and you </div>
<div id="t5_26" class="t s1_26">cling to those thoughts. When a situation arises which doesn't fit with your-thought, the </div>
<div id="t6_26" class="t s1_26">problem arises -- and you want to try changing the situation rather than changing the </div>
<div id="t7_26" class="t s1_26">thought. If you come across a situation which doesn't fit with yom ideology, you struggle </div>
<div id="t8_26" class="t s1_26">hard to change the situation rather than to change the ideology. Then the problem arises. </div>
<div id="t9_26" class="t s1_26">Always be ready to change your mind because life cannot be changed just because of </div>
<div id="ta_26" class="t s1_26">your ideologies. And we have learned ways how to look at life, how to interpret life, and </div>
<div id="tb_26" class="t s1_26">we become fixated in certain routines. </div>
<div id="tc_26" class="t s1_26">Let me tell you one anecdote. </div>
<div id="td_26" class="t s1_26">A mousy little man used to be very frightened of his boss. One day he told a fellow </div>
<div id="te_26" class="t s1_26">worker that he was sick. </div>
<div id="tf_26" class="t s1_26">His friend said, "Why don't you go home?" </div>
<div id="tg_26" class="t s1_26">"Oh, I couldn't do that!" </div>
<div id="th_26" class="t s1_26">"Why not? Don't be silly, he will never know. He is not even here today." </div>
<div id="ti_26" class="t s1_26">Finally the man was convinced and went home. </div>
<div id="tj_26" class="t s1_26">When he got there, he looked in the window -- and there was his boss, kissing and </div>
<div id="tk_26" class="t s1_26">hugging his wife. So he ran all the way back to the office. "A fine friend you are!" he said </div>
<div id="tl_26" class="t s1_26">to his pal. "I nearly got caught." </div>
<div id="tm_26" class="t s1_26">Just an old pattern of thought. The situation was totally different. He could have caught </div>
<div id="tn_26" class="t s1_26">the boss, but just the old idea that always the boss has been catching him. </div>
<div id="to_26" class="t s1_26">Watch life and don't be addicted to your mind. Ninety percent of your problems will </div>
<div id="tp_26" class="t s1_26">disappear simply without any bother. Ten percent of your problems will remain, they are </div>
<div id="tq_26" class="t s1_26">existential; and they are needed to be there because you have to grow through them. If </div>
<div id="tr_26" class="t s1_26">they are dropped you will not grow. The conflict is needed. The pain is needed. The </div>
<div id="ts_26" class="t s1_26">suffering is needed. Because that will make you crystallized, that will make you more </div>
<div id="tt_26" class="t s1_26">aware. And if you can transcend it you will have earned the bliss that comes after one has </div>
<div id="tu_26" class="t s1_26">transcended a problem. </div>
<div id="tv_26" class="t s1_26">It is just like mountaineering. You are going up, uphill, tired, perspiring, breathing is </div>
<div id="tw_26" class="t s1_26">difficult, seems impossible to reach the top; and then you reach the top and you lie down </div>
<div id="tx_26" class="t s1_26">under the sky and you rest and you are relaxed and you are happy that you decided to </div>
<div id="ty_26" class="t s1_26">climb. But only after a hard climb. You can reach that top by a helicopter, but then you </div>
<div id="tz_26" class="t s1_26">have not earned it. So a man who reaches to the top by the helicopter and the man who </div>
<div id="t10_26" class="t s1_26">moves on his feet reach to different peaks. They never reach to the same peak. Your </div>
<div id="t11_26" class="t s1_26">means change your end. The man who has dropped by helicopter will enjoy it a little; he </div>
<div id="t12_26" class="t s1_26">will say, "Yes, it is beautiful." But his enjoyment will be like a man who is completely </div>
<div id="t13_26" class="t s1_26">stuffed with food and then a delicious plate comes before him; he says, "Good," he can </div>
<div id="t14_26" class="t s1_26">smell it a little, but he is so stuffed he has no appetite. And just by his side there is </div>
<div id="t15_26" class="t s1_26">another man who is hungry. </div>
<div id="t16_26" class="t s1_26">To reach to the top one needs to have the appetite also; and that appetite grows while you </div>
<div id="t17_26" class="t s1_26">are climbing. You become more and more hungry, you become more and more tired, you </div>
