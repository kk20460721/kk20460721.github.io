<div id="t2_52" class="t s1_52">single suspicion, that they were perfectly right. "This man is dangerous. To </div>
<div id="t3_52" class="t s1_52">destroy this man is to save the society." And of course whenever there is such an </div>
<div id="t4_52" class="t s1_52">alternative -- that you can save the whole society by killing one man -- the </div>
<div id="t5_52" class="t s1_52">murder is worth it. The priests killed him because of their goodness, because of </div>
<div id="t6_52" class="t s1_52">their virtue, because of their m orality. They killed him in the name of God; they </div>
<div id="t7_52" class="t s1_52">killed him very innocently. </div>
<div id="t8_52" class="t s1_52">This situation has been arising again and again in history. There seems to be no </div>
<div id="t9_52" class="t s1_52">possibility to change it. The only possibility is that Jesus should be so moderate </div>
<div id="ta_52" class="t s1_52">that he doesn't hurt anybody. But then he is useless. He could have managed -- </div>
<div id="tb_52" class="t s1_52">you ask me rightly. He could have managed, he could have been very moderate </div>
<div id="tc_52" class="t s1_52">and liberal. He could have talked like a politician who talks much but never says </div>
<div id="td_52" class="t s1_52">anything, who says many things but is always vague. He never clearly asserts </div>
<div id="te_52" class="t s1_52">anything; you can never pinpoint what he has said. </div>
<div id="tf_52" class="t s1_52">The crime of Jesus was that he was clear, certain: that whatsoever he was saying, </div>
<div id="tg_52" class="t s1_52">he was not saying like a politician. He was opening his heart. He was not </div>
<div id="th_52" class="t s1_52">diplomatic. If he had diluted his teaching there would have been no trouble. But </div>
<div id="ti_52" class="t s1_52">then there would have been no Christ also. And that would have been a greater </div>
<div id="tj_52" class="t s1_52">murder. Then the Christ would have committed suicide. </div>
<div id="tk_52" class="t s1_52">As I see it, as things are, this is the only way it could have been. Jesus had to be </div>
<div id="tl_52" class="t s1_52">as hard as he was, had to be as rebellious as he was. He could not dilute his </div>
<div id="tm_52" class="t s1_52">message and he could not compromise. </div>
<div id="tn_52" class="t s1_52">The priests would have been happy if he himself had become a rabbi, a priest. </div>
<div id="to_52" class="t s1_52">Then there would have been no trouble. If he had just kept himself within the </div>
<div id="tp_52" class="t s1_52">imprisonment of the tradition, if he had not tried to open new dimensions to </div>
<div id="tq_52" class="t s1_52">humanity, there would have been no trouble. Then they would have worshipped </div>
<div id="tr_52" class="t s1_52">him, loved him, sanctified him as a saint. They would have remembered him. </div>
<div id="ts_52" class="t s1_52">But he tried to open up new dimensions. That was moving in danger. But that </div>
<div id="tt_52" class="t s1_52">danger was worth taking. If Jesus was crucified it is nothing to be worried about. </div>
<div id="tu_52" class="t s1_52">That was the only way. He pushed humanity to a higher level of being and </div>
<div id="tv_52" class="t s1_52">consciousness. </div>
<div id="tw_52" class="t s1_52">It is not that he tried to manage in any way to be murdered. There was no need. </div>
<div id="tx_52" class="t s1_52">Priests are enough; you need not provoke them. They will be provoked </div>
<div id="ty_52" class="t s1_52">automatically, they move in a mechanical way. There was no need to provoke </div>
<div id="tz_52" class="t s1_52">them -- the very being of Jesus was enough. </div>
<div id="t10_52" class="t s1_52">You recoil from the whole idea of crucifixion because you cannot understand. It </div>
<div id="t11_52" class="t s1_52">is not an ordinary murder. It is meaningful, it is significant. It has done much: it </div>
<div id="t12_52" class="t s1_52">has created something new that never existed before. Through that crucifixion, </div>
<div id="t13_52" class="t s1_52">Jesus changed almost half of humanity, forced them to move on a different path </div>
<div id="t14_52" class="t s1_52">than they had ever moved on. </div>
<div id="t15_52" class="t s1_52">When you think about crucifixion you become afraid, as if you are being </div>
<div id="t16_52" class="t s1_52">crucified. You don't know that Jesus cannot be crucified. Only his body' not him. </div>
