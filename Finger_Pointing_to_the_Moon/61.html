<div id="t1_61" class="t s1_61">CHAPTER 5. LET GO AND FLY</div>
<div id="t2_61" class="t s2_61">hurt that I cannot sleep the whole night.” For example, he said, ”I had gone to a shop to buy some</div>
<div id="t3_61" class="t s2_61">material. I wanted to buy some material, but I did not like what the shopkeeper had showed me. The</div>
<div id="t4_61" class="t s2_61">shopkeeper said, ’Leave it. I knew when I ﬁrst saw your face that you would not buy any.’ I could not</div>
<div id="t5_61" class="t s2_61">sleep that night, trying to work out why this shopkeeper spoke like that.”</div>
<div id="t6_61" class="t s2_61">Our ego is dependent on what others say. The people all around us either contribute to our ego</div>
<div id="t7_61" class="t s2_61">or they take away some of it. This is why we are concerned the whole time as to what people are</div>
<div id="t8_61" class="t s2_61">saying or thinking about us. That is our capital. Collecting others’ opinions contributes to our pride</div>
<div id="t9_61" class="t s2_61">– but what is the reliability of others’ opinions? Their opinions are in their hands. Today they may</div>
<div id="ta_61" class="t s2_61">be extending it in our favor, tomorrow they may not. Today they may have a good opinion of us,</div>
<div id="tb_61" class="t s2_61">tomorrow they may have a bad one – and they have their own motivations.</div>
<div id="tc_61" class="t s2_61">That shopkeeper had his own motivations. He gave a hit to the ego. Now two things could have</div>
<div id="td_61" class="t s2_61">happened through it. One was that this man might have purchased the material, just to save face</div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s2_61">if for nothing else. And it would have been better if he had made a purchase, for at least he would</div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s2_61">have saved himself from a whole night’s sleeplessness. But then another worry would have gripped</div>
<div id="tg_61" class="t s2_61">the mind – ”Why did I buy the cloth which I did not want?” And you all have bought many such items</div>
<div id="th_61" class="t s2_61">that you never wanted to buy, but on many occasions your ego goads you to buy.</div>
<div id="ti_61" class="t s2_61">In the West, salesmen are slowly being replaced in shops by saleswomen. Now there are no more</div>
<div id="tj_61" class="t s2_61">salesmen, only saleswomen! Now there is no sense in keeping the word salesman in use. When a</div>
<div id="tk_61" class="t s2_61">male customer enters a shop to buy a pair of shoes and a beautiful salesgirl approaches him, ﬁts a</div>
<div id="tl_61" class="t s2_61">pair of shoes on his feet with her own hands, ties the laces carefully and smilingly adds, ”Beautiful!</div>
<div id="tm_61" class="t s2_61">This pair looks so beautiful on your feet,” now, howsoever much that pair of shoes may be pinching</div>
<div id="tn_61" class="t s2_61">him, it is his compulsion to buy them. He will have to buy them. Now it is no more a question of</div>
<div id="to_61" class="t s2_61">shoes, now you are buying something else, the shoes are just an excuse.</div>
<div id="tp_61" class="t s2_61">We have all bought many such things which we never wanted. Our whole life is a similar collection</div>
<div id="tq_61" class="t s2_61">of things, and the ego is the total collection of all this. We have stolen the shine from the eyes of</div>
<div id="tr_61" class="t s2_61">others, put it all together and that has become our ﬂickering light. But it is always the others who are</div>
<div id="ts_61" class="t s2_61">the masters, any day they want to they can pull back the support.</div>
<div id="tt_61" class="t s2_61">Even the biggest of leaders is not bigger than his followers.</div>
<div id="tu_61" class="t s2_61">He cannot be, because his whole</div>
<div id="tv_61" class="t s2_61">leadership is in the hands of others. Today they have given it, tomorrow they can take it away.</div>
<div id="tw_61" class="t s2_61">Therefore, however great a leader may be he is a follower of his followers. He has to follow them.</div>
<div id="tx_61" class="t s2_61">He has to watch in which direction the followers are going, then he runs and stands in front of them.</div>
<div id="ty_61" class="t s2_61">He has to mark the direction of the wind, the direction of his followers, and his whole expertise is in</div>
<div id="tz_61" class="t s2_61">then running and standing in the front. And this is why, all the time, every day, the leader goes on</div>
<div id="t10_61" class="t s2_61">changing his statements. He has to change. That is what is called keeping the follower’s views in</div>
<div id="t11_61" class="t s2_61">mind. You have received your ego from them. Your prestige, position, everything you have received</div>
<div id="t12_61" class="t s2_61">from them – it is all borrowed. And whatever is a borrowed thing, it is not you. You were there before</div>
<div id="t13_61" class="t s2_61">all these things were received. When death snatches all this away from you, you will still be there.</div>
<div id="t14_61" class="t s2_61">You have created a false center, and if you have taken yourself to be this center, why then will you</div>
<div id="t15_61" class="t s2_61">then search for your real center? You have taken it for granted that this is the real center.</div>
<div id="t16_61" class="t s2_61">Finger Pointing to the Moon</div>
<div id="t17_61" class="t s2_61">61</div>
