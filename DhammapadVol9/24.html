<div id="t1_24" class="t s1_24">Mulla Nasruddin's wife went to the physician and said that "My husband talks in his </div>
<div id="t2_24" class="t s1_24">sleep. Something has to be done. I am very much disturbed about it." </div>
<div id="t3_24" class="t s1_24">The physician said, "I can understand. Take this medicine and within a week or two he </div>
<div id="t4_24" class="t s1_24">will stop talking in his sleep." </div>
<div id="t5_24" class="t s1_24">The wife said, "You misunderstand me. I don't want him to stop, I want him to talk </div>
<div id="t6_24" class="t s1_24">clearly so I can hear what he is saying." </div>
<div id="t7_24" class="t s1_24">People are talking in their sleep, people are talking while they are awake. People are </div>
<div id="t8_24" class="t s1_24">constantly talking; needed, not needed, they go on talking. Talking seems to be a kind </div>
<div id="t9_24" class="t s1_24">of escape from themselves. So Buddha says it is good for a few hours to be silent, but </div>
<div id="ta_24" class="t s1_24">there is no need to be silent forever. </div>
<div id="tb_24" class="t s1_24">It is said that Mahavira ate only once in a while. Ten days he would fast -- or twenty </div>
<div id="tc_24" class="t s1_24">days or thirty days -- and then one day he would take food. In those twelve years he </div>
<div id="td_24" class="t s1_24">took food only three hundred and sixty-five times; that means only one year. In twelve </div>
<div id="te_24" class="t s1_24">years, if that is the proportion, it comes to once every twelve days. </div>
<div id="tf_24" class="t s1_24">Buddha says that is unnecessary, that is torture, that is making an extreme effort for no </div>
<div id="tg_24" class="t s1_24">reason. It is perfectly good if you eat only as much as is needed; people are eating too </div>
<div id="th_24" class="t s1_24">much, people are stuffing themselves with food. That is again another way of keeping </div>
<div id="ti_24" class="t s1_24">yourself away from yourself, keeping yourself engaged. </div>
<div id="tj_24" class="t s1_24">People feel so empty -- like Prem Barkha -- everybody feels empty. And there is some </div>
<div id="tk_24" class="t s1_24">unconscious desire to fill this emptiness -- through food, through smoking, through </div>
<div id="tl_24" class="t s1_24">drink, through something; through talk, through the television, through the radio. Just </div>
<div id="tm_24" class="t s1_24">remain occupied so you feel full. </div>
<div id="tn_24" class="t s1_24">Just the other day I was reading that in America they have now invented a new kind of </div>
<div id="to_24" class="t s1_24">refrigerator. You open the door and the refrigerator immediately says, "Excuse me, be </div>
<div id="tp_24" class="t s1_24">kind to yourself. Please close the door." People are constantly moving towards the </div>
<div id="tq_24" class="t s1_24">fridge; that seems to be their only exercise. Even in the night when they have nothing to </div>
<div id="tr_24" class="t s1_24">do or they are not feeling sleepy they will go to the fridge. </div>
<div id="ts_24" class="t s1_24">There are people, and their number is big... out of ten, one person is capable of </div>
<div id="tt_24" class="t s1_24">sleepwalking. They walk in their sleep and the direction is always towards the fridge. </div>
<div id="tu_24" class="t s1_24">Even in sleep they know where the fridge is! They don't stumble anywhere, they go </div>
<div id="tv_24" class="t s1_24">directly like an arrow. Now this is one extreme, and not eating for eleven or twelve </div>
<div id="tw_24" class="t s1_24">days then eating only for one day, that is another extreme. </div>
<div id="tx_24" class="t s1_24">Buddha says "right food." Be in the middle. Eat as much as is necessary for your health, </div>
<div id="ty_24" class="t s1_24">for your well-being, don't eat too much. And that goes for everything in your life. </div>
<div id="tz_24" class="t s1_24">A lady went into a shoe store to buy a pair of shoes. The salesman brought her a pair </div>
<div id="t10_24" class="t s1_24">which she tried on. "Ah," she said, "I don't like these shoes. They are too wide. I don't </div>
<div id="t11_24" class="t s1_24">want them too wide, I don't want them too narrow. I just want them in between." </div>
<div id="t12_24" class="t s1_24">So the salesman gathered up the shoes and returned with another pair which were tried </div>
<div id="t13_24" class="t s1_24">on. This time she frowned and said, "These shoes won't do. The holes in the toes are too </div>
