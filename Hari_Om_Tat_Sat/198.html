<div id="t1_198" class="t s1_198">CHAPTER 22. HERE EVERYONE IS THE BEST</div>
<div id="t2_198" class="t s2_198">not conceive – what kind of crazy idea has he got, that he has to become a painter? He left the</div>
<div id="t3_198" class="t s2_198">family, but he had no other kind of education, qualiﬁcation. His brother used to send him every week</div>
<div id="t4_198" class="t s2_198">exactly seven days’ money for food, for clothes, for absolute necessities. And Van Gogh was fasting</div>
<div id="t5_198" class="t s2_198">for four days and saving the money to purchase paints and canvases and brushes. So one day he</div>
<div id="t6_198" class="t s2_198">would eat, one day he would fast.</div>
<div id="t7_198" class="t s2_198">Perhaps no man has fasted so spiritually. THIS I call a spiritual fast, because it is in the service of</div>
<div id="t8_198" class="t s2_198">creativity. It is not out of greed – you fast because you want heavenly pleasures after death. It will</div>
<div id="t9_198" class="t s2_198">be counted, how many fasts you did. It is sheer greed; it is not spirituality. You give to beggars just</div>
<div id="ta_198" class="t s2_198">as a way of opening an account in God’s bank. And these beggars go on saying that if you give one</div>
<div id="tb_198" class="t s2_198">rupee here, there you will get a thousand in return. It is not even business; it is sheer gambling. It is</div>
<div id="tc_198" class="t s2_198">not spirituality. Only a man like Van Gogh fasting can I say is spiritual.</div>
<div id="td_198" class="t s2_198">He would paint, and he was so far ahead of his contemporaries that nobody ever understood what he</div>
<div id="te_198" class="t s2_198">was painting. Not even painters could understand his paintings. He could not sell a single painting</div>
<div id="tf_198" class="t s2_198">his whole life. And now his paintings are sold for ten million dollars, a single painting; twelve million</div>
<div id="tg_198" class="t s2_198">dollars, a single painting. There are only two hundred left, and he had painted thousands. And he</div>
<div id="th_198" class="t s2_198">had given them just to friends, because what else to do? He had no place to collect them.</div>
<div id="ti_198" class="t s2_198">A man one day came to purchase a painting. Van Gogh was very happy. He started showing him</div>
<div id="tj_198" class="t s2_198">all the paintings that he thought were his best creations.</div>
<div id="tk_198" class="t s2_198">The man said, ”You don’t worry. You give me anything, just this is the price.”</div>
<div id="tl_198" class="t s2_198">This was so insulting. He immediately threw the money out on the street and pushed the man out</div>
<div id="tm_198" class="t s2_198">and told him, ”Tell my brother never to send any other man to purchase my paintings. You are not</div>
<div id="tn_198" class="t s2_198">the man... you don’t even have an eye for the beauty, for creativity. You don’t even want to see...</div>
<div id="to_198" class="t s2_198">Certainly I can say this money has been given by my brother to you, just to give me a little satisfaction</div>
<div id="tp_198" class="t s2_198">that at least one painting has been sold.”</div>
<div id="tq_198" class="t s2_198">It was a very strange life – fasting, continuously painting, he was becoming weaker and weaker.</div>
<div id="tr_198" class="t s2_198">Finally he wanted to paint the sun, so day after day he was just watching the sun – painting, but</div>
<div id="ts_198" class="t s2_198">rejecting the paintings; they were not coming up to his standard. He went crazy. He was forced to</div>
<div id="tt_198" class="t s2_198">enter a mental asylum. For one year he remained in that madhouse.</div>
<div id="tu_198" class="t s2_198">That was the only peaceful time, where the medical and the psychiatric doctors were sympathetic to</div>
<div id="tv_198" class="t s2_198">him, to his whole misery. He had done no harm. And they allowed him, from the institution’s money,</div>
<div id="tw_198" class="t s2_198">to have paints and everything that he wanted. For the ﬁrst time he had everything he needed to</div>
<div id="tx_198" class="t s2_198">paint without being hungry. His best paintings are those which he painted in a madhouse.</div>
<div id="ty_198" class="t s2_198">But still he was thought mad, because the paintings were not created for selling, the paintings were</div>
<div id="tz_198" class="t s2_198">not competitive, the paintings had no ambition; the paintings were not desires and greed to become</div>
<div id="t10_198" class="t s2_198">somebody special. The paintings were the children of his love. And he painted as an individual; his</div>
<div id="t11_198" class="t s2_198">society could not understand them, because he did not follow the society’s symbols.</div>
<div id="t12_198" class="t s2_198">For example, his trees all go higher than his stars. Now, anybody can point out, ”This is not factual.</div>
<div id="t13_198" class="t s2_198">Stars are far higher and your trees are going beyond the stars.” He said, ”What can I do? Whenever</div>
<div id="t14_198" class="t s2_198">Hari Om Tat Sat</div>
<div id="t15_198" class="t s2_198">198</div>
