<div id="t1_5" class="t s1_5">CHAPTER 1. ONE WHOSE ARROW IS SHOT</div>
<div id="t2_5" class="t s2_5">BEFORE WE ENTER into these Songs of Saraha, a few things about Saraha’s life: Saraha was</div>
<div id="t3_5" class="t s2_5">born in Vidarbha; Vidarbha is part of Maharashtra, very close to Poona. He was born when King</div>
<div id="t4_5" class="t s2_5">Mahapala was the ruler. He was the son of a very learned Brahmin who was in the court of King</div>
<div id="t5_5" class="t s2_5">Mahapala. The father was in the court so the young man was also in the court. He had four other</div>
<div id="t6_5" class="t s2_5">brothers; they were all great scholars, and he was the youngest and the most intelligent of them all.</div>
<div id="t7_5" class="t s2_5">His fame was spreading all over the country, by and by, and the king was almost enchanted by his</div>
<div id="t8_5" class="t s2_5">superb intelligence.</div>
<div id="t9_5" class="t s2_5">The four brothers were also very great scholars, but nothing to be compared with Saraha. As they</div>
<div id="ta_5" class="t s2_5">became mature, the four got married. The king was willing to give his own daughter to Saraha, but</div>
<div id="tb_5" class="t s2_5">Saraha wanted to renounce all – Saraha wanted to become a sannyasin. The king was hurt; he tried</div>
<div id="tc_5" class="t s2_5">to persuade Saraha – he was so beautiful and he was so intelligent and he was such a handsome</div>
<div id="td_5" class="t s2_5">young man. His fame was spreading all over the country, and because of him Mahapala’s court was</div>
<div id="te_5" class="t s2_5">becoming famous. The king was very much worried, and he didn’t want this young man to become</div>
<div id="tf_5" class="t s2_5">a sannyasin. He wanted to protect him, he wanted to give him all comfort possible – he was ready</div>
<div id="tg_5" class="t s2_5">to do anything for him. But Saraha persisted and the permission had to be given – he became a</div>
<div id="th_5" class="t s2_5">sannyasin, he became a disciple of Sri Kirti.</div>
<div id="ti_5" class="t s2_5">Sri Kirti is in the direct line of Buddha – Gautam Buddha, then his son Rahul Bhadra, and then</div>
<div id="tj_5" class="t s2_5">comes Sri Kirti. There are just two Masters between Saraha and Buddha; he is not very far away</div>
<div id="tk_5" class="t s2_5">from Buddha. The tree must have been still very, very green; the vibe must have been still very, very</div>
<div id="tl_5" class="t s2_5">alive. Buddha had just left. The climate must have been full of his fragrance.</div>
<div id="tm_5" class="t s2_5">The king was shocked, because Saraha was a Brahmin. If he wanted to become a sannyasin he</div>
<div id="tn_5" class="t s2_5">should have become a Hindu sannyasin, but he chose a Buddhist Master. Saraha’s family was also</div>
<div id="to_5" class="t s2_5">very much worried. In fact, they all became enemies... this was not right. And then things became</div>
<div id="tp_5" class="t s2_5">even worse – we will come to know about it.</div>
<div id="tq_5" class="t s2_5">Saraha’s original name was’Rahul’, the name given by his father. We will come to know how he</div>
<div id="tr_5" class="t s2_5">became Saraha – that is a beautiful story. When he went to Sri Kirti, the ﬁrst thing Sri Kirti told him</div>
<div id="ts_5" class="t s2_5">was: ”Forget all your Vedas and all your learning and all that nonsense.” It was difﬁcult for Saraha,</div>
<div id="tt_5" class="t s2_5">but he was ready to stake anything. Something in the presence of Sri Kirti had attracted him. Sri</div>
<div id="tu_5" class="t s2_5">Kirti was a great magnet. He dropped all his learning, he became unlearned again.</div>
<div id="tv_5" class="t s2_5">This is one of the greatest renunciations: it is easy to renounce wealth, it is easy to renounce a great</div>
<div id="tw_5" class="t s2_5">kingdom, but to renounce knowledge is the most difﬁcult thing in the world. In the ﬁrst place, how to</div>
<div id="tx_5" class="t s2_5">renounce it? It is there inside you. You can escape from your kingdom, you can go to the Himalayas,</div>
<div id="ty_5" class="t s2_5">you can distribute your wealth – how can you renounce your knowledge? And then it is too painful</div>
<div id="tz_5" class="t s2_5">to become ignorant again. It is the greatest austerity there is, to become ignorant again, to become</div>
<div id="t10_5" class="t s2_5">again innocent like a child... but he was ready.</div>
<div id="t11_5" class="t s2_5">Years passed and, by and by, he erased all that he had known.</div>
<div id="t12_5" class="t s2_5">He became a great meditator.</div>
<div id="t13_5" class="t s2_5">Just the same as he had started to become very famous as a great scholar, now his fame started</div>
<div id="t14_5" class="t s2_5">spreading as a great meditator. People started coming from far and away just to have a glimpse of</div>
<div id="t15_5" class="t s2_5">this young man who had become so innocent, like a fresh leaf, or like dew-drops on the grass in the</div>
<div id="t16_5" class="t s2_5">morning.</div>
<div id="t17_5" class="t s2_5">The Tantra Vision, Vol 1</div>
<div id="t18_5" class="t s2_5">5</div>
