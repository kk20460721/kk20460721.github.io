<div id="t1_201" class="t s1_201">CHAPTER 7. GOD IS THE BUSINESS OF THE PRIEST</div>
<div id="t2_201" class="t s2_201">And Barabbas could not believe it himself. He was also thinking that this young fellow, who was only</div>
<div id="t3_201" class="t s2_201">thirty-three... and he had heard him, he was always talking around the place. He was moving around</div>
<div id="t4_201" class="t s2_201">Jerusalem on his donkey, and whenever he could get an audience he would start talking. He was</div>
<div id="t5_201" class="t s2_201">a street sermonizer – so once in a while Barabbas had heard him talk, and he liked him, the fellow</div>
<div id="t6_201" class="t s2_201">was nice and he was saying beautiful things. He hoped, of course, that he would be released, but</div>
<div id="t7_201" class="t s2_201">when he was told by the Jews, he could not believe it. He was shocked. When he was taken away</div>
<div id="t8_201" class="t s2_201">from the cross he still could not believe that it was real. He looked back again and again, walking</div>
<div id="t9_201" class="t s2_201">towards the pub. And within seven days he had killed another man.</div>
<div id="ta_201" class="t s2_201">So Pontius Pilate was very willing, and the cave in which Jesus was put was guarded by a Roman</div>
<div id="tb_201" class="t s2_201">guard. The Jews could not do it because it was their Sabbath day, on which day they cannot do</div>
<div id="tc_201" class="t s2_201">anything.</div>
<div id="td_201" class="t s2_201">The cruciﬁxion happened on Friday, it was an arrangement.</div>
<div id="te_201" class="t s2_201">The whole credit goes to</div>
<div id="tf_201" class="t s2_201">Pontius Pilate, not to God and resurrection. It was arranged that on Friday – because Saturday is</div>
<div id="tg_201" class="t s2_201">the Sabbath day of the Jews; they don’t do anything, everything stops – on the Friday the cruciﬁxion</div>
<div id="th_201" class="t s2_201">was delayed as much as possible, because until Pontius Pilate comes the cruciﬁxion cannot happen.</div>
<div id="ti_201" class="t s2_201">He went as late as possible, so the cruciﬁxion happened just after twelve o’clock in the middle of the</div>
<div id="tj_201" class="t s2_201">day. And the Jewish cross is such that if a healthy man is on it, it will take forty-eight hours for him</div>
<div id="tk_201" class="t s2_201">to die – because it is a very slow process, a slow torture.</div>
<div id="tl_201" class="t s2_201">Blood starts moving from the hands and the legs. Only four nails are used: two in the hands, two</div>
<div id="tm_201" class="t s2_201">in the legs. So slowly the blood oozes out. And blood has a tendency to get dry. It has a chemical</div>
<div id="tn_201" class="t s2_201">element that dries it; if you don’t have that chemical then your life is always in danger.</div>
<div id="to_201" class="t s2_201">There is a disease called hemophilia where your blood goes on ﬂowing, it does not dry. That was an</div>
<div id="tp_201" class="t s2_201">important factor in the situation before the Russian revolution. The Czar’s only son had hemophilia</div>
<div id="tq_201" class="t s2_201">– the only son, who was going to succeed.</div>
<div id="tr_201" class="t s2_201">And this was a problem, because it gave power to</div>
<div id="ts_201" class="t s2_201">Rasputin, a village priest, absolutely uneducated but with some knowledge of hypnotizing people.</div>
<div id="tt_201" class="t s2_201">He was called again and again; whenever the son started bleeding – any small scratch and the</div>
<div id="tu_201" class="t s2_201">blood cannot stop by itself; it won’t dry – Rasputin had to be called immediately. He became so</div>
<div id="tv_201" class="t s2_201">powerful that the czar, the emperor of Russia, was almost dependent on him.</div>
<div id="tw_201" class="t s2_201">The wife of the czar was just a worshipper of Rasputin, and he was a villager, who knew nothing</div>
<div id="tx_201" class="t s2_201">except a small strategy of hypnotizing people. So he used to hypnotize the boy, and in hypnosis he</div>
<div id="ty_201" class="t s2_201">used to tell him, ”Your blood will stop.” In hypnosis everything is possible.</div>
<div id="tz_201" class="t s2_201">Hypnosis is a very powerful method, and he was the only person who could make the blood stop.</div>
<div id="t10_201" class="t s2_201">No doctors were able to do anything; there is no cure in any medical science.</div>
<div id="t11_201" class="t s2_201">So it takes forty-eight hours for a person to die on the Jewish cross because the blood goes on again</div>
<div id="t12_201" class="t s2_201">and again drying; people have to remove the dry blood so that fresh blood starts coming again. It</div>
<div id="t13_201" class="t s2_201">takes forty-eight hours, and Jesus was only six hours on the cross – from twelve to six. As the sun</div>
<div id="t14_201" class="t s2_201">was setting he had to be taken off the cross, because on Saturday nothing can continue. Everything</div>
<div id="t15_201" class="t s2_201">stops; even cruciﬁxion has to stop. In six hours a young man of thirty-three cannot die. This is a</div>
<div id="t16_201" class="t s2_201">scientiﬁc fact.</div>
<div id="t17_201" class="t s2_201">And no Jew would be ready to guard, because that would be against his religion; he would be doing</div>
<div id="t18_201" class="t s2_201">some duty, some work. So a Roman was on guard – that was perfect. The stone was removed and</div>
<div id="t19_201" class="t s2_201">God is Dead, Now Zen is the Only Living Truth 201</div>
<div id="t1a_201" class="t s3_201">Osho</div>
