<div id="t1_62" class="t s1_62">Prem Vidya, there is nothing more to it. It is a simple phenomenon: consciousness is </div>
<div id="t2_62" class="t s1_62">intrinsically blissful. Bliss is not a result; it is inbuilt in consciousness. It does not come </div>
<div id="t3_62" class="t s1_62">from the outside; it flowers inside consciousness. It is the fragrance of the flowering </div>
<div id="t4_62" class="t s1_62">consciousness. When the rose of consciousness opens, the fragrance is bliss. </div>
<div id="t5_62" class="t s1_62">And when your being closes in unconsciousness, that dead and stale air, that stink, that </div>
<div id="t6_62" class="t s1_62">darkness, is misery. That too is intrinsic, because now the fresh air cannot flow through </div>
<div id="t7_62" class="t s1_62">you; your doors, your windows, are all closed. Now the sunrays cannot reach inside </div>
<div id="t8_62" class="t s1_62">you. You are not available to rain, to wind, to sun. You have become isolated from </div>
<div id="t9_62" class="t s1_62">existence. You have become a monad, windowless. You have become encapsulated, </div>
<div id="ta_62" class="t s1_62">completely closed into your own self, into your own ego. You have disconnected </div>
<div id="tb_62" class="t s1_62">yourself from this immensely beautiful, blissful existence; hence, misery. It is not really </div>
<div id="tc_62" class="t s1_62">a result; it is unconsciousness itself, another name for it. </div>
<div id="td_62" class="t s1_62">And people ARE living unconsciously, but they don't see it. They go on saying they are </div>
<div id="te_62" class="t s1_62">living in misery and they want not to live in misery, but they always throw the </div>
<div id="tf_62" class="t s1_62">responsibility on something else, somebody else. Either it is fate or it is the society, the </div>
<div id="tg_62" class="t s1_62">economic structure, the state, the church, the wife, the husband, the mother -- but </div>
<div id="th_62" class="t s1_62">always somebody else. </div>
<div id="ti_62" class="t s1_62">Religion starts in your life when you take the responsibility on yourself. To take the </div>
<div id="tj_62" class="t s1_62">responsibility for your misery is the beginning of change, because even to accept that "I </div>
<div id="tk_62" class="t s1_62">am responsible for whatsoever I am," is the beginning of consciousness. You are coming </div>
<div id="tl_62" class="t s1_62">out of a state of drunkenness in which you have lived for centuries. </div>
<div id="tm_62" class="t s1_62">Poteen is an Irish illegal brew that can burn holes in steel plate. After a pint of it </div>
<div id="tn_62" class="t s1_62">Flaherty saw so many animals in his room that he put a sign on his house, FLAHERTY'S </div>
<div id="to_62" class="t s1_62">ZOO. </div>
<div id="tp_62" class="t s1_62">The local sergeant went to reason with him and was no sooner in than he was offered a </div>
<div id="tq_62" class="t s1_62">glass of the Mountain Dew. When the policeman staggered out thirty minutes later he </div>
<div id="tr_62" class="t s1_62">raised his hand for silence, although there was nobody. "Ish alright, men. The worst is </div>
<div id="ts_62" class="t s1_62">over. He sold me half the elephants." </div>
<div id="tt_62" class="t s1_62">You are living in a state of drunkenness. You don't need alcohol -- alcohol is circulating </div>
<div id="tu_62" class="t s1_62">in your blood already. You don't need marijuana, LSD, mescaline, no -- you are already </div>
<div id="tv_62" class="t s1_62">stuffed with it. You are born unconscious! But because everybody else is like you, you </div>
<div id="tw_62" class="t s1_62">never become aware of it. </div>
<div id="tx_62" class="t s1_62">Only when awakening starts happening in you, then you become aware, comparatively, </div>
<div id="ty_62" class="t s1_62">that up to now you have lived in a kind of sleep, that you have been a sleepwalker, a </div>
<div id="tz_62" class="t s1_62">somnambulist, that whatsoever you have done up to now has been done unconsciously. </div>
<div id="t10_62" class="t s1_62">And because you were doing things unconsciously and moving blindly in life, like </div>
<div id="t11_62" class="t s1_62">driftwood, with no sense of direction, with no idea where you are going, with no idea </div>
<div id="t12_62" class="t s1_62">who you are, how can you hope to be blissful? You can only be miserable, more or less. </div>
<div id="t13_62" class="t s1_62">When you are a little less miserable you call it happiness. It is not really happiness, but </div>
<div id="t14_62" class="t s1_62">a little less misery than the normal. When it is a little too much you enter into anguish. </div>
