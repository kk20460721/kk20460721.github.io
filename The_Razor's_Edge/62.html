<div id="t1_62" class="t s1_62">CHAPTER 6. LAUGHTER IS THE ESSENTIAL RELIGION</div>
<div id="t2_62" class="t s2_62">but by the time he reached the commune, other guards, more efﬁcient, had taken his place. He was</div>
<div id="t3_62" class="t s2_62">not made the chief guard. Then all his love disappeared, all gratitude disappeared.</div>
<div id="t4_62" class="t s2_62">He has written a book against me now, full of lies, with no foundation in truth. But he has to justify</div>
<div id="t5_62" class="t s2_62">why he has left. Still he is blind, still he cannot see that it was power that was keeping him here and</div>
<div id="t6_62" class="t s2_62">it is power that is now taking revenge.</div>
<div id="t7_62" class="t s2_62">I have no complaint against anybody, but I understand your whole mind. You don’t understand your</div>
<div id="t8_62" class="t s2_62">whole mind. You only understand the part that is on the surface in this moment.</div>
<div id="t9_62" class="t s2_62">The whole commune was created by Sheela. And she did hard and great work – there is nothing</div>
<div id="ta_62" class="t s2_62">except appreciation. But deep down she was very much worried, because she had taken the place</div>
<div id="tb_62" class="t s2_62">of Laxmi – and the fear was natural that somebody else could take her place.</div>
<div id="tc_62" class="t s2_62">She never wanted me to see anybody else except her. When I was in silence for three and half</div>
<div id="td_62" class="t s2_62">years, only she was seeing me, reporting how things were going on.</div>
<div id="te_62" class="t s2_62">And everything was going</div>
<div id="tf_62" class="t s2_62">perfectly well. She had a great managing capacity and absolute devotion.</div>
<div id="tg_62" class="t s2_62">When I used to go for ”drive-by” she used to carry a gun by the side of my car; she learned to shoot,</div>
<div id="th_62" class="t s2_62">she got thirty people trained. And she was working from morning till late in the night. Nobody would</div>
<div id="ti_62" class="t s2_62">have thought that she could say anything against me.</div>
<div id="tj_62" class="t s2_62">But as I started speaking, after three and a half years, people started sending questions relating to</div>
<div id="tk_62" class="t s2_62">the work, relating to her dictatorial methods – that anybody who does not listen to her is immediately</div>
<div id="tl_62" class="t s2_62">thrown out of the commune. And because only she was seeing me, I knew only as much as she</div>
<div id="tm_62" class="t s2_62">related to me – and that was the part she chose.</div>
<div id="tn_62" class="t s2_62">So I said to her, ”This is not right. I will have to see a few more people so that I can be aware of what</div>
<div id="to_62" class="t s2_62">exactly is going on in the commune. And if I ﬁnd that you are doing something wrong, I can put you</div>
<div id="tp_62" class="t s2_62">right.” I started seeing two, three people once in a while – just to get an idea of whether Sheela is</div>
<div id="tq_62" class="t s2_62">representing things to me exactly, and I found she was not being truthful. This was the point when</div>
<div id="tr_62" class="t s2_62">she became afraid, afraid of those people who were seeing me. And the commune had become</div>
<div id="ts_62" class="t s2_62">almost an empire in itself.</div>
<div id="tt_62" class="t s2_62">She would have died for me, but the day I declared that there will be no successor to me, that instead</div>
<div id="tu_62" class="t s2_62">of a successor there will be a committee of enlightened people who will choose who is going to be</div>
<div id="tv_62" class="t s2_62">in charge of the commune</div>
<div id="tw_62" class="t s2_62">....</div>
<div id="tx_62" class="t s2_62">deep down there must have been the hope that she was going to</div>
<div id="ty_62" class="t s2_62">succeed me.</div>
<div id="tz_62" class="t s2_62">She started things which are inconceivable. She bugged my room, to be aware of what other people</div>
<div id="t10_62" class="t s2_62">were telling me, what my answers to them were. And it was the same person who was moving with</div>
<div id="t11_62" class="t s2_62">the gun to save my life. But the desire for power, which was unconscious up to now, and perhaps</div>
<div id="t12_62" class="t s2_62">to her it remained unconscious</div>
<div id="t13_62" class="t s2_62">....</div>
<div id="t14_62" class="t s2_62">But bugging your own master’s room</div>
<div id="t15_62" class="t s2_62">....</div>
<div id="t16_62" class="t s2_62">On the one hand trusting</div>
<div id="t17_62" class="t s2_62">me totally – but bugging my room is not trust. She was afraid that I might be preparing somebody –</div>
<div id="t18_62" class="t s2_62">in case someone could take better care of the commune.</div>
<div id="t19_62" class="t s2_62">She tried to poison Vivek, because she was the one who was taking care of my body...</div>
<div id="t1a_62" class="t s2_62">just to</div>
<div id="t1b_62" class="t s2_62">remove her, so that she could put in somebody who would only report what Sheela wanted – her</div>
<div id="t1c_62" class="t s2_62">The Razor’s Edge</div>
<div id="t1d_62" class="t s2_62">62</div>
<div id="t1e_62" class="t s3_62">Osho</div>
