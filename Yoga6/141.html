<div id="t2_141" class="t s1_141">pratyahar, returning home. Now there is no longer any interest in the outside </div>
<div id="t3_141" class="t s1_141">world, so you don't move in a thousand and one directions. Now you would like </div>
<div id="t4_141" class="t s1_141">to know yourself; the desire to know oneself replaces all other desires. Only one </div>
<div id="t5_141" class="t s1_141">desire is left now: to know oneself. </div>
<div id="t6_141" class="t s1_141">Tatah parama vashyate indriyanam. </div>

<div id="t8_141" class="t s1_141">When you are returning home, inwards, suddenly you become the master. This </div>
<div id="t9_141" class="t s1_141">is the beauty of the process. If you are moving outwards you remain a slave -- </div>
<div id="ta_141" class="t s1_141">and a slave to millions of things. Your slavery is infinite, because infinite are the </div>
<div id="tb_141" class="t s1_141">objects of your desire. </div>
<div id="tc_141" class="t s1_141">It happened: I was a teacher in a university. Just next to me a professor used to </div>
<div id="td_141" class="t s1_141">live. I have never come across such a miserly man; he was really extraordinary. </div>
<div id="te_141" class="t s1_141">He had enough money; his father had left much. He and his wife lived alone. </div>
<div id="tf_141" class="t s1_141">Enough money, a big house, everything -- but he used such a bicycle that it was </div>
<div id="tg_141" class="t s1_141">known all over the town. </div>
<div id="th_141" class="t s1_141">That bicycle was something of a miracle. Nobody else could use it: it was in such </div>
<div id="ti_141" class="t s1_141">a ruin it was impossible to use it. It was known all over the town that he never </div>
<div id="tj_141" class="t s1_141">locked the bicycle, because there was no need -- nobody could steal it. People </div>
<div id="tk_141" class="t s1_141">had tried, and returned it. He would go to the theater; he would leave the bicycle </div>
<div id="tl_141" class="t s1_141">outside. He would not put it on the stand, because one anna would have to be </div>
<div id="tm_141" class="t s1_141">paid. He would leave it anywhere, and after three hours when he would come, </div>
<div id="tn_141" class="t s1_141">he would always find it there. It had no mudguards, no horn, no chain cover, </div>
<div id="to_141" class="t s1_141">and it made such a noise that you could hear from one mile that that professor </div>
<div id="tp_141" class="t s1_141">was coming. </div>
<div id="tq_141" class="t s1_141">By and by, he became friendly with me. I suggested to him, "This is too much, </div>
<div id="tr_141" class="t s1_141">and everybody laughs about your cycle. Why don't you get rid of it?" </div>
<div id="ts_141" class="t s1_141">He said, "What to do? I have been trying to sell it, but nobody is ready to </div>
<div id="tt_141" class="t s1_141">purchase it." </div>
<div id="tu_141" class="t s1_141">"Nobody is ready to purchase it because it is not worth anything. You simply go </div>
<div id="tv_141" class="t s1_141">and throw it in the river -- and thank God if somebody doesn't bring it back!" </div>
<div id="tw_141" class="t s1_141">He said, "I will think about it." But he couldn't. </div>
<div id="tx_141" class="t s1_141">So, his next birthday was coming and I purchased a new cycle, the best that was </div>
<div id="ty_141" class="t s1_141">available, and presented it to him. He was very happy. The next day I was </div>
<div id="tz_141" class="t s1_141">waiting to see him on the new bicycle but he was again on the old. So I asked, </div>
<div id="t10_141" class="t s1_141">"What is the matter?" </div>
<div id="t11_141" class="t s1_141">He said, "The cycle you have given to me is so beautiful, I cannot use it." </div>
<div id="t12_141" class="t s1_141">It became a worship object. He would clean it every day; I would see that he was </div>
<div id="t13_141" class="t s1_141">cleaning it. He would clean it and polish it and do and</div>
<div id="t14_141" class="t s1_141">....</div>
<div id="t15_141" class="t s1_141">Always it was there in </div>
<div id="t16_141" class="t s1_141">his house as a showpiece, and he was running on his bicycle -- four, five miles </div>
