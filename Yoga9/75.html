<div id="t1_75" class="t s1_75">When these powers start happening, you start receiving invitations from higher entities, </div>
<div id="t2_75" class="t s1_75">supraphysical entities. You must have heard or you must have read about the </div>
<div id="t3_75" class="t s1_75">Theosophists. Their whole work had to do with these supraphysical entities. They used to </div>
<div id="t4_75" class="t s1_75">call them "the Masters." There are superphysical entities who go on communicating with </div>
<div id="t5_75" class="t s1_75">human beings, and whenever you rise high, you become available to them; you become </div>
<div id="t6_75" class="t s1_75">more in tune with them. You receive many invitations, many messages. </div>
<div id="t7_75" class="t s1_75">That's what Mohammedans call "paigam," the message; and they call Mohammed </div>
<div id="t8_75" class="t s1_75">"paigambar," one who received the message. They don't call him an avatar, they don't call </div>
<div id="t9_75" class="t s1_75">him "God reincarnate." They don't call him a Buddha, one who has become enlightened. </div>
<div id="ta_75" class="t s1_75">They don't call him a jina, one who has conquered. They don't call him a messiah, a </div>
<div id="tb_75" class="t s1_75">Christ, no. They have a very, very perfect, scientific terminology for it: they call him "the </div>
<div id="tc_75" class="t s1_75">messenger" -- paigambar. It means simply that he has risen high and now he is </div>
<div id="td_75" class="t s1_75">functioning no more; some other entities, higher entities, have taken possession of him. </div>
<div id="te_75" class="t s1_75">He has become a medium. </div>
<div id="tf_75" class="t s1_75">And it is so. Mohammed was illiterate; it is almost impossible to think or imagine that he </div>
<div id="tg_75" class="t s1_75">could have given birth to the beautiful poetry of the Koran. It is incomparably beautiful; </div>
<div id="th_75" class="t s1_75">it is one of the greatest songs; and if you can hear somebody singing it, you will be </div>
<div id="ti_75" class="t s1_75">affected by it immediately. Even if you don't understand its meaning, it has tremendous </div>
<div id="tj_75" class="t s1_75">power. The very sound has tremendous power to stir you. </div>
<div id="tk_75" class="t s1_75">Mohammed was illiterate, not knowing how to read, how to write, not knowing anything </div>
<div id="tl_75" class="t s1_75">about literature and the world of letters. Suddenly, meditating on a mountain, he became </div>
<div id="tm_75" class="t s1_75">available, and he heard, "Read!" this word "read," but said, "How can I read?" The word </div>
<div id="tn_75" class="t s1_75">"koran" means "read." "How can I read? I don't know," Mohammed said, and he became </div>
<div id="to_75" class="t s1_75">very much bewildered, who has said this. He could not see anybody anywhere. Again this </div>
<div id="tp_75" class="t s1_75">voice came, "Read!" It was coming from his own heart; he had become a channel. And, </div>
<div id="tq_75" class="t s1_75">of course, he was thinking about his past, and the voice was saying something about his </div>
<div id="tr_75" class="t s1_75">future. The voice was saying, "I can read, don't be worried.Just read -- I will be reading </div>
<div id="ts_75" class="t s1_75">through you. You recite -- I will be reciting through you. You say -- I will be saying </div>
<div id="tt_75" class="t s1_75">through you. Just put yourself out of the way." </div>
<div id="tu_75" class="t s1_75">It was so strange, so unexpected, that he had a high fever; he became puzzled so much. </div>
<div id="tv_75" class="t s1_75">He came home, fell ill. The wife asked, "What has happened? Just in the morning you </div>
<div id="tw_75" class="t s1_75">were perfectly well, and such a high fever?" He said, "I will tell you one thing. Either I </div>
<div id="tx_75" class="t s1_75">have gone mad or something has happened from the beyond. I cannot believe that I am </div>
<div id="ty_75" class="t s1_75">capable of anything, but I have heard a voice which says, 'Read! Recite!' and I don't know </div>
<div id="tz_75" class="t s1_75">what to recite -- and not only that, I started reciting! I heard myself saying things I have </div>
<div id="t10_75" class="t s1_75">never thought about, and they were coming in perfect poetry, with meter, rhythm, and </div>
<div id="t11_75" class="t s1_75">everything. I cannot believe it. Either I have gone mad or I have been taken possession of </div>
<div id="t12_75" class="t s1_75">by somebody -- but I am no longer the same husband. Run and fetch a physician; I will </div>
<div id="t13_75" class="t s1_75">need treatment. I am going continuously mad, and I am still hearing this voice,'Recite!' -- </div>
<div id="t14_75" class="t s1_75">and beautiful poetries are descending in me and filling my heart." </div>
<div id="t15_75" class="t s1_75">The wife was his first disciple. She touched his feet. She could see the radiance all around </div>
<div id="t16_75" class="t s1_75">him. It was not fever; it was the first explosion of his aura. He was feeling feverish </div>
<div id="t17_75" class="t s1_75">because it was so hot, so new, and he was disturbed because he was not ready, he was </div>
<div id="t18_75" class="t s1_75">never expecting, he had not planned for it. </div>
