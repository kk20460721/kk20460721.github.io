<div id="t2_101" class="t s1_101">There was no problem, ever. Why with swords? Try to understand. </div>
<div id="t3_101" class="t s1_101">Whenever you carry a sword, it is not against anybody else; it is only because </div>
<div id="t4_101" class="t s1_101">you are afraid. It is because of your fear. They were afraid. For what they were </div>
<div id="t5_101" class="t s1_101">going to commit, they were already guilty about it. These swords were not </div>
<div id="t6_101" class="t s1_101">against Jesus because they were not needed against him. Those swords were </div>

<div id="t8_101" class="t s1_101">to face Jesus was going to be difficult. Just to look into his eyes would be very </div>
<div id="t9_101" class="t s1_101">difficult. And to catch hold of him, to make him a prisoner was going to be </div>
<div id="ta_101" class="t s1_101">almost impossible. </div>
<div id="tb_101" class="t s1_101">They came with swords to have courage, to not be afraid. They came with </div>
<div id="tc_101" class="t s1_101">swords so there would be no need to look into this man's eyes. Bare-handed, he </div>
<div id="td_101" class="t s1_101">could have been caught anywhere. He was absolutely unprotected, insecure. </div>
<div id="te_101" class="t s1_101">And these people knew him well. There was no need, in fact, for Judas even to </div>
<div id="tf_101" class="t s1_101">indicate who he was. Everybody knew about him. </div>
<div id="tg_101" class="t s1_101">But the priests were also afraid, the politicians were also afraid. They also </div>
<div id="th_101" class="t s1_101">wanted to throw the responsibility on somebody else who could be, could </div>

<div id="tj_101" class="t s1_101">became the symbol of betrayal. It is as if Judas became the real culprit. </div>

<div id="tt_101" class="t s1_101">they are fulfilling simple prophecies. </div>

<div id="tx_101" class="t s1_101">else can you do? </div>

<div id="tz_101" class="t s1_101">it has been written already and it is only unfolding. </div>
<div id="t10_101" class="t s1_101">Jesus said to those people,'But all this was done that the scriptures of the </div>
