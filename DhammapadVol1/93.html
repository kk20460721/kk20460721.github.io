<div id="t1_93" class="t s1_93">Zusiya opened his eyes, and these were his last words. He said, "Stop talking nonsense! </div>
<div id="t2_93" class="t s1_93">God is not going to ask me, 'Zusiya, why were you not a Moses?' He will ask me, </div>
<div id="t3_93" class="t s1_93">'Zusiya, why were you not a Zusiya?'" </div>
<div id="t4_93" class="t s1_93">You have to be just yourself and nobody else. And in fact that's what buddhahood </div>
<div id="t5_93" class="t s1_93">means: to be yourself. That is what christ-consciousness means: just to be yourself. </div>
<div id="t6_93" class="t s1_93">Buddha was not an imitation of somebody else. Don't you think there were many many </div>
<div id="t7_93" class="t s1_93">great men who had preceded him? He must have been told, "Be a Krishna! Be a </div>
<div id="t8_93" class="t s1_93">Parshvanath! Be an Adinatha!" He must have heard beautiful stories, mythologies. He </div>
<div id="t9_93" class="t s1_93">must have read the PURANAS, ancient stories about the great men, Rama, Krishna, </div>
<div id="ta_93" class="t s1_93">Parasuram. He must have heard all that, he must have received the heritage. But he </div>
<div id="tb_93" class="t s1_93">never tried to be somebody. He wanted to be himself, he wanted to know who he is. He </div>
<div id="tc_93" class="t s1_93">never became an imitator; that's why one day he became awakened. </div>
<div id="td_93" class="t s1_93">Jesus never tried to be Abraham, Moses, Ezekiel. Jesus simply tried to be himself. That </div>
<div id="te_93" class="t s1_93">was his crime, that's why he was crucified. The same people who crucified Jesus would </div>
<div id="tf_93" class="t s1_93">have worshipped him if he had simply been an imitator, a carbon copy of Moses. If he </div>
<div id="tg_93" class="t s1_93">had been just a gramophone record repeating the Ten Commandments, the Jews would </div>
<div id="th_93" class="t s1_93">have worshipped him. But they had to crucify the man -- he was just himself. </div>
<div id="ti_93" class="t s1_93">The rotten society, the crowd, the mob mind, cannot tolerate individuals. It is </div>
<div id="tj_93" class="t s1_93">impossible for them to tolerate a Socrates. Do you know what the charge was against </div>
<div id="tk_93" class="t s1_93">Socrates? Exactly the same thing is said about me! This was the crime of Socrates, that </div>
<div id="tl_93" class="t s1_93">he used to corrupt the minds of the youth. That's exactly what my enemies say: that I </div>
<div id="tm_93" class="t s1_93">am corrupting people's minds, particularly the minds of the youth. </div>
<div id="tn_93" class="t s1_93">Socrates was corrupting the minds of the youth? He was trying to awaken their </div>
<div id="to_93" class="t s1_93">intelligence, but the society became afraid. If so many people become so authentic, true, </div>
<div id="tp_93" class="t s1_93">then the vested interests are in danger. Then you cannot drive people like cattle. And </div>
<div id="tq_93" class="t s1_93">that's what priests enjoy, and the politicians too. </div>
<div id="tr_93" class="t s1_93">There is a conspiracy between the priest and the politician to exploit people, to </div>
<div id="ts_93" class="t s1_93">dominate people, to oppress people. And the fundamental is: never allow them to </div>
<div id="tt_93" class="t s1_93">become intelligent. Give them substitutes. What is the substitute for intelligence? -- </div>
<div id="tu_93" class="t s1_93">intellectuality. Give them education; send them to the school, to the college, to the </div>
<div id="tv_93" class="t s1_93">university, so they become intellectuals. </div>
<div id="tw_93" class="t s1_93">Have you ever heard of universities creating intelligence? They create intellectuals, they </div>
<div id="tx_93" class="t s1_93">create scholars, they create people who know the scriptures -- to the very word they can </div>
<div id="ty_93" class="t s1_93">repeat the scriptures -- but they don't create intelligent people. They serve society; the </div>
<div id="tz_93" class="t s1_93">educational system is invented by this rotten society to serve its own purposes. It is not </div>

<div id="t12_93" class="t s1_93">conscious. And if you are conscious the garbage will be dropped of its own accord. One </div>
<div id="t13_93" class="t s1_93">day suddenly you will find it disappearing...suddenly disappearing. As consciousness </div>
<div id="t14_93" class="t s1_93">deepens, all garbage disappears -- just as you bring light in and darkness disperses. </div>
<div id="t15_93" class="t s1_93">Buddha says: Become more aware and the light will start pouring in...aes dhammo </div>
