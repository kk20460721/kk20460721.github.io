<div id="tc_61" class="t s1_61">accounts be closed. This time behave in a good way!" And of course, to be a </div>
<div id="td_61" class="t s1_61">revolutionary is not something good! Be obedient -- that is good -- don't be disobedient. </div>
<div id="te_61" class="t s1_61">Disobedience is evil, it is sin. The Christians call it the original sin. </div>
<div id="tf_61" class="t s1_61">What was the sin of Adam and Eve? -- just because they had disobeyed God. There </div>
