<div id="t1_173" class="t s1_173">Man is very frail, very vulnerable. Ta Hui is not an exception. When he called Gautam</div>
<div id="t2_173" class="t s1_173">Buddha "the barbarian" he was at the farthest point from realization; -- he was lost in a jungle.</div>
<div id="t3_173" class="t s1_173">To call Buddha a barbarian means there is no hope for man, ever. Buddha is a great hope in</div>
<div id="t4_173" class="t s1_173">the sense that he has shown what is hidden in man's being, and he has brought it more clearly</div>
<div id="t5_173" class="t s1_173">than anybody else in the world.</div>
<div id="t6_173" class="t s1_173">Bertrand Russell remembers ... He lived a long life, almost one century and saw many</div>
<div id="t7_173" class="t s1_173">things happening -- a long life of tremendous changes, revolutions, wars. He was brought up</div>
<div id="t8_173" class="t s1_173">with a very fanatic Christian conditioning, but he was a man of tremendous intelligence and</div>
<div id="t9_173" class="t s1_173">courage. He dropped all that conditioning because he looked into THE BIBLE with an open</div>
<div id="ta_173" class="t s1_173">mind -- not as a Christian -- and he found so many stupid statements that he had to write a</div>
<div id="tb_173" class="t s1_173">book: WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN.</div>
<div id="tc_173" class="t s1_173">But he remarks in his autobiography: "Although I have dropped almost all my</div>
<div id="td_173" class="t s1_173">conditioning, it is an impossible task -- even through the conditioning has been dropped, some</div>
<div id="te_173" class="t s1_173">traces somewhere have still remained. I became aware of those traces because when I read</div>
<div id="tf_173" class="t s1_173">Gautam Buddha I was immensely satisfied that this is the man, the greatest man who has</div>
<div id="tg_173" class="t s1_173">walked on the earth. But then suddenly something in me felt uneasy -- how can somebody be a</div>
<div id="th_173" class="t s1_173">greater man than Jesus Christ. And I was amazed; I had been thinking that I am no longer a</div>
<div id="ti_173" class="t s1_173">Christian!"</div>
<div id="tj_173" class="t s1_173">He has criticized Jesus on many points, and with such clear logic that no theologian of</div>
<div id="tk_173" class="t s1_173">Christianity has been able to answer him -- and I suspect even Jesus may not have been able to</div>
<div id="tl_173" class="t s1_173">answer him! His questions are very clear.</div>
<div id="tm_173" class="t s1_173">For example he says, "Jesus goes on talking about compassion, love: 'Love your enemies,</div>
<div id="tn_173" class="t s1_173">love your neighbors'" -- which is an even more difficult thing because enemies live far away.</div>
<div id="to_173" class="t s1_173">You don't have to bother about them the whole time, but the neighbors are very close enemies</div>
<div id="tp_173" class="t s1_173">continuously harassing you in some way or other. Christians call Jesus a prince of peace, but</div>
<div id="tq_173" class="t s1_173">Bertrand Russell finds in THE BIBLE incidents which prove that Jesus was not a man of</div>
<div id="tr_173" class="t s1_173">peace. And he is caught up in such stupid incidents that there is no way to clean it up or to</div>
<div id="ts_173" class="t s1_173">explain it away.</div>
<div id="tt_173" class="t s1_173">One day they had been hungry -- he and his followers -- because the people of the town</div>
<div id="tu_173" class="t s1_173">had refused to give them any food. Jesus was so angry that when he came close to a fig tree ...</div>
<div id="tv_173" class="t s1_173">it was not the season for figs and the tree was without any fruits, but he was so blind in anger</div>
<div id="tw_173" class="t s1_173">that he cursed the tree, "You will always remain an ugly tree because the only begotten son of</div>
<div id="tx_173" class="t s1_173">God has come to you, and you are not ready with fruits -- with no welcome!"</div>
<div id="ty_173" class="t s1_173">Bertrand Russell says, "Intellectually I understand perfectly that Gautam Buddha is</div>
<div id="tz_173" class="t s1_173">perhaps the highest expression; Jesus is no comparison to him. But somewhere deep down I</div>
<div id="t10_173" class="t s1_173">could not manage ... the most I could do was to say that both were equal. I could not put Jesus</div>
<div id="t11_173" class="t s1_173">Christ lower than Gautam Buddha knowing perfectly well that Gautam Buddha is far higher.</div>
<div id="t12_173" class="t s1_173">But that is only intellectual understanding. The conditioning goes into the unconscious, and</div>
<div id="t13_173" class="t s1_173">the unconscious becomes restless unless you satisfy it. As he accepted that perhaps they are</div>
<div id="t14_173" class="t s1_173">both of equal status, the restlessness disappeared.</div>
<div id="t15_173" class="t s1_173">And this is from a man who is very intelligent, a genius -- not only about the world but</div>
<div id="t16_173" class="t s1_173">about himself also. He is watching how his mind functions. His intellect is saying that it is</div>
<div id="t17_173" class="t s1_173">absolutely certain, but his unconscious feels disturbed. The unconscious is nine times bigger</div>
<div id="t18_173" class="t s1_173">than your conscious, and to feel the unconscious disturbed is a kind of sickness, a nausea. To</div>
