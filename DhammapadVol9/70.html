<div id="t2_70" class="t s1_70">Do you want more? Year in and year out I go on speaking to you every day. </div>
<div id="t3_70" class="t s1_70">But there are a few people... they don't come to listen, they don't come here. They avoid </div>
<div id="t4_70" class="t s1_70">the commune, but they go on sitting in the Blue Diamond,* and a few foolish people go </div>
<div id="t5_70" class="t s1_70">on meeting them there. And they roll up their eyes and they pretend to go in a trance, </div>
<div id="t6_70" class="t s1_70">and then they start talking nonsense. The more nonsense it is, the more philosophical it </div>
<div id="t7_70" class="t s1_70">seems, the more metaphysical it seems. And they always get a few people to listen to </div>
<div id="t8_70" class="t s1_70">them, to follow them. It is a strange phenomenon, but somehow the pseudo has an </div>
<div id="t9_70" class="t s1_70">appeal. </div>
<div id="ta_70" class="t s1_70">One thing about the pseudo master is that he manages a facade, he wears a mask. He </div>
<div id="tb_70" class="t s1_70">wears a mask that you would like him to wear. He fulfills your expectations. The true </div>
<div id="tc_70" class="t s1_70">master never fulfills anybody's expectations. </div>
<div id="td_70" class="t s1_70">Jesus proved that he was a true master because at the last moment he frustrated </div>
<div id="te_70" class="t s1_70">everybody, even his closest disciples. They were hoping that he would do some miracle: </div>
<div id="tf_70" class="t s1_70">"If he can raise people from death, if he can cure blind people, if he can cure crippled </div>
<div id="tg_70" class="t s1_70">persons, he is going to do something when he will be crucified. Some great miracle is </div>
<div id="th_70" class="t s1_70">going to happen</div>
<div id="ti_70" class="t s1_70">....</div>
<div id="tj_70" class="t s1_70">" And nothing happened, nothing at all! That proves his authenticity. </div>
<div id="tk_70" class="t s1_70">He was not there to fulfill your expectations. </div>
<div id="tl_70" class="t s1_70">But the pseudo master always tries to fulfill your expectations. Sometimes he manages </div>
<div id="tm_70" class="t s1_70">beautifully. Sometimes he will do miracles. </div>
<div id="tn_70" class="t s1_70">I know one man. He told his story to me himself because he fell in love with me. He was </div>
<div id="to_70" class="t s1_70">worshipped by many as enlightened. By and by he became tired of playing the role. It is </div>
<div id="tp_70" class="t s1_70">tiring. When you are not enlightened and you have to pretend to be enlightened and </div>
<div id="tq_70" class="t s1_70">you have even to manage a few miracles, it is tiring. </div>
<div id="tr_70" class="t s1_70">He came to see me. He cried and wept and he said, "Save me from my followers! I am </div>
<div id="ts_70" class="t s1_70">utterly tired and bored, and I have to do things just to keep them satisfied." He said to </div>
<div id="tt_70" class="t s1_70">me, "Once I had to do a miracle because my followers were expecting something big so </div>
<div id="tu_70" class="t s1_70">that many more people can come." </div>
<div id="tv_70" class="t s1_70">Followers are also interested that if many more people come to THEIR master, they feel </div>
<div id="tw_70" class="t s1_70">that they are with the right person. If they are alone with the master, then they start </div>
<div id="tx_70" class="t s1_70">feeling a little doubtful. Nobody believes in his own being, nobody trusts in his own </div>
<div id="ty_70" class="t s1_70">intelligence. When you see thousands of people you say, "It must be right. So many </div>
<div id="tz_70" class="t s1_70">people can't be wrong." Remember, the reality is just the opposite: so many people can't </div>
<div id="t10_70" class="t s1_70">be right! </div>
<div id="t11_70" class="t s1_70">The man said to me, "I had to manage a miracle. I stopped a train for seven minutes." </div>
<div id="t12_70" class="t s1_70">I said, "How did you manage it?" </div>
<div id="t13_70" class="t s1_70">He said, "Simple! I had to bribe three persons. One was the ticket collector. I had </div>
<div id="t14_70" class="t s1_70">managed it that I would be traveling without the ticket and he would come and ask for </div>
<div id="t15_70" class="t s1_70">the ticket. And I would get angry and I would say, 'There is no need for any ticket for </div>
<div id="t16_70" class="t s1_70">me. We are saints and we are allowed every freedom.' So I became very angry. When I </div>
<div id="t17_70" class="t s1_70">became angry, he became angry -- he was bribed and he was told to become very </div>
<div id="t18_70" class="t s1_70">angry." He pushed the man outside the railway compartment. </div>
