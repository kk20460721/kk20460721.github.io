<div id="t1_102" class="t s1_102">Religion really consists in creating a different kind of morality, not the so-called </div>
<div id="t2_102" class="t s1_102">ordinary morality, but a morality which is spontaneous, a morality which arises by </div>
<div id="t3_102" class="t s1_102">itself and is not imposed, a morality which is a consequence of your own intelligence. </div>
<div id="t4_102" class="t s1_102">Buddha is talking about that when he says: The master IS CALM. He means that he has </div>
<div id="t5_102" class="t s1_102">gone deep into his center, he has penetrated his being to the very core, and he has </div>
<div id="t6_102" class="t s1_102">settled there; now he is at rest. All hustle and bustle has dropped, all running hither and </div>
<div id="t7_102" class="t s1_102">thither has disappeared. Now he knows there is nowhere to go. He has arrived home, </div>
<div id="t8_102" class="t s1_102">he has found his ultimate shelter, the ultimate refuge. Now he knows, "This is my </div>
<div id="t9_102" class="t s1_102">shrine." Sitting in that shrine he is absolutely calm. You cannot see where he is, but you </div>
<div id="ta_102" class="t s1_102">can feel his calm. You can feel him like a cool breeze, you can feel him as a shower of </div>
<div id="tb_102" class="t s1_102">silence. If you come close to him, suddenly you will be touched by something invisible. </div>
<div id="tc_102" class="t s1_102">Your heart will start dancing. Not that he has done anything to you, but your mind can </div>
<div id="td_102" class="t s1_102">deceive you, your mind can start rationalizing. </div>
<div id="te_102" class="t s1_102">Just the other day I was reading a manuscript. One woman came a few months ago, a </div>
<div id="tf_102" class="t s1_102">friend of Pankaja and Savita. She came here just to see what had happened to Pankaja </div>
<div id="tg_102" class="t s1_102">and Savita. Pankaja is a well-known novelist and has published beautiful novels. </div>
<div id="th_102" class="t s1_102">Suddenly she became a sannyasin and dropped her beautiful career. There were great </div>
<div id="ti_102" class="t s1_102">possibilities: she could have become world-famous. She was on the way -- she was </div>
<div id="tj_102" class="t s1_102">becoming more and more known. Not only did she become a sannyasin, she never went </div>
<div id="tk_102" class="t s1_102">back to England. Not only that -- rumors must have reached England that now she </div>
<div id="tl_102" class="t s1_102">functions in the ashram as a toilet cleaner. Her friend must have been puzzled -- what </div>
<div id="tm_102" class="t s1_102">had happened to her? </div>
<div id="tn_102" class="t s1_102">Then Savita also disappeared. She was also doing well in her profession. She was a </div>
<div id="to_102" class="t s1_102">therapist, earning a lot of money and moving ahead. And she also never returned to </div>
<div id="tp_102" class="t s1_102">England. </div>
<div id="tq_102" class="t s1_102">Their friend came here just to see what was happening to these people -- "They must </div>
<div id="tr_102" class="t s1_102">have been hypnotized." What else can the mind think? The simple explanation comes to </div>
<div id="ts_102" class="t s1_102">the mind: "These people have been hypnotized." Otherwise why should one leave one's </div>
<div id="tt_102" class="t s1_102">prosperous career, good livelihood -- a career which was full of possibilities? Why </div>
<div id="tu_102" class="t s1_102">should one suddenly leave? Either one has gone insane or one has become hypnotized. </div>
<div id="tv_102" class="t s1_102">She came here just to observe what is happening. Then she also became a sannyasin. </div>
<div id="tw_102" class="t s1_102">But she escaped immediately -- I gave her the name Kanan. She escaped. Now she </div>
<div id="tx_102" class="t s1_102">writes a book about the whole experience and she says, "I don't know what happened, </div>
<div id="ty_102" class="t s1_102">why I became a sannyasin. There is something which pulls you. There is something </div>
<div id="tz_102" class="t s1_102">intangible -- one cannot figure it out, what it is exactly -- but something like hypnosis." </div>
<div id="t10_102" class="t s1_102">She infers, "It may be in the eyes of this man or in the sound of his voice that one feels to </div>
<div id="t11_102" class="t s1_102">become a sannyasin. Even I became a sannyasin, but then I became very much afraid: </div>
<div id="t12_102" class="t s1_102">now I am being pulled the same way into this orange whirlpool in which Pankaja has </div>
<div id="t13_102" class="t s1_102">disappeared, Savita has disappeared. It is better to go before I am too much in it and </div>
<div id="t14_102" class="t s1_102">escape becomes impossible. I escaped. I dropped sannyas immediately because I was </div>
<div id="t15_102" class="t s1_102">afraid -- carrying this man's mala and his picture around my neck was dangerous. Who </div>
<div id="t16_102" class="t s1_102">knows what is hidden in it?" </div>
